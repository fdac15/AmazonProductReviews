"Half the reason I want a case is to make the phone more grippable. This case is slippery polycarbonate plastic on the sides. It does seem like it would provide a little bit of shock guard if the phone were dropped on its edge or face. The charging and headphone cutouts are on the small side and I could not fit my Monoprice charging cable into the port while the case was on. I used a dremel tool to enlarge the charging port. Overall, decent for a couple bucks but still looking for a better case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291PBT1OAKPX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSZP7XE#wasThisHelpful","R291PBT1OAKPX4","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great looking--looks more like furniture than a filing cabinet. It is close to the brown-black bedroom furniture from Ikea--not identical but close enough that it blends. The box arrived pretty beat up, but there was no damages to any of the pieces. Quality is typical for this type of particle-board/MDF furniture. All of the holes lined up except for one, and that one was only slightly off so it required just a bit of widening with a screwdriver.I wanted something sturdy and relatively permanent, so I took the time to add construction adhesive to all the joints and connection points. I plan to put a flat screen TV on top, and it will support the weight with no problem.The mechanism to allow only one drawer at a time to open is pretty simple, and it works. It would not stand up to a lot of force, but that's not its purpose.There's no detente when the drawers are closed, and they do seem to have a tendency to come open. That's probably more an issue with my floors being level rather than an issue with the cabinet. I expect a couple of small shims under the front of the cabinet will remedy this.The handles are shiny plastic and pretty awful, but I bought solid brushed nickel ones at Home Depot for $4 each. It was well worth the trouble to replace them because it makes a big difference.  Cabinet handles come in different widths; purchase the ones that are 96 MM (4 3/4 inches) between screws. I did have to add a few washers to the inside of the drawer because the screws with the new handles were a little long, Spend an extra buck and get a few washers just in case.The bottoms of the drawers are fiberboard and won't hold a lot of weight. However, that's okay because the cabinet is intended for hanging files, so the weight is distributed on the rails at the top of the drawers.  Legal files fit laterally from side to side.  There are also bars to hang two rows of letter size files front-to-back. All rails are plastic, but they seem like they are strong enough.I do wish the cabinet had a lock, but I knew it did not have before I purchased.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7NHXBQRBTAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D4VKWK#wasThisHelpful","R2R7NHXBQRBTAW","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great and comes with everything needed for an easy install.  The protector does not go to the edge of the phone--in fact it barely covers the viewable area. It should have been about 1/8 inch wider and taller. The ""wet"" wipe had dried out, but that was not enough of a problem to deduct another star.Update:  A few weeks after I installed this, I dropped my phone face down on the asphalt.  There were 2 large pits in the front, but I was not worried because it was just the cheap screen protector that was chipped and not the phone.  I replaced the screen protector with the same brand and the phone looks like new again.  Moral of the story--get a screen protector.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6X0QGX3EFFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN1T6NM#wasThisHelpful","RF6X0QGX3EFFA","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The heat cycle works just fine, but the cool cycle only cools the yogurt to 80 degrees F which is pretty weak since the temperature in my house is 75 degrees F.I put the batch in at about 4 PM with the default 8 hour cycle. I expected to wake up the next morning (11 hours later) to chilled yogurt, but instead found room temperature yogurt. The yogurt tasted okay, but it's pretty hard to screw up yogurt and I've had success with a fairly wide variety of temperature & time combinations. I believe I could have gotten the same result by simply using a heating pad with a simple timer, or using my oven bread proof mode with its timer.Since the only function this provides for the expensive purchase price seems to be a small heater with timer, I can only give 1 star because there are much cheaper products and other mechanisms that accomplish the exact same thing with very little cost.Called Cuisinart and they recommended exchanging. I'm sending back but will probably not get a replacement.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKIOTDL40F8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARSC1MK#wasThisHelpful","RDKIOTDL40F8G","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some genuinely entertaining moments in the spirit of Christopher Moore or Terry Pratchett, but overall a mediocre book.  The ending was especially abrupt--very much in the style of ""I have to finish this in a couple days for the publishing deadline, so let's put a simple happily ever after on all the plot lines and tie it up in a bow.""

"I've used the Lutron version before, and those are becoming harder to find and slightly more expensive so I ordered this one.  The Thomas & Betts version has an indicator lamp which is the only plus.  The build quality of Thomas & Betts feels inferior to Lutron.  The big problem is that the switch operation is not smooth--there is a detent in the off position (similar to Lutron, which is good) but there is also a detent at the full on position which makes the switch operation far from smooth.  In my application I want accurate and fine control, so I will go back to using the Lutron version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QX04LS01537Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001118DII#wasThisHelpful","R1QX04LS01537Z","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This works great, though I wish that it came in satin nickel and was metal instead of plastic.  I wanted this to switch out a couple of different hand-held shower heads. I researched for quite a while online and this is the only product that seems to provide a quick change option for a reasonable price. I installed in about 5 minutes. No teflon plumber's tape is required because the seal is made using a couple of gaskets on the face of the adjoining fixtures. I did notice that in one case I needed to use a thicker gasket than came with this coupler, but I took the thicker gasket from the existing hand-held shower and that worked fine. This coupler is made of plastic with a chrome finish and seems about as well made as plastic can be and I expect it will hold up under occasional use. It does not leak, and if it does start to leak, I expect that I can get replacement gaskets & o-rings at the local hardware store. Even though it is chrome finished and the rest of my bathroom is brushed nickel, it's really not that noticeable a difference.  I am planning to buy a second one because it's a reasonably inexpensive part and just in case the plastic does happen to break and I can't find anything else similar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H89KXOEUDJHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016H1QFE#wasThisHelpful","R2H89KXOEUDJHJ","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disappointed with build quality. Bought two of these about a year ago and have used them fairly lightly only during occasional travel.  One of them is now failing to reliably charge my iPhone--I get the dreaded ""Accessory not supported"" message. I know this issue is due to the cable deteriorating since one cable still works with the same charger/phone.  But--I am very frustrated that Apple chose to engineer their products to ensure that non-Apple chargers won't charge at all. Apparently their idea of ensuring a good user experience means that NO charging is better than SLOW charging.

"I'm getting to that age where I appreciate the finer things in life, such as fine companionship, fine wine, fine food, and being able to read a damn menu in a fine dining establishment. Apparently, to qualify as ""fine dining"", a restaurant must be lit by no more then 3 candles strategically placed on non-adjacent tables so that there is no direct light whatsoever hitting my menu. Enter the rimless tube readers. These things are TINY and fit into a case that's not much bigger than a pencil, but in a pinch allow me read menus and playbills. They even fit in the pockets of those tight leather pants I should have stopped wearing at the end of the Reagan era. They're not intended for long-term use if you're doing serious reading, but the compact size ensures that they can always be on hand if you need them when out & about. I have a couple pairs of drugstore reading glasses of the same power and even though the lenses on these are smaller, the optical quality is obviously much higher.  I expect I will be a long time customer because I I think I will always have a couple pairs of these onhand in my computer & messenger bags.

"The Take is an intense crime tale with intrigue, betrayal, murder, and great dramatic build-up.John Leguizamo plays Felix de la Pena, a security truck driver caught in a complex robbery scheme where the ruthless villain – played very coldly by Tyrese Gibson – has a series of moving parts to cover his tracks and potentially implicate de la Pena.  The deceit and twists are portrayed well enough to leave some doubt as to who exactly is involved in the crime, and to what lengths each will go to preserve their freedom.  Agent Perelli (Cannavale), the lead detective on the case, is an even-tempered man who, despite mounting evidence, has a difficult time finding Leguizamo's character guilty.  Add in the hellish world being married to Rosie Perez must be, and it is easy to see why a man could potentially commit a crime that may ruin his life.The ending, while a little anti-climactic, is gritty and realistic.  No heroes.  No masterful revenge.  No regular Joe turning into Charles Bronson.  Just an awaiting, inevitable ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THGH4FM7PUZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00151QYXA#wasThisHelpful","R3THGH4FM7PUZC","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fully develop characters present the evils of the methamphetamine world and those who suffer as a result.

"The foot, ankle, and calf compression feels great during exercise.  Post-run I still had a nice squeeze.  Whether or not the science behind it is legit is something above me medical knowledge, but what I do know is that these compression socks make my legs - particularly my calves - feel good.  The fit and contour is excellent, provided the socks are put on the correct feet.The only negative I have for this product is the moisture wicking aspect.  While my feet don't slide in the socks, and the sweat is expelled fairly well, my feet slide in the shoes when on longer runs.

"The color and design is gender-neutral and unassuming.  I like that.  The changing pad is a perfect size, folds up easy, and fits in the bag just fine.

Size-wise, the entire kit is easy to lug around without being burdened by my wife's diaper bag that would get charged over-weight fees on commercial airliners.  It fits enough diapers that I don't have to worry about anything if I'm gone for a few hours...even if there is a blowout involved.The only downside I see to this kit, and it's sort of nit-picking, is that there isn't suitable room for a wipes case.  Sure, there's room for a ziplock baggy of a few, or a portable case of a few, but to get ""down and dirty"" - you know what I'm talking about - running out of wipes is a disaster.

"After the great War of Chicago, there are Transformer parts and carcasses lying about like nuts and bolts at the bottom of a toolbox.  Those not destroyed have gone deep undercover, remaining the barely noticeable sentient robots that can turn into cars, jets, etc., who fear humanity’s reprisal.  To maximize concealment, a post-war Optimus Prime parks inside an old theater in disrepair.  You know, to be inconspicuous with the rest of the trucks at the movie theater.  Oh wait.  It’s just him?  Scratch that then.  Good thing nobody noticed him.  Nevermind…a wannabe American Picker named Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) “stumbles” upon the scene, and the elephant in the room is almost literal, except replace elephant with alien, shape-shifting, bullet-riddled, rocket-filled semi in a movie theater.After a quick tow home to his nearly repossessed farm where is super-hot daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) is lamenting the fact that her father can’t pay the bills, Cade hooks the rig up to a battery and TADA!, Optimus Prime is shape-shifting, dropping parts like a robot leper, and waxing philosophic about the comrades he has lost.  The bad news for both Yeager and Prime is that a CIA agent named Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) has teamed up with the intergalactic version of Dog the Bounty Hunter – thankfully without Beth – to capture/destroy all remaining Transformers.  Some level of government deceit is present, as many involved believe on the Decepticons are being targeted, but that does not compute to Optimus Prime.  The rest of the movie is a battle of survival against the government, the Decepticons, Dog the Bounty Hunter, and the film’s run-time.Speaking of run-time…165 minutes.  Really?  One wouldn’t think a movie filled with Michael Bay ejaculate (i.e. explosions) every other minute would be boring, but the film drags on.  Considering the various unnecessary subplots involving TJ Miller as nothing more than a Star Trek redshirt, Bingbing Li as a complete throwaway character, the tired “over-protective father won’t let his hot daughter date”-angle, the inclusion of a pointless boyfriend and associated romance, and a bomb/seed that helps Transformer-terraform a world, there really is some serious editing that could have been done.  Considering the lengthy and expensive FX, much of which becomes pretty repetitive towards the end, I’m sure viewers wouldn’t miss an explosion here or there.  You know it’s bad when the Dinobots make an appearance and I’m too drained to care much.Wahlberg is a huge improvement over Labeouf.  In every way possible.  To be quite honest, I even preferred Peltz to Megan Fox, but purely for the change of scenery and the super-short shorts Peltz painted on for most of the scenes.  The FX and sound are obviously outstanding, maybe the best I’ve ever seen/heard.Great for Transformer diehards and teenage boys, OK for cinephiles and anyone looking for a mindless explosion festival, rentable for most others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W039KA2CP32O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4K3MLE#wasThisHelpful","R3W039KA2CP32O","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this book has many positives, I'd like to start this review by briefly focusing on the negatives.The cons of the book are clear.  Children can cheer and clap at chronicles containing comedy, characters, and simple concepts - child's play.  Confronting children with challenging concepts of conservation, conversely, could conceivably confuse children if alliteration considerations are anything above circumstantial or carefully calculated.  I think I've made my point.  One other issue I have is the unevenness of the pictures and wording.  Instead of paragraphs, which are often difficult for children to listen to, pictures in children's books should flow with the words.  The pictures should tell the story along with the words.  Easier for young minds to remember and enjoy.  I don't believe this book accomplishes the harmony required for its target audience.Having said all that, I thought the illustrations were easy to grasp.  My daughter immediately started pointing at pictures and telling me what each item was.  Some new items (like the dropper) stumped her, but I enjoyed the blend of common and uncommon.  Additionally, the colors are bright, vibrant, and easy on the eyes.  Some of the wording, particularly from the dropper (i.e. ""drop, drop, drop""), are fun to play around with.  I ad-libbed some hand movements and a tickle game into that portion of the book.  The size and thickness of the pages points to this being better for an older audience (5-8 is good).  The various scientific concepts are a great way of introducing complex concepts in a simple manner - my favorite is the chalk circles around the puddles.Overall this is an above average book that serves as a springboard for inquisitive minds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1T0W5K8L713/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477847308#wasThisHelpful","R3O1T0W5K8L713","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Get a bag, pour, shake the bag, pour one more time and it's just about right.  What's more, it completely regenerated some semi-stale popcorn I had from the last movie outing.

Others, however, those like me, having been in or around the military every day of my life, it reads like a hilariously accurate, day-by-day account of military life in some respects, and a completely heart-wrenching detail of what war does to our military in others.

To overcome this issue she attends a party where her smeared-lipstick, drunken whore of a friend (Alice Macdonald as Alice) gets her smashed enough that she accepts a drink from a stranger named BJ (Simon Barrett) and later has intercourse with him in an uncomfortable location (get your mind out of the gutter!

"What happens when a U.S. President's kids get killed by internationally-connected and funded drug cartels?  Basically Operation Swordfish with drones, as Troy Pearce, CEO of Pearce Systems, is called upon to unleash hell via a squadron of drones.The topic’s timeliness is fairly current, with drone technology becoming more pervasive in American warfare.  Similarly, the tech aspects and military jargon is legit, and no so deep as to be off-putting.  The plot itself – a U.S. President utilizing spec-ops folks to conduct a secret mission to take out individual adversaries – is realistic enough that it has been successfully accomplished in recent memory.  I have worked with the government sector, aviation in particular, enough to have shaken a hand or two that might be called on to perform such a real-world action.  Having said that, any situation where there is a potential war between the US and Mexico has to be discounted somewhat.  The conclusion would be the U.S. taking a huge dump on Mexico, resulting in what would be a 51st state named “Texas’s Diaper.”  I felt the inclusion of the Russians and Iranians was supposed to smooth out that rough edge, but it’s just not very realistic in my opinion.I mostly enjoyed the blend of characters, and while reading could see the script come to life through specific actors.  The primary players represents a wide variety of people, and could easily be an Ocean’s Eleven cast.  Speaking of that, the one small issue I had with the novel is the fact that it just felt like too much was going on.  Too many moving pieces.

Meanwhile, a long lost MIA/POW places a distress call to which Triple Seven has to respond.Shadow Catcher has a good blend of personal and professional.  The character development and interweaving relationships are both handled very well, with just enough mix to make it enjoyable without turning into a parody of military novel character building.  Similarly, the military jargon and details avoid the esoteric, making it perfect for the average POG.  Detail-oriented and well-researched, but not to the extent of someone like Neal Stephenson, the novel is fast-paced, enjoyable, and a quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QALXNXWZKFTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266877#wasThisHelpful","R2QALXNXWZKFTG","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In terms of simplicity and comfort, this is a top-notch product.  It's as simple as fitting the loop over the dog's head, and attaching one buckle.  I am very pleased with this aspect.  There appears to be enough padding to avoid any sort of chafing, and even if there weren't, the seams are far enough back that they don't rub the underarm area.The one issue I have is with the fact that most dogs, being stubborn with new things, won't like being pulled along by this product.  I suppose they don't like the traditional neck-collar either, but this one definitely takes some getting used to.  Once my doberman realized what it was, things were fine.  The very few times she pulls it works out perfect.  I even prefer it to the neck collar because I can lift her with minimal issues when situations arise.  She just didn't want to budge at first and she was less responsive to the pulling.Good product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQJWB924XZ7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003G84TZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3GQJWB924XZ7W","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Presumably someone buys this because they own a larger dog that would benefit from easier access bowls.  The height is fine.  The stability is also very good, with a wide enough base that the entire set doesn't topple, and rubber grips that keep the bowls relatively still.  The one flaw, however, is the bowl volume.  If my dog is big enough to need elevated bowls, then my dog also requires increased food quantity.  This bowl requires more often filling than our previous bowls.If it's a matter of my minor inconvenience versus the dog's strained neck, it's an easy choice.  I just wish the bowls were a little bigger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIW3R0K3APX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00973K1QE#wasThisHelpful","R2DIW3R0K3APX5","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have reviewed both films separately, and both earned high praise for good reason.""In Hell"" feature JCVD in a corrupt Russian prison that pits inmates against one another for the amusement of the guards and upper staff.  It's kill or be killed, with weaklings served to conquering champions like so many scraps of meat.  This is one of JCVD's more nuanced performances, where he takes a small step away from the typical splits, jump kicks, and slow-motion fight scenes.  It's a gritty, brutal display of combat, despair, and perhaps even a slight bit of psychosis.  Overall the movie has a ton of action, and acceptable plot, and is severely underappreciated.""Wake of Death"" is perhaps JCVD's Magnum Opus.  In a movie where he must reach his darkest moment, JCVD manages to balance the attributes all his fans love (e.g. high flying kicks) with a violent action movie rivaling the concept behind so many revenge flicks (think Death Wish).  I can't express enough how exciting the action is in this movie.  Including what I contend is one of the 5 best car chase scenes in cinema history, there is not a single pause in the film.  From beginning to end there is something exploding, a kick breaking someone's face, or blood splatter flying against a wall.This is just about as good as it gets in terms of a JCVD-DVD combo package.  Highly rewatchable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMHFV7TLHFGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001688UMK#wasThisHelpful","R1GMHFV7TLHFGA","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, the boring stuff.  The packaging is cute.  It's a blue box that can be ripped open to act as tray and storage.  Put it on the bottom shelf in the pantry and watch the kiddo feed herself.  It's kind of like a 12-pack of soda, how opening one end makes the box suddenly functional.  Now, let's get down to brass tacks.My daughter (20 months) inhales this stuff.  It's liquid crack.  She learned the word ""pouch"" VERY quickly.  We unscrew the cap (great design/implementation for reseal/reuse) and hand the pouch to her.  A few seconds later and she's either asking for help or more.  Help because she can't get the stuff at the bottom, and she can feel the difference in the bag.  More because she obviously needs her fix.  We'll probably need to detox her later on.  She eats regular table food (demolishes cucumbers and pizza), but she absolutely loves these.  Works great when we're on the go or when she's being a picky eater.To be thorough I gave one a small taste.  They are pretty bitter to the adult palate; well, they are bitter to me.  Out of the three fruits listed, I'd say blueberry won the battle by a wide margin.  Very tasty, but strong.We've tried several other brands of fruit/veggie puree, and I'd have to say she likes this one the best.  For whatever that's worth.Great product.

"This is probably not the book for dividend growth investors or buy-and-hold types.  The description points to universality, but it’s probably a step above a Dummies book, and definitely isn’t targeted to a typical investor.  Make no mistake, investing is not trading.  This book is for those who want to trade stocks.  Buy low, sell high, get in and get out with a profit.Some of the financial tech stuff is a bit esoteric, but I guess that’s the point.  In order to truly understand and trade, one must have a semi-firm grasp on financial statements, market trends, complex analysis, etc.  With that said, however, this book is probably just right for the would-be trader.  The investor who wants more, who wants to learn trend and day trading basics.

"After countless cramps and difficulties with marathon distance runs, I’ve looked high and low for the answers.  As such, one of my searches took me towards yoga and increased flexibility, not to mention core strength and improved breathing.  Which is interesting, because author Christine Felstead goes into great details in the beginning stages of her book to impress upon readers why yoga is so beneficial to runners. From injuries to breathing, Felstead’s quite thorough.Subsequently, the book has a detailed look at 88 poses focusing on the various muscle groups and how they relate to running.  What I like most about this part is that it’s not simply an explanation of how to do the pose, but also what to do to avoid injury.  As a yoga novice, I can attest to the fact that yoga is difficult and can hurt if done too strenuously or incorrectly.As if the book were intended specifically for me, there is even a section called “Yoga Off the Mat,” which is focused on poses that can be done at work, behind the desk.  Pretty great stuff for those of us who don’t waste half the day on “smoke breaks.”I intend to fully implement this at the work place in the very near future.  With any luck it will be just one more thing in my runner’s arsenal with which I can attack the next hill, marathon, or if I’m lucky, ultra.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5CV11B0OTI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450434177#wasThisHelpful","RO5CV11B0OTI2","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Kilian Jornet (Burgada) takes us from childhood through current accomplishments, providing a few details about a variety of running philosophies, psychologies, and training plans along the way.  As an accomplished ski mountaineer and mountain runner, his accomplishments are quite esoteric, but they are nonetheless impressive.  It's just that the stories themselves are terribly interesting or exciting.The major strength of this memoir is that he really does let us inside his mind and his psyche.  I related to the story about a song getting stuck in his head, because I've often lost a mile or two before realizing I was thinking about a song, or a sport, or bacon during that period of time.  Very useful strategy.  My take on Kilian is that he's equal part physically gifted, driven, and psychologically strong.  The lattermost item being the most important, he's able to self-motivate when necessary and distract when not.  That's an incredibly useful tool for a long distance runner or ultra-athlete.Nonetheless, the title of my review is kind of my take on the book.  If you've seen the movie Dodgeball, you'll get the reference in the title.  A lot of this book just seems repetitive; others have hinted at it being a translation issue.  It's just not a terribly organized or interesting book.  Those looking for a good Ultra book should read Dean Karnazes instead.  Those interested in a motivating running book, try Meb Keflezighi's work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB7K89V88EYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937715094#wasThisHelpful","R1DB7K89V88EYX","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I want in a hand sanitizer is simple:Foam + Clean Feeling - Scent - WetnessThis product fits the bill.I never get sick.  My daughter is impeccably healthy.  My wife and I clean pretty regularly, but don't go overboard.  She probably uses this more than I do.  Heck, I don't wash my hands all that regularly (they get washed in the shower).  Admittedly, I'm probably the wrong father for this product.  It seems the more over-sanitized and medicated we become, the worse we are.  Just yesterday I let my daughter eat something off the floor.  On purpose.  The more I expose her to, the better.  But when presented with a small way to potentially improve health, I decided to give this product a try.  When I happen to think about it, I use this hand sanitizer, but it's not a habit by any means.What I like about this product is the foam.  It's pleasant on the hands, doesn't dry skin out, and dissipates very quickly.  Absolutely zero smell.  And when I use it my hands feel clean.Does it work?  I think so.  Is it safe?  Other reviewers - some no doubt followers of Jenny McCarthy and lots of late nights searching ""my baby coughed"" on WebMD - are going crazy about a chemical I've never heard of, but thus far nobody in my circle of family/friends has had an issue.  It seems the most contentious ingredient is benzalkonium chloride, and after a bit of research, it appears to be a chemical so ubiquitous that if you were to avoid it here you'll almost certainly run into it elsewhere.

"Like his character cracks skulls and leathery-faced smiles, Gunnar Hansen, the original Leatherface, cracks the spine of his old note-ridden manuscripts to serve as diarist/historian for Tobe Hooper’s legendary The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.  Revealing previously unknown details and personal anecdotes, Hansen dispatches rumors and stories like unwanted intruders, providing the kind of behind-the-scenes information all commentary tracks should envy.For any Chainsaw fan, this is an absolute must have.

"What most kids' toys require are vibrant colors, responsive controls, and loud noises.  This toy lacks all three.The screen is the first issue.  It's small.  And dark.  Real dark.  On top if that, it's very old looking technology that will not interest a kid who has seen the world of iPhones and computers.  For the computer folks like me, think less Java and more BASIC.The controls are rudimentary at best.  Lots of options aren't necessarily better than the fewer good options.  I could probably wash windows with a gallon of toilet water, but I'm gonna go with Windex instead.  It's not really worth mentioning the numerous options - there are plenty - because only one or two will hold a child's attention long enough to give Daddy time to catch a breather.The volume is poor, and it's not a big shocker.

"After replacing pretty much my entire toilet, I was left with one small issue: leaky flapper.  That sounds like a personal issue of some sort, but I'm talking about the toilet.This product's positives are easy to produce:1) No reliance on old flapper that is independent of the overflow tube.2) No mounting ears required3) Fit my toilet like a charm, and I suspect it would fit nearly all toilets.4) Zero leaking, and a very tight seal5) The ""caulking compound"" (it's putty) was malleable and easy to install.  Everything fit and sealed the very first time.6) Ample chain to attach to the handleThe basics of this product are a putty ring, a two piece flapper with a hinge, and a chain/hook.  Apply the putty ring, ensure a tight fit, push down on the flapper ring component for a second tight fit, and then attach the chain.  Easy.  The putty ring is ample, will certainly last quite some time.  There is even a replacement valve in case the one attached to the flapper fails.My toilet is not leaking, which makes me a happy camper.

"My toilet kept running, and since I’m not a fast guy I decided to fix it before it got away.  Pun aside, that’s why I bought the Fluidmaster 400A Anti-Siphon Toilet Tank Fill Valve.  I’m moderately pleased, and a little disappointed.First off, the issue with my toilet was multi-faceted.  One, the flapper wasn’t sealing correctly.  Two, the float ball was not functioning properly on my older model; it was bobbing. No matter the adjustment, it sunk to the overflow tube because of a faulty valve in the refill valve assembly.  I wanted to get away from the float ball conundrum, so this was a good purchase.The installation was easy enough, with one catch.  The tubing to the water connection – all four listed types – do not match up with the enclosed parts.  The cone washer and coupling nut that connect the tubing to the lock nut on the threaded shank won’t go over the top of the typical tubing.  Hence, no connection.  Of the four (Metal/Copper Flared, Metal Flanged, Metal Spiral, Vinyl/Braided) I had the Metal Flanged Tubing, with its existing coupling nut and plastic cone washer.  Once installed, it’s not a good idea to reuse that because the threading slice made into the plastic cone washer might not seal properly.  As a result, I planned on using the cone washer and the coupling nut provided in the installation kit.  Well, that’s impossible because every tubing piece sold by Home Depot and Lowe’s literally doesn’t fit the enclosed coupling nut and/or cone washer.  Luckily these pieces are pretty universal, and I bought a cheap vinyl/braided connector.  It doesn’t, however, solve the “leftover parts”-dilemma that plagues everyone at the end of plumbing installation.The only other sketchy part of this installation is the 1/8th counterclockwise rotation required for the valve top.  My system is working right now, but the point if this isn’t clear and it felt very breakable.  I’m guessing the lugs are very fragile.So, minor installation and leftover parts issues aside, I think it works thus far.  Now on to the flapper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9I3R02VPXAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002ND6R#wasThisHelpful","RV9I3R02VPXAE","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is perfect as a supplement to normal feeding.  Most toddlers are peculiar about eating.  We call my daughter a grazer.  She grazes and grabs a cucumber slice.  Then a cracker.  Then nothing.  All she wants is candy, cookie, etc.  (Amazing how quickly they learn those words, huh?)  So we are very lucky she really likes the formula.  Some days it’s all she wants, running into the room whining, telling me she wants “mek-mek,” which sometimes sounds like “meh-meh” and I ask her why she’s so blasé about everything.  Toddlers with rumbling tummies don’t understand Daddy humor.Anyway, our secret concoction is one scoop of this vanilla flavored stuff, one scoop of the regular one, and some whole milk to top things off.  She loves it.  Of course, she’d probably always choose a Capri-Sun or a small sip of Daddy’s soda, but 99 times out of a 100 she’s extremely happy to get her “mek.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBUHRKW9SBJ27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZAI6QE#wasThisHelpful","RBUHRKW9SBJ27","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Getting a toddler to happily and properly brush teeth is like putting a dog in a bathtub.  Good luck with that.  The Gund Brush Your Teeth Bear is an attempt to make it more tolerable.  How?First, generate excitement like it's something fun to do:""Ooohhh, Goody!""  I'm so excited to brush my teeth with you!""Then sing an enjoyable song (to the tune of ""Wheels on the Bus""):""Brush your teeth in the front.  Brush up and down.  Up and down.  Up and down.""The animation is great.  The bear rocks back and forth to the beat while the left hand makes a continuous brushing motion up and down.  The entire song/dance/brushing lasts about 2 minutes, has further encouragement, instruction for each area of the mouth (front, side, back, tongue), and finishes off with sparkling teeth.The Gund Bear is adorable, sturdy, instructional, and relevant.  The only flaw we've experienced is that the brushing arm can be misaligned if picked up during brushing, and it's difficult to move higher.  It ends up looking like the bear is brushing it's torso if you can't get the arm just right.  A minor concern if you pay attention to your little one when they are brushing and grabbing the bear.  And to be honest, if I can get my little one to associate hugs with brushing teeth, then I'm fine if she grabs it while it's in motion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCN3P0DLP2S5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGQQVPS#wasThisHelpful","R3DCN3P0DLP2S5","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We tried every diaper there is.  Even cloth, reusable.  The Pampers line, particularly the Cruisers, are the best diapers out there.  Even with the redesign.As the product description mentions, the snug fit adapts to the waist, legs, and bottom.  What that means is, the waist has two elastic straps that attach pretty easily.  Although, I must admit the redesign seemingly has worse adhesive than before.  Sometimes I have to put the tabs on one another and give them a quick rub or two to secure things.  My little one doesn't mind the extra attention.  The gussets are stretchy and capable, holding all leaks in without being so tight as to cause constriction.  Again, the redesign seems to be a little worse than before, with a small tearing issue when the gussets are pulled outwardly (kind of a necessity for them to work properly).  Once more, not a big deal.We have had no leak issues for quite some time, and my little cruiser twists more in her sleep than a crocodile snagging a feisty gazelle.  Zero chafing.  Long story short, the redesign may have more absorbency, but there is also minor downside.  Still the best diaper out there in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DIBB6DEA7ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDMIMP2#wasThisHelpful","R39DIBB6DEA7ZQ","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy looks great, sounds great, and is borderline perfection in theory.  In practice, however, there is a big problem.The motor/blower is activated by pushing the red button the elephant's yellow arm.  This causes balls put into the purple ears to shoot through the elephant's trunk.  After that, the balls are supposed to recycle through to the ears again, where they can go one of two ways.  The first is back through the blower and the trunk, and the second is into the ball reservoir on the elephant's stomach.  If only it were that perfect.  Instead, what you get is a ball that comes out of the trunk, bounces on the plastic ears, and only recycles about 1 in 5 times.  Of that 20%, less than one-half actually goes back to the ear leading to the trunk.  The trunk rotates to help alleviate some of this issue, but it's only partially successful.  After reading multiple reviews, I'm guessing it has to do with the battery or blower power.It's a great idea, and looks really fun.  The problem is, to keep the child's attention, the balls need to stay with the toy.  With ours, my daughter liked it for a bit, then the balls flew everywhere, then she lost interest.  Occasionally, however, I'll return to the toy and find out she has used it...to stuff something into the trunk.  Not a big deal when the item in question is other than circular.  But when the item is circular, particularly when it's a slightly larger, more rigid ball from a different toy, a parent - read: me - might have the unenviable task of disassembly.  Either that or you figure out to extract from the trunk.  I've done both, the latter with a coat hanger to puncture the lodged ball.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3AIPI4K0NB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S6A1QK#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3AIPI4K0NB5","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's not to love?  The taste of blueberry muffins always makes me reminisce a little, thinking about days as a child when my mother and aunt would cook breakfast together while the children played.  The muffins were always my favorite.  Warm, filling, with a great aroma that often overpowered the rest of the meal, I wanted them more than anything else.  And while this product doesn't quite live up to the memories, it's a pretty good substitute when I'm lazy.The muffins are nearly circular, so saying they are about 2.5-3"" in diameter is not inaccurate.  They are perfect poppers, straight to the molars.  The spongy texture isn't quite the deliciousness of a baked muffin with golden brown edges, but it's not bad for what it's worth.  Blueberries aren't ample, but they are sufficient enough that the taste is always present.  And with at least three sugar-related ingredients, the taste is sweet without being acrid.Health-wise, it's run of the mill.  180 calories per serving (i.e. 4 muffins), 70 of which come from fat.  Over half of the carbohydrates are simple (i.e. sugar), and there is 130mg of sodium per serving.  Speaking of the serving...This product suffers from what I like to call ""The Frito-Lay Deception.""  I know that sounds like a The Big Bang Theory episode title, but it's essentially when a bag looks much bigger than the contents.  In other words, tons of air, not much product.  Each bag says ""4 Muffins per pouch"" on the front, but it's still a surprise every time.  It leaves you wanting more for both hunger and psychological fulfillment purposes.Good for a side snack next to your meal, or when you're in a hurry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW4YYAUA4B18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F1V6M6#wasThisHelpful","R1BW4YYAUA4B18","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book for my wife while she was entering the first few weeks of her second pregnancy.  What we were looking for was a straight-forward approach that takes an expectant mother from conception to postpartum, providing details about health, exercise, nutrition, without delving too much into baby development and straying off course.  In that endeavor, this book is successful.  Chapters on conception, each trimester, labor, delivery, and postpartum walk a mother through each step of the way, focusing on how exercise and a healthy lifestyle affect everything from fertility to one's mental state.Kristina Pinto has provided a cautious, easy to read primer with great illustrations that solves common issues, answers common questions, provides an easy-to-follow path towards a healthy pregnancy, and a speedy, postpartum recovery.  The only minor negative is what others have noted: this isn't targeted towards the everyday Mommy to be.  It's targeted to pregnant mothers who were already in very good shape and who were already athletes.  A minor issue when coupled with the overall strength of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUQU0TDE07QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934030961#wasThisHelpful","R2SUQU0TDE07QS","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Military novels are a dime a dozen.  Culling out the unique perspective is what's difficult.  In that endeavor, I believe Andrei Gelasimov has succeeded.  War delivered through the eyes of a child - more aggressive but similar in ways to J. G. Ballard's Empire of the Sun - Gods of Steppe tells the story of a Russian boy named Petka living during WWII, who wishes he could aid his countrymen in the Red Army by fighting along the Russian-Chinese border.  Given that unreality, instead he gets into all sorts of mischief and eventually comes to the realization everything is not what he once believed.What I enjoyed about the novel was the realistic portrayal and description of war, as well as Petka's transformation.  His transformation is two-fold.  First, he's ""the bastard"" to everyone.  His mother had him at an early age, and his family life is disheveled in ways that include war, despair, and substance abuse.  But his interactions with the troops and camp guards is reinvigorating.  Similarly, after initially being nave and capricious, some harsh experiences altered his war-time perceptions.  Enemies and allies sometimes swap.  Family isn't always trustworthy.  Safety and danger are often illusions.  His interactions with the Japanese POW reminded me initial stages of the tragic friendship formed in Boyne's The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.The negative of this novel is the delivery.  At times it feels disjointed.  It's not terribly difficult to follow, particularly for someone engrossed in the tale, but I could see it causing issues for some readers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68VWLZZULEDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611090733#wasThisHelpful","R68VWLZZULEDS","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loves Sophia the First.  I've been forced to watch the cartoon so much that I can sing the song and know all the characters.  I figured I would get a game that she'd love when of the appropriate age.  I have to say I'm quite disappointed.First and foremost, the number of pieces to lose is ridiculous.  Forty four cardboard castle cutouts, sixteen cards, twelve little windows, eight trinkets, seven big windows, six skinny windows, three staircase pieces, two medium windows, one bracelet, one spinning arrow, ♫ ♫and a partridge in a pear tree ♫ ♫.  BTW - Recommended age is 3 and up. (HA!)  Yeah, good luck keeping all of those pieces after a game or two.As for the rules, it's a two player game, so I already know my daughter is going to be Sophia and I'll be the ""Hider.""  There is no debating this.  From what I gather - and the instructions are somewhat convoluted for a 3 and up game - the Hider flips over a card, follows the instructions, and after all the cards are flipped over the number of trinkets (""charms"") on Sophia's bracelet determine her score.  After the players replace the trinkets, flip over the cards, and switch roles (haha, that ain't happening), the game is repeated.  Whoever has the most trinkets while being Sophia wins.I'm sure this game could be fun with an imaginative and interactive parent, but the complexity doesn't really jibe with a 3-year old.  Aside from that, Sophia the character is only present on the back of the flip-cards.  She's the selling point, right?  And good luck having your daughter be the Hider.  Hey Disney and Wonder Forge game, would it have killed you to even consider making the ""Hider"" someone else in the game?  You know, like Cedric the Magician?  After all, he's about the only consistent antagonist on the entire cartoon.  And, he's always trying to get Sophia's amulet.  Jeez.  A little imagination please.Overall, the theme song for Sophia the First does a good job of summing up the problems with this game:""Now I gotta figure out how to do it right,So much to learn and see""Maybe a bit too much figuring out, and bit too much to learn and see.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFEYDVYF1B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYD5JLW#wasThisHelpful","R3UFEYDVYF1B1","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With a bunch of loose ties from previous books to be resolved, there was a lot to accomplish with the Witch Wraith.  The trilogy started with a weakening Ellcrys allowing demons into the Four Lands, necessitating a quest by Arlingfant Elessedil to find the Bloodfire.  Meanwhile, the Ohmsford family reads like a soap opera, with one long lost relative being hunted down, another in deep trouble, and one caught somewhere in between.  Throw in a combination of impossible to remember character names meandering through a battle with a Federation intent on war - also on muddying the variety of subplots - and it's a difficult series.  It's even more difficult when other Shannara books have been read and a lot of this book's details feel like regurgitation of previous plot points and characters.  It's even worse when some of the plot devices get a complete 360 reboot (e.g. Druids, Ellcrys).This reads like most of Brooks' other work.  Pretty decent character development, usage of old bloodlines, coming-of-age youths (usually in aforementioned families) , descriptiveness that borders at times on fluff, increased inspiration during major confrontations/battles (or when describing the magic/supernatural), supporting characters dying like so many red shirts on Star Trek, and an ending that feels somewhat rushed.  If you've read the first two parts of the trilogy or are a big Brooks fan it's worth the read.  For the average reader, however, it's a bit disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FPLW41UXNN5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345523539#wasThisHelpful","R1FPLW41UXNN5K","A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"David Gordon writes a stylish, suspenseful, sublime crime/comedy (cromedy?) novel about struggling writer Sam Kornberg, his new gumshoe gig, and the struggling marriage to his wife LaLa in L.A.  When Sam's wife drops the ""we need to talk""-bomb on him, he finds an assistant detective job working for a bizarre agoraphobic Solar Lansky.  Think Ignatius J. Reilly with added weight and lessened sloth.  During his stakeouts, Sam finds himself increasingly drawn to the target, a beautiful woman that ultimately led to his employment.The majority of the book reads like a combination on the bizarro world stuff Tim Dorsey has made a career, and the list-centric, shocking stylings of Chuck Palahnuik. In fact, the copious references to literature and cinema are almost certainly the vibe Palahnuik was attempting in his disappointing Tell-All.  Which is to say, Gordon is a very gifted story-teller, a man capable of blending the seemingly incompatible into an enjoyable tale that refuses to be restrained or pigeonholed.  Where else will you read a single page that contains Nazis, taxidermy, a meteor shower, an orgasm, and the internet?!After reading The Serialist and being very impressed, I am now a firm believer.  Gordon has a gift, and he's on my short-list of contemporary authors.

"For folks interested in the noise level: It's quiet when not under load (obviously); when under full load there's a soft whine. About half as loud as one of the 3-fan 280X cards. The stock cooler is doing a great job at keeping the card cool. The room it's in is 25C and the card maintains 61C while under full load.For those interested in its mining capabilities: Believe it or not, from the angle of hash to watts, this is better than 280X or 290X cards. For days now I've been using this to hash at a stable 492kh, pulling only 175watts.

"For those interested in the cooler: The stock cooler on this is very nice, and does a much better job than any previous 79xx series card. At 100% it doesn't get as noisy as they used to, but it's still noisy. The MSI R9 280X has a nearly silent cooler which does a slightly better job at cooling. For both, I use an aftermarket cooler anyhow: Prolimatech MK 26, which is completely silent and cools better than stock.For those using it for mining:This is the most stable of the various brands of R9 280X series I've tried. It's also providing the most output. I get a stable 800kh+. I've tested it in cgminer 3.4.x and 3.7.x, runs flawlessly.800kh+ Settings:TC: 24000Engine: 1160Memory: 1800Intensity/Powertune: 20750+:TC: 24000Engine: 1050 or 1080 (some cards vary)Memory: 1500Intensity/Powertune: 20There is a tweaked cgminer scrypt kernel for the Tahiti chips out there which will net you 15-30kh more than usual in some cases, and I use this to help achieve extra speeds.

"This is a crazy awesome fan. I use these as well as its related cousin, the Blue Vortex 14, to cool a bunch of GPUs. These, like its cousin, are silent. Standing next to them you'd have to strain to hear them running--and that's in an otherwise silent room. They push almost 100CFM each too!These are ""half height"", and use 120mm thread holes, so keep that in mind.

"Having spent a lot of time researching GPU cooling, including talking to folks' who make it their hobby to try every single cooling option out there, and seeing the superb performance the Prolimatech Mk-26 gives.. I can, without a doubt, pronounce this one of the most amazing cooling solutions ever. I have the black and silver models and both perform equally. If you want to see my before/after results, skip down to the bottom.It's the most efficient GPU cooler you will find, and in 2 particular independant tests, performed better than off-the-shelf liquid cooling (Accelero Hybrid).As long as you have the physical space for this card (3 card slots without fans, 4 with, plus 2"" of clearance on top the card), this is truly a must have--for the enthusiast, the extreme overclocker (myself), or even the casual gamer.By design, it supports passive cooling for almost every GPU it can mount to, but it really shines when you add 2 140mm fans. The fact it's universal (fitting almost every current and future single-die graphics card) makes it even more valuable. My suggestion is to couple this card with two 140mm fans (I suggest the Prolimatech Blue Vortex 14, as it's the quietest of all 140mm fans I could find, while still providing the same airflow).So far I've installed 12 of these, and I have many more to install. I'm ordering these units by the crate where possible, and as they're available (from Amazon and other websites). They're really awesome!For those curious, installation time took me about an hour for the first card (went slow to figure out how best to do many of them), but the next 11 took about 2 hours, give or take. I did each step all at once which helped. Shouldn't take more than an hour for just one card for the average user.PROS:* Nearly universal - fits a wide assortment of GPUs, and will fit many in the future* It's a simple ""bolt-on"" solution - if you've changed GPU coolers in the past, it's not really any different* Superior cooling/thermal capacity - blows away the competition* Passive & Active design - You can use it with/without fans. Using the suggested fans, it's nearly silent* Includes everything you need, with plenty of thermal paste (I was able to use 1 tube for 3 GPUs)CONS:* This cooler is amazing because of its physical size - the card sticks about 2"" above the card. Without fans it sticks about 2.5"" beyond the side of the card, and another inch with fans. You will need a unique case, or open case or open air design to hold the cooler.* The instructions included aren't as detailed as they could be - the website includes very high quality/very detailed photos of general installation. Use the website and the included instructions together. For someone who has done this before, you probably will only need the paper instructions to tell you which GPU die adapter to use, the rest is self explanetory.NOTES:* Some folks noted installation difficulties, even multiple hours per change -- anyone experienced with cooler swapping shouldn't have many issues, but it will depend on the card design. I saved time (probably more than half an hour) by NOT removing the stock thermal plate from my GPU's, instead I added extra heatsinks on top of it. Remember, the more metal there is to soak up the heat, the better--just make sure you add heatsinks and the fan can blow on them to dissipate the heat.* With the fans, most of the hot air will be blown past the card (ie, away from the back of the card) instead of toward the rear or front of the card. So keep this in mind with your design.BACKSTORY:I run a small GPU farm and wanted to ensure longevity with my MSI 7950's by keeping temps low, and make it easier to cool them during summer. As a bonus, I wanted to lower the fan noise level as well. I spent a month researching and talking to people, narrowing my results to the Prolimatech MK 26 and the Accelero Hybrid. I had also considered making my own closed-loop cooler (like the Accelero Hybrid), but I wanted more of a bolt-on solution than having to take time to get the water block mounted to the GPU. Especially considering I'm doing racks of these conversions, and not just one or two cards.In the end, what sold me on the Prolimatech over the Accelero was it's future-usability (being nearly universal), and the fact there were fewer parts to fail. If the fans on the Prolimatech failed, the GPU would still be cooled (just not as well). If the Accelero pump failed, my GPU was dead. Also, as mentioned above, in several tests the Prolimatech and Accelero Hybrid were a dead-even match in noise level and cooling capability--in 2 particular tests the Prolimatech was quieter by 2 decibals.MY SETUP:* Multiple Racks of MSI TwinFrozr III 7950 GPU's, slightly overclocked. Each rack has 12 GPU's. Each GPU is scrypt-mining over 700kh/each. Each rack = 8,400mh/s* Running the TwinFrozr coolers at max RPM would keep the cards between 78-85*C with ambient air of 20-28*C* Noise level of each rack (12 cards) was equivalent to a 20"" box fan running on highMY RESULTS - With the Prolimatech MK 26 & two 140mm Prolimatech Vortex 14 fans @ 1,000rpm:* With ambient air of 20-28*C, the cards average in the mid 50*C range, with some in the mid to low 40's, and some in the low 60's. This variance is due to where the GPU is in the rack (near the floor, or near the ceiling)* I did a summer ""burn"" test by shutting off the air cooling system and letting the GPU's heat the room up. With ambient temperatures over 45*C, the GPU's remained between 55-65*C. Amazing!* Noise level for each rack is literally a whisper. I have to stand next to the rack and put my ear toward a fan just to hear it running. I would say, it's no louder than a desktop PSU fan.

"This is one of the 'chair' style floats I recently purchased to try out. I'll definitely be keeping this, it's really enjoyable.PROS:Easy setup, simply inflate the 4 different tubes (the 3 main ones, and the rectangular back support), and adjust the straps to suit your preference. The nylon seems tougher than some other products I've used in the past. I weigh around 250lbs, and this had no problem keeping me afloat similar to the product photos. I was able to use it in a reclining position and as a 'chair'. This can be deflated quickly and is very portable.Value:Overall this is a good value, but I can't say it's an amazing value. The product itself is awesome, but I believe it would be an even better value if it cost a little less, maybe low 20's or high teens.Other thoughts:If someone is having issues with this keeping their body afloat in the water, make sure your understanding of how it works is correct. The 3 main tubes will keep your body afloat. Don't expect to be sitting ""on top"" of the water surface. If you're pretty  much almost wholly sunk, I would advise ensuring the floats are fully inflated. At around 250, I was happily floating mid-waterline.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32O6875HRYXD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001ILKBE#wasThisHelpful","R32O6875HRYXD7","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had a good tube in years, a decade even, and when I saw this tube on prime for the cost of just 3 large coffee drinks, I couldn't pass it up--considering the numerous high ratings, and the clear quality of the product. I weigh around 250, and this has no problem keeping me up. I'm sure it could keep 2 of me up.PROS:The vinyl is thick feeling, and the design is top of the line. The 'back rest' portion inflates separately from the tube, allowing you the option of using it or not. The handles are in just the right spot and easy to grab, and it offers 2 average size cup holders which do a great job. The mesh netting is sturdy, and the inner hole is 'just the right size' for adults. You can easily paddle with your arms, or kick-off using your feet. The inflation orifice is a high quality screw-down device, guaranteed to not accidentally popoff.Other notes: The inflation orifice is about 5/8"" in diameter (eying it), and is meant for the 'hand' or 'foot' pump units, or anything with one of the larger inflation hoses. I didn't know this when I got it. I use the air system in my shop to inflate things like these, so I simply used a piece of vinyl tubing inserted into the orifice and connected to my air system, to inflate it quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQ5OKK1923CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PEOMC8#wasThisHelpful","ROQ5OKK1923CD","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"--Review has been updated, see below for details--Overall I am very pleased. The device will hold total water usage until you reset it. Keep note there is a 999 limit on the screen, at which point you have to reset it. It was spot-on accurate for garden hose usage, and within +/- 1% accuracy for large volumes (1,400+ gallons at once). It is water resistant, though I would not let the device get rained on.[Original Review:]I've seen some mixed reviews on this product, but I needed a quick way to measure how much water I'm using on my pool top-offs. The instructions are good enough. Basically you remove the cardboard 'tag' inserted in the meter, which activates the battery, and it should be good to go.I grabbed a 5 gallon bucket where the 5gal mark was clearly marked, and hooked this up to my hose. I ran it several times, and each time the water hit the 5gal mark, the meter read precisely 5.0. Each time the water level was the same, which shows consistency.The instructions mention a +/-10% error rate, which should be fine for most applications. For large volume, such as thousands of gallons on my pool, I'll also be using some volume calculations on the pool itself using a measure of fill height to see just how close the meter is to my manual math.I will post up my results after.Regarding waterproofness, I saw some folks say it conked out when it got wet. The battery compartment has a rubber oring to prevent corrosion, and the display appears to have one as well. Once I'm done with the item, I will disassemble it to determine actual weatherability, and report back.[2013/05/13 Updates:]As promised I'm providing more feedback on this product. I used this to keep track of the gallons used for my frequent pool top-off, and to see how accurate it is, I also used some math based on the inches of water added to the pool, to provide a volume calculation for gallons added. I also opened the device up to see what waterproofing methods were in use, if any, as some had mentioned theirs died when it got too wet.Regarding Accuracy:The instructions mention the device is accurate to within +/- 10%. As mentioned previously, I found it spot-on accurate when testing with 5 gallon buckets. For my pool, I was pleased with the accuracy level as well.As I found out on accident, the device only counts up to 999.9 gallons, and when it reaches this point it stops counting. This happened while filling the pool. I had been checking on it frequently and kept track of the time elapsed and the total count, every 20 minutes, but at some point forgot to check and I came back to see it reading 999. Quickly hit the reset button and it continued counting up once again. I was getting about 7.5 gallons per minute of flow into my pool, so that point where it hit its limit could have only been at most about 150gallons unmeasured. So I noted this.After the pool was finished filling, the meter had registered 1360 gallons. This is up to 150gallons shy of what may have gone in, due to me not realizing it had hit 999 and stopped counting. Knowing the area of the pool I was able to then measure the fill height in inches, and derive a volumetric total of gallons added, which came to 1490 gallons.So the math shows 1490, the meter showed ~ 1510 (1360 on the meter plus about 150 unaccounted for). This is certainly within 10% accuracy mentioned on the instructions, it's actually about 1%.I would say this is an accurate unit, and am pleased with the price paid.Regarding Waterproofness:I took the device apart and have added a photo of what I found to the product images. I outlined a rectangle in pink to highlight the epoxy being used to seal the electronics portion of the device. You can see some moisture in the casing which is to be expected, but the epoxy is very well done.I didn't take it apart further as I didn't want to disturb the epoxy. My theory is if the device is dying due to getting soaked, the LCD cover may not be wholly waterproof, allowing water to seep in and mess things up. I wouldn't use this device in the rain, nor leave it uncovered in the elements, but I wouldn't feel bad about some moisture getting on it every now and then.I definitely wouldn't connect it to a garden sprayer as they show in the instructions, as they sometimes drip a lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GDK4HPO53XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QRLAQ2#wasThisHelpful","R3GDK4HPO53XK","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not much else to say about the cable. The price, quality and fast shipping were all perfect. Definitely keep in mind if you need this type of cable.On a technical note, remember that the max length of a DVI cable is dependant upon the equipment providing the signal. Expect at least 15' as a guarantee for most electronics, though some provide a strong enough signal for up to 30'-50'. The same goes for HDMI, the maximum length is dictated by signal attenuation and the gauge of the wiring, but expect at least 15' for sure.DVI doesn't support audio, so don't expect audio to work through the cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354EZKX4H8ZYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HDJY7K#wasThisHelpful","R354EZKX4H8ZYO","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was out of USB3 headers on my motherboard but still had a USB3 front port which I wanted to plug in somewhere, so after some searching I saw this and jumped on it for the price (under 20 at the time of this review). This board includes a USB3 header as well as the 2 external rear USB3 ports.The short of the story is this board solved my need and installation was a snap, drivers only took a minute to install. This is an awesome value, and it's a low profile card which is awesome. It also includes a small/short profile rear backplane cover in case you're putting this in a tiny/short ITX box.Installation was a breeze. I didn't install the drivers beforehand, I installed the board and booted the system up. My XP Pro install recognized the card but had an older driver for it, so it came up in System Hardware as unable to start. I checked their website and looked at the available drivers. Strangely enough the drivers available to download were older than the ones included on the CD you find in the box--that's rare. I used the drivers from the CD, simply running the setup program.After that I deleted the reference to the hardware (a Jmicro/Jmicron device) from System Devices and rebooted the system. I did this particular step because sometimes XP won't pick up a new driver despite being told so, and this will force it to rescan available drivers.Sure enough once I rebooted, it picked the new driver up and the board worked immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8IH543Q29Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SJGGAE#wasThisHelpful","R3O8IH543Q29Z7","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I needed to mount a 19"" Dell LCD to the side of a workbench, allowing me to swivel the monitor, swing the arm in/out, and some amount of tilting upward/downward. This was the perfect solution.The Dell was not a VESA-mount compliant monitor, so I had to do some drilling to make it fit, but that was expected and has nothing to do with the mount, I just have an old monitor.I didn't use the lag bolts included so I can't comment on other's experiences of it being difficult to use them, as I used some bolts to secure the mount to the workbench.Once everything was mounted up, I used the included small wrench to adjust how tight the arms and pivot joint were, to my liking. Everything is working like a charm.The tilting up/down works well, but didn't provide as much tilt as I had imagined.

"I needed a bar-styel USB hub which was compact, it needed to be inexpensive, and allow for external power--and this was the one for me. It doesn't require an external power adapter, but for my purposes I needed one (several USB devices requiring more power to be plugged into this). It didn't include a 5v power adapter, but I had one which fit perfectly.I don't have the power port measurements offhand, but it was the super thin style, instead of the classic ""M"" plug.The switches enable/disable their respective USB port, so you could have a device plugged into the port but the computer can't use it unless you turn the switch 'on'. If the switch is on, the blue led lights up. The light works regardless of external power or not.Be advised, you cannot use high-power USB devices (such as external drives), or a bunch of the ports all at once, without the external power. Most USB ports do not provide more than 500ma of current, and that will be split across all 7 of these ports equally (500 / 7 = 71ma).

"I bought this product, but not through Amazon. I wanted to get the product ""just for the heck of it"", but due to the mixed reviews I didn't want to spend what it  was listed for here. I found it elsewhere for about 30% less. You'll see in my photos it's the same product.OVERALL:* Rating: 3.5 / 5 - ""I like it, but it has some quirks, namely the noise""* Installation Time: ~30 minutes by yourself* Difficulty: Low* Quality: 3.5 / 5* Value: 4 / 5 for what I paid, 3 / 5 if I had to pay moreThis was a purchase for the whizz-bang factor. I have a dual sink in the master bathroom, one side is 'hers' one side is mine. The sink has really nice, expensive faucets, but just for the heck of it I decided I wanted something different. I looked around for something cheap, and found this. The mixed reviews made me cautious enough to want to find it cheaper elsewhere, so if it was a total loss I wasn't out so much. This is clearly a ""made in a China factory in bulk with recylced metal"" product, but it does function nicely and is definitely worth keeping.My installation instructions/sugggestions are at the very bottom. The next few paragraphs describe the contents of the box and the quality of the materials and the couple of quirks I found. I cover topics such as the leaky hoses and the noisey faucet, so please read.Here's what the colors of the faucet mean:Blue - Cold: anywhere from freezing cold to just plain coldGreen - Warm: lukewarm to very comfortably warmRed - Hot: this is what most people consider to be the high end of comfortable 'hot' waterFlashing Red - Super Hot: hot enough to where you can only keep your hand under the water for 2 seconds, on up to scalding hotA side benefit to something like this is you could teach kids not to use the water if it's Red. Red = hot = pain.INSIDE THE BOX:The faucet was wrapped safely in protective wrapping material. It included the hoses, mounting hardware (2 studs, 2 nuts, a mounting plate, some gaskets), the battery box and batteries. It also included instructions. Here's the first quirk: The instructions were for a completely different faucet. This didn't bother me because I wasn't going to use them anyhow, this is a straightforward faucet install.The faucet and its contents were secured nicely, there was no visible damage at all. 5/5 for packaging.THE HOSES:Some people expressed issues with their hoses. Either the oring gaskets were the wrong size, or they didn't fit the existing plumbing, or there were leaks. I examined my hoses closely, and the oring was the proper size for the hose and the faucet. I inspected the ports in the faucet where the hoses go. The faucet is made out of copper, plated in a nice chrome finish. The ports are just raw copper.The copper threaded ports where the hoses go were pretty clean, but I did wipe them out just to be safe. However, where the oring mates and compresses for a watertight seal, didn't seem perfectly round. I wonder if this is why some people had issues. You could put thicker orings on the hose to overcome this, but what I did was wrap the hose threads 3x with teflon tape, to help provide additional sealing. You can see this in my pictures.The other end of the hose, which goes to your plumbing, was the ""new"" American standard pipe size, and the hoses included the built-in rubber sealing gasket. I say new because some older homes may have a different size, which is why some people need an adapter or a different valve. My plumbing was newer, so the hoses fit without issue.The hoses felt like I could crush them with my fingers, which at one point I did on accident. I wouldn't advise using much force when handling these. For overall hose design and quality, I would say 4/5.THE FAUCET QUALITY:You know this came from a China factory, made in bulk. The chrome plating is perfect, but the bottom of the faucet where you install the hoses and the mounting hardware, is pretty rough. You can't see this rough, so don't worry. The threads for the mounting studs were threaded slightly at an angle, almost as if by hand instead of a machine. The base plate is thin enough where you could bend it to correct if you wanted to, but I left well enough alone. The handle looks really sharp, as does the neck of the faucet. The looks of the faucet are outstanding.I will point out a couple of things which bother ""detail oriented"" folks like myself. The handle was mounted ""slightly"" crooked in relation to the glass of the faucet. It's about 1-2 degrees of a difference. I didn't want to try and correct it and accidentally break some water seal, so I left well enough alone, but it does appear you could fix it if you needed to.The other thing to point out is the quality of the cut on the glass. 3 layers of glass are laminated together to make the faucet, and a machine cuts the glass to make the water channel. The cut is very rough and not polished. All other portions of the glass *are* polished, as you can see in my photos, just not the edges of the water channel. This will only bother you if you stare closely at it. Functionally it still works, but it will cause some of the water to ""favor"" the outer edges of the flow channel.Overall, 3.5 for the faucet itself. I take away half a star due to the 2 oddities I mention.INSTALLATION HARDWARE:The 2 studs and nuts are fine, that's fortunate. The gaskets were entirely useless to me, with the exception of the large round one. It looks like it will fit the bottom of the faucet, but it doesn't. At least, mine didn't. I did use it, however, to go beneath the hole cover. This way water around the sink can't leak into the hole under the plate. It also helps prevent the plate from bending too much when you tighten the faucet down.2/5 for this.FAUCET FUNCTIONALITY AND NOISE:I did not have any leaks with the hoses or any connections. 24 hours later, still no leaks, so for now I'm calling it ""good"". The faucet functions beautifully, it doesn't leak or anything. For all intents and purposes, it's great.The only catch is.. the faucet *does* make some noise. If you turn it on so it's just slowly coming out, it's about the same noise level as a usual faucet. If you turn it on all the way, it's about the same noise level as any other faucet which is on all the way.Anything between ""on full blast"" and ""slow gentle stream"", you'll be left with a faucet which is louder than most. I would say, twice as loud, as I perceive it. It's not enough that you can't hold a conversation in the bathroom, but it is loud enough that it makes you think your garden  hose is set to ""jet blast away"".3/5 for the sound.INSTALLATION AND SUGGESTIONS:Tool-wise all I needed was an adjustable wrench, the small kind. For added watertight sealing, I also used some Teflon tape and a synthetic grease. Here's a quick breakdown of what I did:* I put teflon tape on the hose threads. I did this by wrapping it 3x, and using a razor to cut the excess so the tape was only on the threads.* I put a thin film of synthetic grease (any will work, synthetic will prevent the orings from drying out/cracking or being damaged) on the orings, so they slide into place without any friction, keeping them from damage* I saw the hole of my sink was *just* slightly too small to accomodate the hoses and mounting hardware. My hole was 1.25"" in diameter. As you can see in my picture, I used a dremel to provide some extra room at the ""corners"" of the hole. I used a plastic cup to catch the material as I grinded it away. Use a breathing mask btw.* I installed the hoses into the faucet. I tightened them by hand until they were snug, gripping the hoses at their base (not the hose itself). Then I snugged them a little firmer by hand. You can use pliers or a wrench for this, but don't over tighten--the orings provide the water seal, it's not a matter of how hard you tighten the hose.* I installed the hole cover plate (LightInTheBox Bathroom Vessel Vanity Sink Faucet 4"" Hole Cover Deck Plate) onto the faucet. It took a little wiggling to get over the hoses, but it worked. Once the plate was on, I screwed the studs into place. I checked the fit with the metal mounting plate and all was well, see my picture.* I set the faucet into place, and used the mounting plate and 1 nut to loosely hold the faucet in place while I installed the hoses* I installed the hoses to my plumbing. Remember, with the faucet facing you, the hose on the left is the ""hot"", so attach it accordingly to your plumbing.* When tightening the hose to your plumbing, first do it by hand as much as you can, and then use a wrench to ""firmly snug"" the connection. The rubber gasket provides the seal, you don't need to use brute force. Too much force will cut the gasket.* I turned the water valves on to check for leaks. First, I let it sit for a few minutes to check leaks at the valves, all along the hoses, and up to the faucet. There were none. I then cycled the faucet several times, and checked for more leaks. I let it sit for about 5 minutes and checked again. You want to check for leaks like this before mounting and tightening the faucet down all the way.* I installed the battery pack and mounted it. For me, I have it mounted to the drain pipe, it's out of the way of any potential leaks, but still easy to reach.  If you mount it with the screws facing down, away from any potential leaks, there's no way water can get in the compartment. With the batteries installed, I ensured the LEDs light up, and they did.* Once I determined it was leak free, I lined the faucet and plate up, and fully mounted it in place. I used a wrench to ""snug"" the nuts, I did not make them ""firm"", just a smidge more than hand snug. Enough so the faucet won't move out of place, but not so much that it crushes anything.* I checked for more leaks later on, and there were none. I considered the project complete.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRUJR88QFAKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CCU99Y#wasThisHelpful","R1WRUJR88QFAKI","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed to mount a center channel to my wall, and wanted a subtle mount which wasn't very apparent to the eyes. I thought about making one myself since it is a simple task, but I ran across this mount and decided to try it out. I've been really pleased with this over the past couple of months, it's solid as a rock with the wall anchors I bought locally (not the ones included).Short and sweet, the PROS:* Price - it was right where I was comfortable spending for the product* Looks - it's subtle, a soft black, and the design keeps it mostly out of sight* Simplicity - A couple of screws for each leg, and you're doneCONS:* The included wall anchors are larger than the norm, but not what I'd want to use for the job. They won't clamp well on older or crumbly dry wall. Many products these days have this issue, it's usually not the fault of the manufacturer, because they can't foresee every style of wall their product is being used on. I usually end up buying heavy duty wall anchors for all of my wall-related projects, because my drywall is very crumbly. I reccommend a nice wall anchor in my comments below.Other notes:* Because of the design, the legs of the mount angle downward slightly--ever so slightly. I haven't measured it yet, but I'd say less than 10* just by eyeing it. Heavier speakers will increase that effect, and it will be a bit more pronounced if you extend the legs.* Make sure to have a level handy, it makes life easierREGARDING ANCHORING:First, for this or any product which needs a wall anchor, and you need to make SURE it is a solid anchor, grab some of these: Toggle Anchors (available from Amazon and most hardware stores) - http://www.amazon.com/Toggler-Toggle-FF-B-588-D-Specifications-Threads/dp/B00AH28GMA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354565777&sr=8-1&keywords=drywall+snap+anchorIt uses a nice piece of steel to lock securely against the inside of the wall, and they're rated for high loads. Super easy to install! I used them on this wall mount. Unlike many wall anchors which simply rely on pressure from installation, or a small plastic nipple on the inside of the wall, these things really lock into place!A couple of reviewers apparently had issues with their speaker mount--either they got a bad unit from the manufacturer, or they misunderstand how these items work--as some ""came out of the wall"" or ""broke"" from putting weight on them. Although every person will have varying experiences with a product, something to note is that a speaker mount like this is only meant for a certain amount of weight, and how well it is anchored to the wall is even more important than the weight rating. If it is poorly or inadequately anchored, it will fail as a result of the anchor.Even if anchored properly, one shouldn't lean their body on the speaker mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MJEYN4FL3WGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MP5JX4#wasThisHelpful","R3MJEYN4FL3WGC","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"USAGE:I'm part of a group of about 30 people who all use these, typically all on the same channel. At times we're spread throughout the woods, usually in varying terrain (hills/mountains/thick woods/brush), and sometimes flat-lands.. areas as large as 120 acres. We've been using these radios for over a year now with scarcely an issue with being able to hear each-other loud and clear.They are secure, reliable, and easy to use!I'll keep my review short, because there's lots of folks who've exhaustingly posted up about these radios. I'd give these a 10 if I could, instead I can only give a 5/5!PROS:* Too many good things to mention!* Outperforms standard FRS systems - Our group uses them in mixed terrain, flatlands to mountains to trenches, heavy woods.. 50..70..120 acres, no issue* Secure, unlike standard FRS--even secure against the same model radio, thanks to encryption* Private and Public channels, IE you can address everyone on the same line, or you can address a specific radio* You can tx/rx text messages if you like, to all, a group, or individuals* The kit includes everything you need to get started, including some basic headsets* The radios will accept higher-end headsets!* Can use alkaline batteries, excellent for when the rechargables die* There is a cloning feature built into the radios, so you can clone the settings and the addressbook, or just the settings. This is great if you have particular settings/channels you need to program into say, 50 radios at once, like our group! Set one radio up, and clone the rest off of it!* You won't find a better deal on license-free radios, for this price range, ANYWHERE. We have folks in our group who deal in the radio business, and at wholesale pricing, and for the under $80 range for a whole setup, you can't beat these* Amazon Prime has had the best price on these for awhile, I got mine for $67 shipped. That's less than $38 per radio, including headset and batteryCONS:* If I had to list a con, I'd say some folks don't like the included headset because it pinches their ears* Some folks don't like the rechargable batteries because they don't last a solid 8 hours* NOT WATERPROOF BY ANY STRETCH, not even water-resistant! That's one thing most of my other FRS radios can claim: being water proof. These are not. I've had to take a couple apart to get grease and other stuff out from under the keypad. So ensure you keep these in a pouch of some sort, or under your clothing!SYNCH ISSUES:A few years back, this model radio had re-synch issues.. no longer!BATTERIES:Half of us use the rechargable batteries, the rest of us use alkalines. The rechargables will work for about 4-6 hours of constant use, depending on weather variables. Alkaline batteries tend to last a full 8 hours.You'll know when your stuff is dying, because the incoming transmissions seem to go into slow-motion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7SCRA1PQ4H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KZW65C#wasThisHelpful","R3K7SCRA1PQ4H1","A34C9AFFZOI45T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34C9AFFZOI45T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've purchased several of these this year and last year, and keep coming back for more. They're simple, inexpensive, and work wonders. The design is thinner than some other cables, which has its own special benefits.With a much thinner design, you can more easily bend the cable, or allow it to fit into tight spaces, without too much worry. For instance, I have other brands of fiber cable, some of them 2-3x thicker, and they were not able to fit behind a TV of a recent install I did, without putting too much stress on the neck of the cable going into the port.These thinner ones were perfect, they fit right in, and don't have any issues with a tighter bend.

"I have a Galaxy S5, and all my problems with it were related to the Amazon Music Player.  It swallowed up my internal memory and really messed with the phone operation.  So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory.  It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it.  They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps.  You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card.  But it doesn't always work.  It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs.  While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure.  I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do.  So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can't seem to get it right.  Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory.

"I have had the S5 for a year now, I bought very fast not knowing the differences.  First of all I have compared this phone to everything out there, but I didn't know to compare it to the S5 models that are available.  Here is the reason for two stars, It would be Five Stars if it had more than 16GB internal memory.  I only have a few apps, I bought a 64 GB mini SD Card for music and photo storage not realizing it will take up 128 GB card.  Go ahead and get the 128 mini SD card (External Memory).  The phone wants to update software (internal Memory) as it needs to, but it says not enough space on internal memory.  So I started checking out the problem because again I don't have that many apps., what I discovered was I should have bought or held out for the 32 or 64 GB internal memory model that some carriers don't carry yet. Search it out, the phone is awesome, but is really memory starved.Having said all this, it's the best phone I ever had.  Never has froze up and runs fast still.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WWOE38UZZX1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ1XJ3Q#wasThisHelpful","R2WWOE38UZZX1L","A29X0TZCFQDRZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29X0TZCFQDRZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Starting with three sets of tarot cards that someone sent anonymously the witches use their special gifts to try to uncover a reason that Alaina might have runaway.

"The best of a series I love. Lexi's newest case has her rethinking working on her own as a private investigator. The case she has taken on is so complex that she is taking the victim's word that she is being stalked; no one else believes it. Calling on all her resources, even her dad, Lexi is determined to prove that Juliet has a stalker who is so subtle and intelligent that even Juliet doubts her sanity some times. It turns out that she is not the only one interested in the case even though she is the only one who is trying to help Juliet; Solomon has been hired to determine is Juliet has violated laws covering illegal trading. My heart went out to Juliet and her fiancee because the situation seemed so impossible but I had faith that Lexi would find a way to get to the bottom of the problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWP6EWKT1RBWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141GRGUK#wasThisHelpful","RWP6EWKT1RBWI","A2FGLRWU445AQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FGLRWU445AQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That may sound funny considering that the main character gets shot and the relationship between her and her super hot fiancee is strained but there is so much humor that it keeps the balance of mystery, danger, and heat from totally boiling over.

"Lizbeth Selvig is an amazing author. Rescued by a Stranger is the fourth of her books I have read since discovering her recently, and I have loved everyone of them. One of the things that I enjoy way the fact that she weaves realistic community issues into each book, keeping us tied to the rich characters of the town as well as fascinated by our magnificent main characters.  Magnificent they are, however, they are not perfect. It is their weaknesses as well as their strengths that let us really see the characters as well as providing interesting background for conflicts in the relationships.Jill Carpenter is attend vet school during the year and works as a riding instructor/veterinary assistant in the summer and training as an Olympic hopeful.

"Harper always felt that she fell short in meeting everyone's expectations, especially those of her father.  Now just when her professional life to take a major leap forward, the man she thought would live forever has died of a heart attack, and she has returned to the family ranch that she loves for his funeral. Mired in the pain of his loss and knowing that she will never have another chance to earn his respect, she is bowled over to discover that the family is close to losing the ranch.  The only warmth that she can feel is her reaction to her lifelong friend Cole, but she can't turn to him the way she has always wanted to because he had a long time relationship with her sister, and sisters don't date each other's exes, a philosophy that Cole refuses to understand or accept.  As disaster after disaster strikes, Harper is pulled by her love of the ranch on one hand and her need to succeed in her career as an artist on the other.Without Ms Selvig's amazing finesse in creating her character, Harper could easily have turned into a narrow, petty, or obsessed character, instead the reader is compelled to admire, enjoy, and just plain like the young artist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N0HBSZUTE1ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLVDH9W#wasThisHelpful","R2N0HBSZUTE1ZZ","A2FGLRWU445AQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FGLRWU445AQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Replaced the OEM sway bar on my 2000 Tundra 4WD because two snapped on me due to a defect (like a saw had cut 1/3 through). Unquestionably stronger and stiffer than the OEM bar but now the next weakest link fails. I do a lot of off-roading and this super stiff bar punishes the sway bar links and end grommets. I've broken maybe a half-dozen links. Some cheap ones from eBay only lasted 20-miles off road. The ACDelco links go about a year. I just installed a Moog link, definitely stouter but only time will tell if it'll last longer. As to the grommets, cheap OEM ones last a month or two, then they just disappear.

"My review is limited to topo maps, with over 1000 road reviews there's nothing I can add.I'm upgrading from a 6YO Nuvi 205W, it lacks almost all of the bells and whistles of the 2757, but it did a good job displaying topo maps. Reading these reviews I was lead to believe that only road maps work in the 2757. Took my microSD with Above the Timber topos of CO & UT. Inserted the card into the slot. Turned on the 2757, browsed to the MyMaps page and it showed City Navigator, CO, & UT. Turned CN off, it'll display over topos, and moved from Chicago to UT using the base map. Zoomed in and viola, 24K topo maps.I've uploaded a screenshot of Arches NP. You can clearly see the road, hiking trail, selected arches and 40-foot contours. That my friends is the essence of a topo map.I won't take the 2757 in the field, too big. However that 7"" screen will be a delight to preview a hike in my camper the evening before.Update June `15:Took the 2757 to Utah arch hunting. Drove 70+ miles on dirt and 4WD roads, the 2757 was mounted to the windshield using the supplied Garmin suction mount. That mount was so good the GPS never budged or vibrated the entire trip. I could see arch icons at the 1.2 mile scale giving me 10-miles of map to view. That allowed me to plan my stops for the closest starting point for each hike based on the contour lines . . . awesome. The main dirt road was on the CN maps and the spur 4WD roads were on the topo maps so navigation was a breeze.Puzzled by the battery charging. The mini-USB into the mount block will not charge the battery, it would only charge via the micro-USB port into the body. Why then does the mini-USB port exist?Update Sept `15:The 2757 supports AnyName.img in addition to gmapsupp.img for map files. Now you can break your topo maps into logical units instead of having one giant gmapsupp.img file. This is the first Nuvi I've encountered that supported AnyName.img, all handheld Garmin's have done so for many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32S7AHJPYPQBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXX0I6A#wasThisHelpful","R32S7AHJPYPQBU","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:- Half the price of TT basic- Opens MUCH faster than TT, and starts at your tax file- All the Forms- Data entry straight forward- Linked data from all forms to 1040- Forms button on top bar- PDF import- Modest learning curve- All files on my HDDCons:- Wanted to load at C:\ not C:\Program Files\- Had to register to open the software- State nag each time I opened the programLike all TT users I was appalled at Intuits money grab for 2014. For 30 years I'd been a TT user buying the basic version because it had all the forms I needed (1040, B, C & E), roughly $80 now on TT. I never use the Q&A format, simply wanted the forms and the internal links from each form to appropriate 1040 lines. At the end I run the audit check and file my paper return. I always have to pay, so I include the check with the return.TaxAct has all the features of TT, just slightly different and a bit of a learning curve. The most notable difference was the form(s) for expanded data for a single entry. TT tended to have custom sub-forms whereas TA used a single generic form for all entries.The PDF import was straight forward, with 20-20 hindsight I might have imported the massive form set instead of just the return to file. There were no import errors, just a few missing pieces. The alert review found missing data, so no big deal. Both TT & TA start in brain dead Q&A mode but in TA the Forms button was right at the top, TT required you to drill down.The C: load was contrary to any software in the last 10-years, even had a nag discouraging using Program Files, I did anyway, works fine. Never had a piece of software that I had to register before I could run it. The state nag was a noticeable bother, should have had a ""Don't show this again"" field.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15RLHKK4CFG96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S76XZ7E#wasThisHelpful","R15RLHKK4CFG96","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not the same as the OEM heads. MUCH better!!!I kept purchasing new shavers on sale because they were cheaper than replacement heads. Little did I realize that the HQ8 combs are made differently than the OEM combs on the 7310 shaver. If you look closely at the photo, you'll see that the HQ8 combs have both standard slots AND small holes. The comb is keyed to the frame such that all the holes are in the interior with the slots on the outside. The OEM combs were all slots, no small holes.Bottom line, these HQ8 heads shave twice as close in half the time as the OEM heads. Can't say if the small holes are the reason or if the HQ8 heads are simply better, but they are a vast improvement over the OEM heads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRANTM7DL54SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068PBT#wasThisHelpful","RRANTM7DL54SH","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:Cuts a 2x6, noticeable effort requiredAfter cutting ~100"" of 2x6, blade still sharpCons:Hard to follow a straight cut line, too much dustI needed to make 2-dozen stepped 9-12 pitch gutter blocks. Didn't own nor want to purchase a table or radial arm saw for the job. I first tried the coarse tooth blade in a variety pack of blades, couldn't get even an inch with great effort . . . hopeless. Got these because of the incredible reviews for the Bosch shank version: Bosch T234X Progressor Wood Blade (5-Pack), I needed U-shank blades for a Skil jigsaw. Found the Bosch P/N on HD then used that P/N to search Amazon to order, Amazon searches are always a bit hit or miss.Because the blade tended to wander, I fabricated a 9-12 pitch guide which I clamped to the 2x6, I pressed the jigsaw shoe against the guide. I used my thumb on the back of the jigsaw to force the blade into the wood. Took about 2-min for each 4"" cut. The wander likely means this blade is good for scroll cutting.If you ever used a SAK saw, then you know that the blade has no kerf/set, rather all the blade detail is within the blade thickness. Each tooth is intricately shaped and razor sharp, with right and left alternating teeth, not at all apparent from the product illustration. Not surprisingly, these blades were Made in Switzerland.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLN0GYQO4BOBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q2W9JW#wasThisHelpful","RLN0GYQO4BOBP","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The DCD771 is a detuned version of the classic Dewalt 2-speed, 1/2"" chuck, VSR drill. Bigger, heavier, slower, less power, lower capacity batteries, slower charger, soft case, no belt or bit holder. Built to a price point of $99 on sale. Great for the once a month DIYer, not an everyday contractor tool.The closest contractor grade version of this drill kit is the DEWALT DCD780C2 20-Volt Max Li-Ion Compact 1.5 Ah Drill/Driver Kit which is $200+ shipped. Potentially double the price if you can find the 771 on sale.More detailed comparison of DCD771 and DCD780:- Lot longer (8.7″ vs. 7.5″)- Heavier (3.6 lbs vs 3.4 lbs)- Less powerful (300 UWO vs. 350 UWO)- Slower (0-450/0-1500 RPM vs. 0-600/0-2000 RPM)- Two 1.3Ah vs. 1.5Ah batteries- Slower non-temperature compensating charger (60 mins vs. 30 mins)- Contractor bag instead of a hard plastic case- No belt clip, bit holder or bit, but a place for both- Drill, battery & charger Made in China vs Assembled in USA from International partsBATTERIES & CHARGER:The Li-Ion 20V batteries have multiple cells which can individually drift, the charger can correct for this drift under known conditions: temperature. The 771 charger can only accurately charge the batteries when both the battery and charger are between 65 and 75 F. Whereas the included charger for the 780 has a cold/hot delay to compensate for cold/hot batteries. Charging outside the 65-75 temperature window will shorten the battery life, by how much?, that's the $64K question. For a homeowner, the 65-75 restriction is no big deal, for a contractor time is money. The 771 charger has two keyed holes on 4"" centers to hang it on a wall. Cord appears to be 6-foot long.DRILL PERFORMANCE:The 771 arrived 12-2, charged the battery until the charger stopped flashing. Chucked a Torx T-30 bit and it took 50-sec to drive and remove a 5/16 x 4"" Lag Screw into a pine log three times, color me impressed. My 30 YO B&D 3/8"" 120V VSR drill managed to get the same screw halfway in before it stalled. In fairness to the B&D drill, shifting the 771 to high and it also stalled. It was almost dark and the LED light was almost blinding. Stayed on for a least 10-sec after the switch was released.The bag is spacious, was able to get both drills inside. The drill is very stout, you can tell there is steel inside. The entire back and handle is grippy rubber, the black. This may be a low dollar Dewalt, but it definitely isn't cheap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280SSML22XBM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET5VMTU#wasThisHelpful","R280SSML22XBM8","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quality screwdriver has a ball on the end that presses into your palm to apply downward force to the screw, just like the product picture shows. That not what you get!!! Instead the end is simply rounded and the flutes cut into your palm when you press down.

"A Torx deck screw is as significant an improvement over Phillips as Phillips was over slotted screws. I just finished installing custom 9-12 pitch gutter blocks using these screws and compared to the same size Phillips head screws the lack of frustration and increased drive torque was priceless.

"The DVR 612 is my third Dish DVR going back over 10-years. First had the original 501 which went 9-years and I got a letter from Dish saying it was obsolete. Dish replaced it with a used DVR 512, which had a squeaky fan that I replaced. It lasted 2-years before the HDD failed. Got the VIP 612 on ebay for ~$70 as a refurbished unit still in a sealed anti-static bag. The 612 pros and cons compared to the 512:Pros:- HDMI output to an HDTV- 20.1 remote with a Format button with four aspect ratio options- USB output option to external HDD- No fan noise after the first minute of power on- Bigger HDD so more recording hours- Big bright record (red) and on (green) lights, could barely see 512 LEDsCons:- Power hog, 38 watts just plugged into the wall- Skip forward audio anomaly- Slow to acquire satellitesAll three Dish DVRs are power hogs, the 612 is the worst, roughly 25% more than the 512. The 612 uses 38 watts plugged into the wall, 39 watts turned on and 40 watts recording, shame on Dish, that's more daily electricity than a refrigerator. I'm solar electric so I have an inline switch to save my batteries. But the satellite acquisition time is 3 times as long as the 512 or I'll get unviewable recordings if I don't power-on at least 15-min before the record time. The 512 could be powered on at anytime and it would start the record as soon as the satellites were aquired with no record defects.The audio anomaly happens after skipping forward on recorded programs, takes the audio ~2 sec to settle after the last skip, neither the 501 or 512 had this ""feature"".The Format button on the 20.1 remote is particularly useful. Some broadcasters send SD in standard 4:3 format, whereas others use 16:9. The 4-options on the remote allow a screen filling view without clipping. The same button on the HD TV remote either didn't fill the screen or clipped some of the image. Both stretch SD content, but clipping is a bigger issue. I haven't upgraded my antenna yet to receive the HD satellite, so still dealing with SD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM42B9FFVTG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00147GCLY#wasThisHelpful","R2RM42B9FFVTG9","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

USB wrist BP monitors are very rare or very expensive. I'm comparing it to a Prevention USB BPM I got from Woot some years ago. I measure my BP using both units and get similar results, not identical. The Ion tends to give a little lower readings.With the Ion and the Prevention I can get 2-months of daily readings before recharging the AAA batteries.Overall the Ion software is easier to use, more intuitive than the Prevention software, but so far the BP graph is less dramatic. You can set High/Low ranges and the software will report the number/percentage of events in/out of range. My doctor was particularly pleased with this report, more so than the graphs.The Prevention BPM has long been off the market and I predict the same fate for the Ion brand when these sell through.Five stars for the price, if $50-$100 for a USB BPM then 3-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GRF8O694P97K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057WWZMM#wasThisHelpful","R1GRF8O694P97K","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:- Removes ash powder from glass- No foul smellCons:- Very expensive for what is does- Will NOT remove the translucent white filmI bought a bottle of this 15 years ago when I got my first wood stove. I had no clue how to run a wood stove. After a few weeks it became clear, run her hot. Initially I'd try to throttle the damper, that only produced black soot everywhere. I run my stove a minimum of 200 days per year and the damper now has only two positions: wide open or closed when cold. I usually clean the glass every time I empty the ashes, about once a week.Over the years a persistent translucent white film has developed and I've tried toothpaste, ash paste, and this product. All make a dent but none removes it completely. I followed the directions and used a Teflon kitchen sponge with heavy pressure. The film is so thin and well bonded it has a rainbow near the edges.For weekly cleaning, Windex and a paper towel removes the white ash powder as well as anything.FWIW, the active ingredient is Sodium Hydroxide.If anyone knows how to remove the translucent white film, please post a comment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TEMK4D10EA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UC5BBG#wasThisHelpful","R23TEMK4D10EA5","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this mouse until it had a flat tire!Intermittently I would experience so much drag on the scroll wheel that it would barely turn. This usually happened in the morning after extended hours of non use. Today I was having troubles and the entire rubber outer rim had pulled away from the wheel. It was like the rubber rim was several millimeters larger than the wheel. How could this happen???Today I ordered a new Logitech mouse, I'll limp along until it arrives.Edit Nov 2013: FIXED FLAT TIRETook the mouse apart, need a Torx T-6, and gently removed the snap in wheel assembly, broke the three tiny plastic welds, and using a small round file created a number of concave pockets on the outer rim of the wheel.

"Pros:- Breathable upper fabric- Light weight- Rubber boot strap, not a cord- Elastic calf shock cord with retained spring clamp- Price for all black ~$8 less than the colorsCons:- Would not stay up on calf- Zipper starts at the bottom- Black- When cold/wet the boot strap slips out of the ladder buckle- Which is right/left?I put these on at the house, drove 25-miles to the trail, hiked 4-hours in 2-6"" of snow and they were never hot, either in the car or while hiking. That and  the cuffs of my cotton denims weren't even damp, that's impressive.I'm 6'-1"" with a 34"" inseam but the calf shock cord would not hold up the size large gaiters, seems they needed to be a couple inches taller.  They did not droop to my ankles because the front zipper and Velcro is so stiff, it propped up the fabric.My last pair of gaiters had the zipper start at the top, I'm convinced that's a much better solution. In almost every other respect these are far superior.The rubber boot strap threads through a ladder buckle for retention and adjustment, this works very well when dry and at room temperatures. Not so well when wet and cold. Several times I've had the strap come loose and be flapping. I solved this by putting a small safety pin through the strap.The product photo is so small and dark both on Amazon and Outdoor Designs, I was in the ""dark"" as to the features of these gaiter. However, the many positive reviews swayed me. I posted a photo with notes to help others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB9TFDJ4VNF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G6MK3M#wasThisHelpful","R2GB9TFDJ4VNF7","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:- Thick, one piece leather uppers- Solid bonding of sole to upper- Comfortable, No Break-in needed- Color = Dirt- Good traction in snow, rock and gravel- Laces that stay tight- True to size- Nice padded collar- Price, about the same as a resole- Metal, not plastic, lace hooksCons:- No steel foot-bed, too flexible- One tongue not centered- Soft rubber sole collects cactus- Not waterproofSince I received these in late July I've put over 200-miles on them in 4-12 mile day hikes. Most hikes have been on trails, but a few off trail on steep side slopes and talus. Both off trail uses highlight the weakness of these boots. The lack of a steel foot-bed makes the sole too flexible for comfortable off trail hiking on steep terrain.The cactus con was a surprise. For miles around my house small prickly pear are common and with leather uppers and Vibram soles I just ignored the cactus. My first hike with these and the soles were filled with a combination of needles and crushed cactus pedals. Basically the sole rubber is too soft to reject the needles, unlike a hard rubber Vibram sole.The Timberland website claims waterproof, not what I experienced. Took a 4-mile,4-hour hike in 2"" of snow where the boot toes were frequently dusted with snow, when I got home my socks were damp. Never experienced that with my Gore-Tex boots.I'm only mildly disappointed with these boots, they have limitations and I'll need to use them where they are best suited.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21TD718MIASHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VX6Y42#wasThisHelpful","R21TD718MIASHM","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The biggest challenge was reinstalling the push-rod which goes from this handle to the latch mechanism. That push-rod isn't retained by the latch, so once removed finding its proper hole is entirely by braille. Then the plastic retainer was inserted backward into the new handle lever, it wasn't until I examined the old handle that I realized the problem.

"Pros:- Holds the tanks securelyCons:- The heavy steel strap fatigues and breaks at the spot weld- Hard to compress and engage the cinch boltI have this same rack in my RV, until it failed it held the tank securely. The heavy gauge loop strap (~1/16"") is just mild steel, not spring steel. The ends need to be spread apart about one foot to get the tank inside the loop. Doing so causes the steel to bend, not flex, at the spot weld. After so many bend cycles it fatigues and breaks.This same bending makes getting the bolt through the two ends very difficult, especially starting the nut while holding the two ends together.Perhaps this rack was designed to have the tank inserted vertically, not possible in my RV.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30GYLPTK2AN1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VAUQFA#wasThisHelpful","R30GYLPTK2AN1V","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Replaced the Denso OEM plugs in my Tundra after ~84,000 miles, they were working fine. Checked the gaps from one bank, all were between 0.047-0.050"", about 50% over spec.These Russian made Bosch plugs reeked quality. Hard to get excited about a spark plug, but everything about these said well made. Plating, ceramic, fit and finish were top notch.The gap spec is 0.032"" and I checked all of them. In all cases a 0.030"" wire passed through and a 0.032"" wire just entered the gap. Close enough since the ground strap was 50% thicker then the Denso plug and I would not have been able to bend it.The engine fired right up with no misfire.

"Fairly straight forward replacement once I figured how the groove in the pads mated with the carrier. The carrier accepts the braking force, not the caliper. The pads were made in India, that's different.The new pads had copper threads in the matrix, in a ceramic pad??? Did a search, to be expected. Okay :)The braking performance was excellent after the new pads and rear brake adjustment.Some tips:- Put a container under the master cylinder, then use a C-clamp to compress the caliper piston.- If you're replacing the front pads, then for sure your rear brake shoes are out of adjustment, may be worn too. Remove the drum and turn the star wheel until the drum just fits.

"Pros:- Nicely made 3/8 drive, 5/8"" 6 pt impact socket- Very readable size markingsCons:- Spark plug falls out when held vertical- The display gadget broke off inside the 3/8 squareA spark plug socket MUST hold a spark plug in any position or it fails. The product had an elastomer deep inside the socket so an attempt was made, but the first plug I inserted fell into my lap. Better there than the engine bay.To display on a peg board it had a 3/8 plastic square molding inserted into the socket. When I tried to remove it, the gizmo snapped off, leaving the square socket full of plastic. Had the socket retained a spark plug I would have been only a bit perturbed and drilled out the plastic.So if you're looking for an extra long 5/8"" x 3/8 drive impact socket, this may be it.

"My only real complaint about this saw is that a simple wing-nut is an insufficient clamp to prevent blade rotation on the push stroke. Even though all folding saws are only intended to cut on the pull stroke, some drag will occur on the push stroke. Particularly when cutting green wood.I used this saw cutting three 4"" Dia logs the other day during trail clearing. Two were dry and even pithy and even on those I experienced some slippage/rotation at the wing nut clamp. The third was more than a year down, so semi-dry, and the drag in the kerf was so severe that every push stroke caused blade rotation.My solution! Drill a hole in the blade, add another 10-24 x 1-1/4 carriage bolt and wing nut to prevent rotation. See photo.You may think that removing that screw from its storage location and inserting it through the blade is a lot of extra work, but given the effort to saw a log, it will be time well spent. Besides, the way I have it configured, you need not use the second screw unless/until the blade starts rotating.Basically, Flexrake needs to incorporate this or another solid anti-rotation solution to make this a finished product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E4MRWF2PSW8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OBZGJQ#wasThisHelpful","R3E4MRWF2PSW8O","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- 2"" Capacity- Light Weight- Reasonable Cost- Compound Cutter, Less Effort- Easily SharpenedCons:- Compound Cutter, More Distance to Open- No Rubber StopI bought this lopper exclusively for trail maintenance a few times per year. That maintenance consists of 90% willows with the balance conifer limbs and Potentilla. Willows grow as a multi-stem cone from knee high to over head high and quickly obscure a trail if not pruned back periodically. The goal is to cut the willow within 6"" of the root. To do that a long reach is needed and the compound mechanism reduces the force required.The AL 4110 is the least expensive of the ~40 lopper models that Corona makes. However it is not cheaply made, just design compromises to reduce cost. All the steel parts: cutter, hook, link bar were heavy gauge steel stampings with nice tight joints.I used this lopper for 8-hours over two days cutting 1000's of willows from 1/8"" up to 1-1/2"" Dia. If I could get the cutter/hook around the willow stem, then the cutting effort required was always trivial. By comparison, I have an old single pivot lopper, cutting the largest stems required every ounce of strength I had.If a cut wasn't clean, a small uncut ribbon, then sharpening was required. I sharpened the cutter perhaps a half-dozen times in the two days using one of these Corona Clipper AC 8300 Sharpening Tool, fast and easy. The same compound mechanism that makes cutting so easy puts a lot of stress on the cutting edge, causing the edge to dull.Even though the AL 4110 lacks a rubber stop, I never felt a jarring close. Perhaps because willows cut so easily or it is just inherent in the compound mechanism?I considered one of the highly rated Fiskars PowerGear loppers, but if you watch their video, they need to be opened 180, that's best suited for waist high cutting. For willows, the best cutting position is sitting on  the dry ground. For that position, the 90-120° opening of the AL 4110 is a better fit, see attached photos.1 Year Update:I've now trimmed over 10,000 willow and spruce branches, no I didn't count. Occasionally, the tool will bind from grit getting between the cutter and hook. Disassembly (4 identical 1/2"" nuts) and simple cleaning and works like new. After all that use, held it to a bright light, no gap between the cutter and hook.Was on a backpack into a NM wilderness, met a USFS trail crew with a 5-foot long 2-man handsaw, they had this same lopper as part of their kit.The combination of light weight, long reach and powerful cutting action makes this lopper an ideal trail trimmer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL95NOCJUXTD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GIO0QQ#wasThisHelpful","RL95NOCJUXTD7","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Very heavy suede leather- No weak stitches- Very long cuff- PriceCons:- Hot to wearIn my experience work gloves fail at the seams before the leather wears through. I used a pair of these for trail maintenance, clearing willows with a lopper and using a pick to divert water off the trail. Used them for 8-hours over 2-days and they showed no signs of seam failure. I had no blister or other sores so the gloves did their job of protecting my city hands.I was working in 60-70° temps and after an hour I couldn't wait to get these gloves off to allow my hands to cool and dry off.

"I had no idea what I was getting when I ordered this hair trimmer/cutter. Basically ordered it for the low price and the Norelco name.

"Pros:- Blade Locks Open & Closed- Large Rubber Grip- Low Cost- Knuckle GuardCons:- Heavy and Large- No set to the teethI got this as a packable saw for trail work to use instead of my 14"" non-folding hand saw. Its 30% heavier but the blade fits inside the knuckle guard when closed.The saw is 4.5 x 11.5 inches closed, weighs 13.2 oz and the blade is 9.5"" long. Everything you see in red is a rubber material for a slip free grip. The blade is quite thick and the teeth have no set.I've done two trail clearing projects since receiving the saw, this is what I've learned. The lack of set to the teeth is a major problem for dry wood over 4"" Dia and green wood over 3"" Dia. When cutting larger wood, the chips fail to clear the center teeth during each back/forth stroke. Then the saw binds in the cut and it no longer moves. To continue, you have to fully remove the blade from the cut with each pull stroke, not very efficient.When I ordered, the same saw was offered by several Amazon vendors, I choose the cheapest, BuyDBest at $8.23. Amazon has a huge selection of folding saws, wade in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KXCV63DHLS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AMD3RG#wasThisHelpful","R11KXCV63DHLS9","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Thermometer- Three independent burners- Tool Storage- Easy propane tank attachment- Price- Excellent customer serviceCons:- Structurally deficient, see photo- Cosmetic damage- Defective Ignitor, not true see edit *I started looking for a new gas grill late summer 2011. I had problems with ground squirrels getting into my grill and tools. All I could find at various big boxes were monster contraptions costing many 100's of $$$. So when the 463722311, catchy model name, showed up on one of the bargain sites for $94 shipped, I jumped on it.THE GRILL:Fundamentally this is a very solid gas grill with flaws in design of the support frame and numerous quality issues getting a perfect product to the customer. The basic gas grill was preassembled and it slid into the frame you assembled from the many parts using a well-illustrated manual. Both the top and bottom of the firebox were heavy gauge steel shells. The burners, tent flame shields, upper wire shelf and grill racks are then inserted inside the shells, all exhibiting a been there - done that before professionalism. All the steel pieces were coated in porcelain, easy to clean and durable. I've yet to fully master all the subtleties of grilling on the 463722311, but I'm convinced that with the thermometer and 3-burners it won't take me long.* Since I started using the 463722311 2-months ago I've grilled steaks, chicken, brats and burgers at least twice each and the combination of the three independent burners and the thermometer allows  repeatable control. Some things just need fast grilling whereas other need baking. I always grill in the center with a single grate, this allows me to move the grilled item over the flame tent, away from direct flame. I then adjust the outer burners for the interior temperature. Easier to do than explain.BBQ** Before I got this grill I was clueless how to BBQ, I only grilled. BBQ is grilling first, then baking to finish. For BBQ three burners and a thermometer are crucial, I cook in the center and leave that burner off for baking, use the other two burners for temp control. BBQ has tripled my menu options and I now use the grill ~100 times per year. Surprisingly easy on propane, maybe three bottles per year.STRUCTURE:The frame that supports the firebox lacked basic structural elements to prevent parallelogram collapse on the right side. A simple triangular brace is all that would be required. Instead, Char-Broil wasted three pieces of wire to exclude a propane tank from being placed under the firebox. Any of those three wires could have braced the frame from collapse. I added a steel strap, crude but functional, see photo.DAMAGE:The grill had numerous dents, dings and bends in many of the thin gauge steel parts. The worst dent was in the upper firebox shell. It had a large dent from the inside out. It's as if someone took a ball peen hammer with full force struck the shell. The dent fractured the porcelain coating inside and out. In addition, the control panel was heavily scuffed in the right corner leaving a thumb size area with the paint removed. Everything was well packaged in cardboard and/or Styrofoam. The outer carton had almost no damage when it arrived. None of the packaging material showed any damage. All this leads me to believe that the damage occurred prior to shipment and were packaged that way by Char-Broil.IGNITOR:The piezo crystal push button ignitor didn't work. I saw one blue spark in one hundred attempts. I used the interactive PDF ignition questionnaire and ended up at the 800 number. I called customer service and except for the accessory up selling the process was smooth and painless. New ignitor should arrive in a week. Installing it into the tight space above the gas manifold will be non-trivial.* After receiving the replacement ignitor which also didn't work, I figured out the problem. I assumed that the ignitor had two parallel circuits for the side and main burners . . . wrong. The two electrodes are in series. By not installing the side burner, I defeated the ignitor function, I should have grounded the side burner wire to the frame.MORE:While the 463722311 has no designed in tool storage, I had no need for a side burner, so I converted that compartment into tool storage, see photo. I purchased a 1/8"" pipe plug to block the gas port for the side burner. The propane tank has a hook and v-notch attachment over the axle, quick and simple.I deducted 2 stars for the defective ignitor, weak structure and all the damage. The 463722311 could have easily earned 5 stars except for those problems. My spell checker likes igniter, but Char-Broil spells it ignitor in their manual?*Edit 2-15-12 I bumped my rating one star.**Edit 7-8-14 Added BBQ paragraph","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCXIFY4THEY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J6DIO6#wasThisHelpful","R2HCXIFY4THEY3","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Price, I paid $399- My Dish remote did basic controls (On/Off, Volume, Mute)- Vibrant LCD colors and contrast- Color presets or individually adjustable settings- Matte screen- Low power (74 watts)- Easily attached external speakers- Useful manual- Great image via HDMI from Bluray, DVD or Xbox- Good composite image from my DVR- Power brickCons:- Terrible speakers- Slow start up, ~5-10 seconds- No auto recognition of aspect ratio- Power brickI got this from my local Small Box a couple of days before BF, so I've had it about 5-weeks. I had been considering the LG 47"" 3D bundle, but virtually no 3D content and half the price from a local store and I bit on this in spite of the many low reviews.At first I had weird color patterns, orange bands in the green grass, watching football. The manual's troubleshooting section suggested it was a composite cable problem. Checked the cable, too much strain causing the connector to be skewed, fixed that and not seen the problem in 4-weeks.The power brick is a double edge sword, another block to deal with, but OTOH possible to have no cables attached to the TV when moving, not even a power cord. Speaking of power, I measured 74 watts when on, less than 1 watt off. That's about as good as it gets with any 42"" LED LCD TV.As to speakers, instead of a $100+ sound bar, I opted for a pair of computer speakers, I had 3-pair laying around. One problem, computer speakers have a single 1/8"" (3.5mm) plug whereas all TV's have RCA jacks. To quickly convert you need this inexpensive part from Amazon: ""2 x RCA Male / 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable, 6 inch"". Radio Shack does not carry an equivalent part, bah humbug. I ordered two and give the second to my local Radio Shack.One other step in the speaker situation, you need to disconnect the TV's internal speakers, else their terrible distorted sound will add to whatever external speaker you select. If you simply turn off the internal speakers with the menu command, you no longer have volume control with your remote. You'll need an A/V receiver or some other solution. To disconnect the internal speakers, I disassembled the TV cabinet and posted photos.I have this sitting in a corner next to and almost touching two large windows, the matte screen and LCD image combine to make for a very viewable picture in the middle of the day.This TV does not auto recognize the aspect ratio of TV content, don't know if this is possible, sure would be nice. Perhaps if I get a HDMI DVR then this will be a non-issue. Currently I scroll through 4 settings on the remote to select the best aspect ratio for the content I'm viewing. In the grand scheme of things not a big issue.Overall I'm very pleased and if it dies in a year I'll only be out $400, OTOH if it lives 5-years it'll be a great bargain.

"Pros:- Records two SD programs at once and allows me to watch any prerecorded program while recording, including either of the two being recorded.- Improved menus and overall operation vs the DVR 501- Essentially faultless recording in the 4-months I've had it.Cons:- Power hog, 33-35 watts just plugged into the wall, on, off or recording- The 4"" HDD fan squealed, I replaced it with a computer case fan- Very old, full of dust, the 200GB HDD was made by Maxtor (they've been gone for years)- No HDMI socket for HDTV- Can't handle Daylight Savings Time, all programing is an hour off, delete and reprogramI've been a DVR junkie for almost 10-years, I time shift 95% of everything I watch. My DVR 501 had been acting up for 6-months and then I got a letter from Dish saying it was obsolete and would need to be replaced in the next year. I called Dish the next day and asked why wait, they said how about tomorrow.The only bad part was I now incur a $6/mo DVR fee which starts in one year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXP1V25E57QB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FF2INO#wasThisHelpful","RXP1V25E57QB8","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:24 MinsI've not done any video editing in about 10 years, so I was starting from scratch. Other than understand a timeline, I had no clue how VSPX4 worked. It took me about 4 hours to create the attached video. That included loading VSPX4 (20 min), and finding several still photos and crop them to 640x480, the same as my base avi file.I started with a 10-min avi video and used it multiple times with different start and end points. Then I added numerous text elements which were added to the parallel text timeline. I did numerous previews to see how all the elements interacted. The attached video is composed of the avi file plus three jpeg photos for a total of 84 seconds. I did all this without ever opening the manual, just hovered over the tools to read the tool tips.The only hard part was figuring out the output format. Tried a avi 640x480, took 20 min to render and it was lousy. Then tried wmv at 320x240, took 1 min and it is the attached file.I did not find a help link in the main menu, surprising for a Corel product. My only real complaint is that the text timeline did not stay attached to the video timeline. So if you insert and/or change the length of video clip, all the downstream text elements no longer relate to the correct clip. Quite possibly I need to learn by reading the manual. ;)So by my standards, this is easy to learn and I'm looking forward to adding to my skill set with more projects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KL304KLIQXOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PIPG2A#wasThisHelpful","R2KL304KLIQXOB","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a newbie to the world of high cocoa chocolate bars. I got one of these at my local grocery for $2, amazed they'd carry such a high end product, it's a very small store. My only previous purchase was a box of Chocolove 77% bars from Amazon. I've consumed one of a dozen bars.In comparing the two products, the only significant difference is the noticeable aftertaste of the Lindt bar which was not present with the Chocolove product. I'm talking several hours later after I'd brushed my teeth and gone to bed, still an aftertaste.Otherwise, both were very smooth with a rich chocolate taste. I chased the Lindt bar with a couple of dark Hershey kisses, amazing how sweet a Hershey kiss is after eating some high cocoa chocolate.Two other observations:1- A 3.5 ounce bar is huge. One bar is good for at least three servings for me. YMMV.2- The Lindt bar had a sealed foil wrapper, whereas the Chocolove bar had a folded paper and foil cover with no real seal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E10UWE313IUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HQNBSU#wasThisHelpful","R2E10UWE313IUD","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Good Sunlight Readability- Dynamic Distance and Bearing- Works with Above the Timber Topos- Very Accurate Position & Altitude- High Resolution Display- Ability to Color and Save Tracks- Touchscreen Interface- Easy Text Entry- AA Batteries- User Text Block at Start up- User Background- Many ways to Display Trip Info- Create a Screenshot of Anything- 0 or 2 or 4 Semi-transparent Data Fields on top of the map- Custom Profiles to Retain Unique Settings- Excellent GeoTagging integration with BaseCampCons:- Odometer Inaccurate, Greatly Improved w/ 3.90- Low Battery Life- Imprecise Touch Position- Most Elevation Fields not displayed on Trip ScreenThis is my fourth Garmin GPS (it's a disease) and for my outdoor hiking interest this is so far the best. For my needs no GPS is worth a pinch of salt except for the internal maps, knowing my coordinate location on planet earth is of no value. However, having an accurate map inside gives that location context and in doing so exceeds the sum of its parts. As I move, the GPS instantly centers the map around my position and I can quickly zoom in/out for more detail or area.Of secondary interest are the GPS' whistles & bells such as various time, distance, elevation and waypoint fields. I like and use all of these as it satisfies my inner geek. Unfortunately, you cannot put all possible fields on a single screen. The max/min elevation values can only be displayed on the elevation profile screen, not the main trip screen. Also, a date field is not available on either of the two data screens, hence you cannot create a single screen to record relevant data with the trip date. I record a screenshot of the trip data and a date field would make it a complete trip snapshot.Since I've gotten the 450 in mid-Sept., I've taken 4 hikes from 4 - 11 miles, in all case the trip odometer has been off from 20-50% low relative to the same trip distance as recorded by the track log. I also compared the odometer to a Garmin Colorado and its odometer was within 2% of the track log. I'm running the latest firmware 3.80, doing my odometer comparison. Update, Garmin's latest firmware release 3.90, greatly improves the odometer accuracy to where it is low about 2%.A feature of the 450, common to most Garmin handhelds, but missing from the Colorado, is Dynamic Distance & Bearing. With DD&B you can place a marker anywhere on the map and the GPS will instantly calculate the distance and bearing from your current position. It's dynamic because as you move those two values are always updated. That marker also becomes the center of reference for subsequent zooming actions. Problematic with this is using the touchscreen to place the marker accurately, be prepared for some frustration.Sunlight screen visibility is a key criteria of any outdoor GPS unit. Unlike a Nuvi where the screen is almost useless in direct sun, the 450's screen visibility is improved by direct sun . . . the brighter the better. While not as bright as the same resolution Colo screen and certainly less snappy than an eTrex, the 450's screen is none the less very readable in the field.My favorite 24K Topo maps are published by Above the Timber and they work faultlessly in the 450. You can read my map comparison in another review.Started doing GeoTagging of photos using BaseCamp, awesome! A icon for each photo appears on the map in BaseCamp, clicking any icon brings up a photo viewer. You can then click through the photos and the map will stay in sync. It gets better, transfer those same photos back to the Oregon 450, and view them in map context inside the Oregon. Kudos Garmin. BTW, you must record a track log while taking your photos.Users can open a file (startup.txt) on the 450 in a text editor (Notepad) and add up to 5 lines x 30 char each to identify ownership. This text will display at startup. In a similar fashion, user backgrounds can be created/saved as JPEGs to display behind most of the data screens. I went with mostly white to enhance overall visibility.I'm getting roughly 10-hours from a pair of Eneloops, below my expectations. The good news, the 450 beeped, it displayed a low battery screen, I stopped, opened the case and inserted my spare AA's. Easy!!! The battery life can be greatly increased (~75%) by having the display time out after 30 sec.A leading reviewer dismissed the accuracy of the altimeter, not my experience. I find I need to calibrate the altimeter at start of a trip/hike, a simple procedure of grabbing the nearest contour value and inputting into the calibrate field. That gives the barometric altimeter a reference. From that point forward the GPS altimeter continually updates the elevation in its auto calibrate mode. I'm rarely off more +/- 20 feet from known elevations, an order of magnitude better than any watch/handheld altimeter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NDH1NYA5ZAKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00313JX4W#wasThisHelpful","R2NDH1NYA5ZAKA","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Much less Heal Pain- Cost less the $10- Easy InstallCons:- None YetFor the last year I've been experiencing heal pain after long hikes (greater than 5 miles). I've tried softer socks and a different brand of gel insoles. Better but still some pain the next day. I selected these at a walk up display at a local big box because they were on sale.The night before a long hike I got out my hiking boots and adjusted the insoles and put these on top. Just a little scissor work to shorten for my boots. The next morning I left for what would be an 11-mile hike with 2700-feet of elevation gain and decent. On past hikes a 10-min rest would have my heals so sore I could barely walk, didn't happen. The next morning I had no significant pain when walking.It is my belief that the waffle pattern is as much responsible as is the gel material. What ever the reason, I'll soon be buying another pair for my other hiking boots.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZROQBEERRVM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00130G7IA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZROQBEERRVM8","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:* Amazing value* Single sheet feeder* Brain dead easy setup* Large finger recesses, bottom center, for lifting the big fella* Sharp text* ToolboxFX Utility* Compact footprint* USB & Ethernet* Nice organic shapeCons:* Dreadful case color choices, gray & black* Small paper tray, ~100 sheets* No custom paper size* Unreadable displayI got this to replace my 15-YO HP LasetJet 4P (Parallel Port) which was still performing like new. The 1518 was a re-certified unit for $125 delivered, amazing value! The 1518 is a little faster than the 4P for the first page, much faster for all subsequent pages. I'd been using a HP PhotoSmart AIO for my color printing, I'll still use it for CD printing. However, text printing on the 1518 is so much crisper that I can't go back. Still adjusting to the color difference, the ToolboxFX utility easily adjusts CMYK colors, but knowing which way to adjust is a work in progress for me. I tried the M -2, Y -1, as one reviewer suggested, it was not an improvement over the default. I ended up at M +1, Y -1 for the maps I print.The high cost per page for toner is a non-issue for me, but the priority single sheet feeder was a must, I print ~100 UPS adhesive labels per year. Having this caliber of printer for $125, more than justifies the high cost toner. HP has to make a profit somehow. Besides, Amazon has good deals on toner.The case colors make the 1518 look like death warmed over compared to the PhotoSmart's mostly beige case with the same gray. My LJ 4P held 1/2 ream of paper, so surprised at such a small tray on the 1518, particularly for a network printer. The good news, the paper tray is a breeze to remove and add paper.In addition to the adhesive UPS labels, I print my bank deposit slips on a 3.5 x 8.5"" sheet of paper from an Excel spreadsheet. The 1518 does not have a custom paper size option and because it center feeds odd sizes, I could not just print on the left side of a letter sheet like I did on the LJ 4P. I ended up selecting a #10 envelope and marking the case for the position of the centering wings of the single sheet slot.The 1518 has a small 2-line alphanumeric LCD display that is all but unreadable for me. I have the printer sitting on a small table 6"" off the floor slid part way under the modesty panel of my desk. The combination of the display glare and lack of backlight makes the display worthless. I can only read it if I bend over with my head below the desktop, then it always says: Language - English. The good news, trouble messages pop-up on the PC monitor, so not sure that LCD has any value for anything?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RPBG4010TZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00168RF6C#wasThisHelpful","R25RPBG4010TZ1","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was cheaper for me to buy this case and use an existing ATX 80+ PSU than to get a 80+ mATX PSU. One reviewer mentioned getting a modular PSU, I'd have to agree, the Antec Earthwatts I used has long cables and they fill the case.Bit of chicken and egg mounting the PSU and connecting the cables, the PSU wires quickly obscure the front panel connectors on the MB, but you have to have the front off to mount the PSU.The FDD clips barely connected to my short card reader, so I drilled out the clip and used a screw to attach each clip to the reader.I mounted a 3.5 to 2.5 HDD adapter into the front cable port, the ribbon cables had no problem fitting through the gaps but it blocked the power cable, so I rerouted the power cable, see photo. Perfect screw alignment for a 3.5"" HDD if you're inclined.The adhesive feet are very grippy opposite the adhesive, so much so that as I slid the case under the coffee table, all four feet pulled loose from the case. I had to lift and drop to position the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273MDLKCA2IIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TUYTZ2#wasThisHelpful","R273MDLKCA2IIA","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not many cases in this class accept full height PCI cards. Because I'm doing a low power Clarkdale build, the lack of cooling was not a problem for me. I gave blood once while checking out the 80mm fan housing, so not totally free of sharp edges.The Athenatech website has some excellent product photos to help understand all the features. While the product photo shows this case on end, I'm at a loss how you could use a tray load ODD in that position.  Theirs a weird spring loaded ""door"" on the left side of the front, not clear its exact purpose? I mounted a 3.5 to 2 X 2.5-Inch Bay Converter into one of the HDD trays so I could use a notebook HDD.I'd paid $20 more for this case if it would of included a 200W, 80+ PSU.

"This is a great case not only for the chainsaw, but lots of extras. I have a Husqvarna 455 Rancher with a 20"" bar. In addition to the saw, it can easily store a combo face shield and ear muffs, plus chain file and bar wrench, roll of paper towels and more. Their are molded recesses for holding many of the tools, even a spark plug holder.The bar shield is molded such that it locks to the side with a tongue and groove and when the drop down front cover is closed, it pinches the shield firmly in place. The drop down front has a locking groove it snaps into when closed. Very clever design.I particularly like the square shape vs. the form fitted cases. It fits perfectly behind the left wheel well of my S10 long bed, with the bar next to the wheel. When I'm done cutting I'll box up the saw and place the box behind the wheel well. The loaded wood them keeps everything snug. The case is strong enough to have loaded wood on top and pressing the sides.The only minor quibble I have is with the Velcro saw retainer strap, bit of a hassle to strap and unstrap. However, I've not figured out a better way. This case not only protects your chainsaw, it also protects you from the sharp chain and dusty chainsaw.

"Pros:Very close and comfortable shaveExcellent sideburn trimmerGood battery lifeCharge completed flashing LED'sPrice is right if . . .Cons:No battery status indication, none expectedTacky colorsI've been shaving for over forty years, mostly electric and mostly Norelco. For 3-months I had a Remington R450, see my review, huge dissapointment. Every couple of years Norelco tries to come up with a new gimmick to get us to purchase the latest and greatest. Thing is that Norelco got it right 30-years ago. The cutters and combs in the 7310 are the essence of that technology and if you can spin the cutters you'll have a close shave. All the other Whistles & Bells are just fluff.Norelco claims 10 days of cordless shaving on a 8-hour charge. The charge full indicator started flashing at 2-hours, done. I went 9-days and wondered how much longer, on the tenth day the motor started slowing down and it quit halfway through the eleventh day. By stretching the battery after the first charge/discharge I was able to get 12-days, well actually 11.9-days, could have used another minute of shaving. I stretch a NiCd by running the battery dead with the cutters flipped open for the lowest motor load. Pretty impressive for a single AA NiCd battery.People claim this is a good/great budget shaver. Nonsense, this is a excellent cordless shaver that can be had at a budget price. I got mine from the big W for thirty-one to my PO Box. It came in the full retail blister pack. By the time I got it to my house, 8500-feet, I thought it was going to explode. I saw at least two retailers have it for a bit less on Black Friday. Makes you wonder what the models that cost 4-5 times as much have to offer?So why is it ugly? Well of course beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this old eye doesn't do black and white on a shaver, all black . . sure, all white . . probably not, all silver like my deceased 7865XL's . . YES!!! I still gave the 7310 5-stars, I don't see the colors while shaving. BTW, I do like the white power switch.If you look at the photos I posted, you'll see that the 7310 consists of a small waterproof power module encased in four cosmetic shells. It's these shells that allow Norelco to play the silly color games at no additional cost. The sides even have rubber bonded to the shell. Turns out I shave with my thumb between the power switch and head and my fingers over the trimmer, so I don't even feel the ""slip proof"" rubber.

I was expecting high torque from a 19.2V drill, not to be. I tried driving some 1/4"" X 6"" lag bolts into pine and they barely moved. In fairness, my 30-YO B&D corded 3/8"" VSR Drill was none to thrilled with the lag bolts either, but it did drive them all the way. The All Power did drill many holes in the same pine with a 7/8"" spade bit.All the Torx bits are a huge bonus for me inasmuch as large deck screws are now Torx drive. I'd much rather drive a screw than pound a nail for most any project.The is in no way a professional tool nor was I expecting great things. I'll use it once a month and be happy that it's all in one case. I dinged the rating one star because of the cons, none major but in total one star.Edit Nov, 2013, after using a number of the tools, they are weak or brittle. Example: the included phillips/flat bit snapped off after a few uses. The second long #2 phillips got through 10 screws before the flutes rounded and it was useless. Almost no torque, I couldn't bury a single The Hillman Group 47850 Star Drive 1000 Hour Deck Screw, 9 x 3-Inch in a soft pine 2x4. I have a 15-YO 12V drill that had no problems driving multiple of the same screw.

"Pros:PriceClose shaveNose hair trimmerCons:High pitched whineUnder-poweredTwin button head releaseCrappy On/Off buttonNo charge indicatorLow Run TimeMarginal Sideburn TrimmerI've been a Norelco user most of the last forty years, I've watched as they progressed from solid functional razors to expensive gimmicky razors. Those expensive gimmicks caused me to try this Remington knockoff of a basic Norelco design. The R450 was cheaper than a set of new Norelco replacement cutters.Two things struck me about the R450 from the get-go,1) the sharp whine of the motor vs the purr of a Norelco and2) the motor was under-powered, it would noticeably slow when all three cutters were engaged on the side of my face. Then I came home from a backpack with a 3-day growth and the motor literally stopped while shaving under my chin, ouch! Never had a Norelco stop if it were charged.The 2-button release latch is another pain, theirs no spring to pop open the head and pushing both buttons and hooking a fingernail under the head all at the same time is difficult at best. A Norelco uses a single button opposite the hinge and it has a spring, simplicity!!!The on/off button is surprisingly difficult to find/press lacking just the most basic raised area to locate, you have to visually find the spot and press. A charge remaining indicator is a nice basic shaver feature, not on the R450.After ~16 hours of charging I got 8-days of shaves before it pooped out, significantly below my expectations and their claims. The sideburn trimmer was marginal, seeming to jam when I tried to define a straight bottom.The single AA powered nose hair trimmer was an unexpected bonus, seems to work too.After using this product for 3-months I came to dread my morning shave and ordered a Norelco 7310, only 20% more expensive but an order-of-magnitude better shaver. The slowness, motor stalls and the feel of the combs against my face all contributed to my dread. Yes the R450 is capable of giving a close shave, but getting there was not pleasant for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZRIOU2JBGJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q6RHHM#wasThisHelpful","R1GZRIOU2JBGJ3","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:Route-able Roads and Trails24K Topo DetailCons:Dark Colors and Poor ContrastMissing TrailsTrails aren't namedNo BLM or State LandsMy comments are limited to Colorado and I'm comparing the Garmin maps to another 24K topo set by Above the Timber. On a recent 3-day backpack I used the Above the Timber maps 95% of the time, Garmin 5%, readability was the key. The good news, both map sets reside inside my Garmin GPS and switching is a breeze.In my opinion a 24K Topo is a back country map used for foot, horse or other slow travel. This map set combines the excellent route-able Navteq highways and also route-able trails, that's slick. However due to an overly dark set of color choices, it's very difficult to see the trails to make an intelligent trip and/or route selection. Having the routing engine choose your route based on time or distance misses the human dynamic of most scenic. Not seen a routing engine that knows my scenic values . . . it'll happen someday.The Garmin maps do not show BLM or state lands, a very big deal in Colorado. Also the trails lack either names and/or numbers, kind of like having a highway map w/o names or numbers, huh? Names and/or numbers give you valuable clues as to where you're going, which you verify with occasional sign posts.To understand my colors and contrast comment, you'll have to view the attached Nuvi screenshots. They're fuzzy, the Amazon import did that and I'm not sure why.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20TTN5FBBY4P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RYK0JE#wasThisHelpful","R20TTN5FBBY4P0","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:Incredibly handy hydrationHigh quality materials and workmanshipCons:Mild chemical (plastic) tasteFabric cover attached to bladder not removableNo bite valve coverI got one of these to put in my older backpack which didn't have a hydration pocket. I put it closest to my back and I opened a seam to get the hose to the front. Unless your going to attach this outside the pack, all the fabric and buckles are unnecessary added weight.I have two Camelbak bladders, both have a mild chemical taste which I'd as soon live without. I emailed Camelbak, they replied in an hour (Wow) with a canned cleaning message, but the taste was day one to two years later. Turns out a teaspoon of lemon juice will kill the plastic taste w/o adding a lemon taste.I consider this to be very well made, but I wish Camelbak had included the bite valve cover as a standard feature. Otherwise, the valve drags in the dirt each time I take my pack off.Can't imagine using a water bottle ever again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SR35J4WREV1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JNU70Q#wasThisHelpful","R3SR35J4WREV1X","AW3ME92UZVY3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3ME92UZVY3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Kennedy has suffered a lifetime of abuse, either at the hands of her biological parents or her husband; she’s finally had enough. When she runs into Corbin, an MMA fighter she had a crush on in high school, she begins to realize that she is stronger than she ever gave herself credit for. With the help of Corbin and her “adoptive parents” (her best friend’s parents whom took her in, saving her from further abuse), she finally leaves the man that has made her and her young daughter’s lives hell. But as she gets closer and closer to Corbin, she has to come to terms with her past, to find herself before she’s able to give herself to someone yet again.Corbin has his own issues. Dealing with the death of childhood friend in his formative years has left him with a sense of guilt he’s carried into adulthood. For years he has medicated himself with meaningless flings, so when Kennedy, the girl he secretly harbored a crush on in high school comes back into his life, he realizes he needs to tackle his own demons before he can give himself to someone else.As you might expect with two broken characters, their relationship is a bit of a rollercoaster. Add into it the complication of Kennedy’s daughter and the obvious love Corbin has for the both of them, they need to tread lightly, to make sure that there are no expectations of a happily ever after until they know they dedicate themselves fully.The absolute highlight of the book was Kennedy’s daughter Ashlynn. The interaction between her and Corbin was downright heartwarming, making it easy to root for the young family in the making. The relationship between Kennedy and Corbin was sweet with a side of steamy, a coupling fans of contemporary romance will easily embrace. The first person, dual POV gives readers a chance to see inside the thoughts and fears of each of the characters.While the book started out strong, by about the halfway point it started to fall. Unfortunately the author attempted to incorporate too many dramatic elements that were not resolved in any sort of meaningful way. Abuse, both spousal and parental, MMA fighter hero, second chance love, reunion with an estranged parent, allegations of cheating were all represented, but not with any significant depth to really make an impact on the story as a whole. The heroine’s ex-husband just kind of gives up and disappears, as does her abusive father. Perhaps if the author had explored just one or two of those tropes in depth, the book would have felt more cohesive than it did.In the acknowledgements section of the book there is a reference to both an editor and a proofreader, however I’m not sure if the arc I received had been seen by either of them, as there were numerous errors and plot holes. As a first time author Taylor holds a lot of promise, and I hope that my comments are accepted as constructive criticism, but the way that the book in its current incarnation is tough read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5UC1WOG6NBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515176479#wasThisHelpful","R1I5UC1WOG6NBM","AHFKFSBQJGO0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHFKFSBQJGO0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Adam has reached a level of desperation for money that he has decided to audition as a fitness model, a job that sometimes requires him to expose a little more of himself than he’s comfortable with. Originally from Nebraska, he is in L.A. with his mom and aunt as his mom fights her battle against cancer, which has depleted the family’s funds completely. In danger of losing her place in the treatment facility of their choice, Adam has decided he’ll do whatever it takes in order to keep her there in order to reclaim her health. But when Adam shows up on set, looking out of place and easily intimidated by the agency’s panel, he has to prove that he’s right for the job. After convincing them he’s the right choice, his career takes off, but not without the help of Solo, the photographer’s assistant and all-around badass.Solo, the product of two gay dads with a Han Solo obsession, has worked for Teeg models since the age of eighteen, assisting with shoots, wardrobe and marketing. She lives on the same grounds as the models, however not in the same house, leading to a close-knit relationship with all of the guys. After a failed relationship with a model, she has sworn them all off, not wanting to get burned again once they hit it big. But when geeky Adam signs with the agency, she falls and falls hard. Their mutual love of Star Wars and all things geek quickly proves that they just may have been made for one another, but Solo’s lack of faith coupled with the walls she’s constructed around her heart may be the undoing of their relationship before they even have a chance.“How long is your penis?”Was she for real? When did how long is your penis and how many times do you work out become casual questions in a job interview?“I-I’m not sure,” I answered honestly. “I never measured him before.”“A smile spread across her face. “Ahh, you call your penis a him.”“Well, he’s not a girl, if that’s what you’re implying.”“Does he have a name?”The minions all looked up and waited on the edge of their seats for my answer. Did I want this job that bad that I should continue to answer these questions?Yeah, I needed money…badly, so I swallowed my pride and mumbled out his name so it was barely audible to my own ears.“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear that, what’s his name?”My hands ran down my face and I said, “Just-In Beaver.”The room rang silent.Adam’s naiveté makes for some spectacularly hilarious moments, but also makes him completely loveable. He’s the kind of guy that finds a girl in Wonder Woman Underoos just as hot as the girl in the skimpiest of lingerie. And Solo, it’s so nice to encounter a character that isn’t ditzy, isn’t caught up in the fact that she’s constantly surrounded by scantily clad men, and can hold her own around the guys. She’s the antithesis of her best friend and co-worker Nolly, who regularly hooks up with the models and gives them the reigns in the relationship.“Is that some kind of reference to a woman’s lady garden?” Thaddeus asked, as he tried to understand the reference. “I believe that call it a muff? Am I right Bashty?”“Oh my God.” Solo said into her hands, after she set her doughnut down. “Dad, please don’t say muff.""""I think a muff is referring to a lady garden that hasn’t been properly landscaped,” Sebastian offered.“Oh, dear,” Thaddeus said, looking over at Solo. “Honey, please don’t tell me you have a muff.”One of the biggest highlights of the book is the relationship between Solo and her dads. They are over the top hilarious, yet the love they have for their daughter is obvious. Quinn has created characters that are easy to fall in love with, and you just can’t help to root for underdog Solo in the vapid world that can be modeling.“Don’t worry, honey, we’re not old biddies; we know you have youngins have overactive libidos,” my mom assured.Nodding her head, Solo looked at me and said, “Well did he at least tell you that when he jumped off the bed in shock from seeing my dads barge in, instead of shaking hands, he curtsied as if the Queen of England was standing in front of him, and when he got up, he cut wind louder than a freaking blow horn?”If Adam weren’t hot enough simply because of the way he interacts with Solo, then his relationship with his mom and aunt will make you fall in love. He’s the All-American boy next door, and the lengths that he’ll go to for him family feel genuine and downright swoonworthy.Quinn has crafted a laugh out loud story with heart, something we’ve come to expect from her. The book is written in a first person, dual POV, giving the reader great insight into the thoughts and motivations of each of the characters. It is well written, if not a little a little predictable, but all of the hilarious elements that make Solo’s life in particular completely overshadow that. The relationship between Solo and Adam is equal parts sweet and sizzling, and you’ll be sucked in from the very first page. If you need a quick pick me up, something to put a smile on your face that will last for a long while, check this one out. You’ll be happy you did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYDVAGGJT29S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515234177#wasThisHelpful","R1DYDVAGGJT29S","AHFKFSBQJGO0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHFKFSBQJGO0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Callie and Madison are best friends yet their marriages couldn’t be different from each other if they tried. Callie is married to her soul mate whereas Madison is married to her baby’s daddy, staying in a loveless marriage for the sake of their child. So when events begin to unravel leading to the demise of Madison’s marriage, Callie must not only help Madison get through the emotional upheaval, but reevaluate her own marriage, especially when some of her own husband’s actions become questionable.The story is told in both the past and the present and for the most part it is effective. It helps to get inside the head of the characters and see how those experiences shaped them. There were some twists that I didn’t see coming that I appreciated, but I did have some trouble connecting with the characters on any kind of meaningful level. I couldn’t help but feel that both of the women were a little on the doormat side and the relationship between Callie and her husband didn’t feel as strong as the author would make you believe it was.The basis for a great story is there, no doubt about it; but in it’s current state it is in dire need of an editor. There are numerous plot holes and inconsistencies, awkward word choices, changes of tense within the same paragraph, all things that detract from the story itself.  The storyline itself is intriguing and original, but as it stands now, it falls a bit flat in the grand scheme of things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TOM6SDZ3AKME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514760711#wasThisHelpful","R3TOM6SDZ3AKME","AHFKFSBQJGO0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHFKFSBQJGO0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.The One Addicted, the second book in The One Trilogy, picks up immediately where the first book leaves off. Lucia and Sebastian are on the outs after a woman claiming to be Sebastian’s girlfriend shows up, however it soon becomes apparent that there is more to the story than at first glance. Seems Toni is up to her old tricks in an attempt to break up the couple. But the pair prove that years of friendship and their budding romance mean far more to them than anything their past can throw at them and proceed to grow closer and closer.Much of the book is spent exploring Lucia and Sebastian’s relationship, both emotionally and physically. There is a bit more angst than in the first book with a lot of time back and forth wondering how they fit into each other’s lives and making assumptions of how committed they are to each other, assuming the other is on board for just the “friends with benefits” relationship they had agreed to. Once they finally get their feelings out of the way, they can pursue the type of relationship they had always hoped to.This volume though really starts to become intriguing in regards to the stranger that is stalking Lucia, and just how bold he is becoming. She is starting to pick up on clues that the stranger is leaving behind; as he gets bolder, he is getting sloppier. The book was already a great blend of sexy and hope for a lasting relationship, the added suspense makes it one that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Friends-to-lovers is one of my favorite tropes and I am very excited to see how it ends for Lucia and Sebastian (and Finn, I LOVE the dynamic of the three of them together). Due to the angst and waffling of the main characters (ugh! Just communicate already!) this one wasn’t quite up to par with the first, but I have no doubt that North plans for this series to go out with a bang!This book is NOT a standalone. You will need to have read book one, The One Awakened before starting this one.

"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.I’m still not sure I forgive Fallowfield for her last installment of The Domville, a story that felt like it left me gutted and gasping for air, but in this volume, she certainly made up for it. The events of this volume coincide with the events of the last volume, and while each of the books can be read independently, I HIGHLY suggest reading volume two before reading this one for full effect.Mandy is gearing up to be maid of honor at her older sister Lisa’s wedding. The night before the wedding the two are sharing an exclusive signature suite, where everything they could ever want or need is provided for them. After parting ways in the hotel’s lounge, Mandy heads off for a quickie with the bar’s piano man. But throughout their hot, quick encounter in the hotel’s pool, she can’t get thoughts of “Rampant” Roger out of her head, the manwhore of a best friend to Lisa’s fiancé, Brady.Mandy and Roger had hooked up previously at a wedding rehearsal and neither can get the other out of their mind. That’s not to say they haven’t tried, hooking up with others any chance they get (not unusual for either of them). But for some reason, their encounter just felt “different”. They antagonize each other, via witty banter, creating a sexual tension that is palpable. But can two people that make no assertions of being relationship material even think about having a relationship…together?Unlike the Shakespearian tragedy vibe of the last installment, Mandy and Roger’s story is one of hope. Don’t get me wrong, it is HOT as hell, but while Lisa and Brady’s story was about a relationship in crisis, Mandy and Roger’s story is about possibility. We also get a little more of a glimpse into Lisa and Brady’s story as well, which I appreciated, considering how I felt at the end of their story! Again Fallowfield has crafted another thoroughly engaging story with characters that are easy to care about.Again, this is a series of standalones, but I implore you to at least read the second volume before this one!

"Becs has spent the major part of her life in the foster care system and at the age of eighteen is working a job and trying to better herself. If her constant worries about money weren’t bad enough, she feels obligated to look after her older foster brother that is heavily involved in drugs. When she loses her job for reasons she’s not entirely clear, she takes her complain to Bray Spencer, the owner of the building that houses the coffee shop she worked for.Bray Spencer is a billionaire recluse that refuses to get involved with the opposite sex due to the unhealthy relationship of his parents. But over the course of a couple of months he becomes enamored with Becs, the colorful pixie, as he calls her. When she storms into his office demanding answers about her job, Bray finally has the opportunity to insert himself into her life.Bray takes her on his live in housekeeper/cook/assistant and eventually his lover. As their relationship gets out, it seems there are forces working from all sides in order to break them up. Will Bray end up just like his father and destroy the one thing he loves most? Will Becs ever be able to trust anyone? Or feel like she won’t be left behind, yet again?Maybe it’s my age, maybe it’s the volume of books I read but I’m finding it harder and harder to suspend disbelief. In the Romance genre there definitely needs to be some bending of timelines, belief, etc., but this book was way over the top. The man is in his mid-30s and is a virgin, who quickly becomes a sex god. He’s obsessed with an eighteen year old in a way that makes Christian Grey look like the best boyfriend in the world (like desperately wanting her to get pregnant so she can’t leave). He’s an investor that has paparazzi stalking him. There is just so much going on in the story without any real storyline, other than once they get it on, they do it a lot.I had picked this one up because the synopsis looked good and there was a lot of chatter about it in the book world, but it just didn’t do it for me. I didn’t connect with the characters and the storyline was kind of all over. This was my first book by this author but I would still check out some of her other work.

"Complimentary copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.When Lex Easton’s new line is, well…on the line, she must travel to Italy in order to meet with the Prince Massimo Tittoni, the owner of the Girasoli Garment Company, who is holding the fabrics for her new line hostage, due to non-payment. Easton Essentials, the company Lex built from the ground up, is teetering on the edge of failure and without the superior Girasoli fabrics to create her signature line, she will find herself flat broke with nothing to show for it for the second time in her life. Her goal is to convince the playboy prince to release her fabrics, but when Massimo propositions her, will Lex do what it takes in order to save not only her company but her employees as well?Massimo is fodder for the tabloids and when Lex first makes his acquaintance it’s obvious his reputation is well earned. But could there be more to the prince than she originally though? What are Massimo’s reasons for shielding his heart? More importantly, is his proposal to Lex more personal or business? Can the two work together?Things move lightning fast between the two and as you might expect, the tabloids find some major dirt in order to smear not only the relationship between Lex and Massimo, but also Lex the rising star in the fashion world. Just how far out of each of their comfort zones are they willing to come in order to make it work. Told in the third person with I guess, for lack of a better way to describe it, first person interjections throughout, you get a look into the minds of each of the characters.Aster has certainly created an animated cast of characters and has set them up nicely for subsequent books in the series. It is obvious that there is a great deal of affection between them given their history and it made their interactions feel genuine. One of the things that really started to grate on me though as the book progressed was the constant name-dropping. I understand that it is a book about fashion, but at some point it becomes tedious knowing that everything a certain character is wearing is of a certain label, vintage, or price.The book was fun and definitely hot and would make great reading for the beach or poolside, but it just seems that there were so many opportunities wasted to give it a little more substance. Lex’s troubled relationship with her parents is the catalyst in decisions she’s made and the way she chooses to live her life both publicly and privately, yet Aster does very little to touch on Lex’s history. Yes, there is a prequel series that was released after the fact, yet I’m still not sure how it would give any more insight into WHO Lex really is.The lack of depth, coupled with the over the top sex scenes and insta-love (marriage proposals within days) made this one a challenge for me and I’m not sure how invested I am in the characters or storyline.

As the half-brother to Bax and cop that often has to deal with the gray area between right and wrong for the sake of the greater good, we’ve gotten to know the man that he is. Only this time, we get a more in depth look into why he makes the choices he does. Loyal to a fault, Titus needs to decide where his priorities lie, especially when it comes to matters of the heart.Reeve is the dark haired beauty that is persona non grata in The Point after not only setting up the abduction of Dovie, but then going into WITSEC in order to testify against crime boss Novak’s crew. When the Marshall tasked to protect her turns out to be a bad cop obsessed with her, Reeve risks it all by heading back to The Point with evidence in hand, looking for one man and one man only…Titus King.Even when the two were adversaries before she disappeared into WITSEC, there was no denying the attraction between the two, so when she turns up at the police station, desperate and afraid for her life, Titus’s protective instincts take over, fanning the flames of the attraction once again. What results is a tale of steamy suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Following the fall of Novak’s empire, there has been an increase in crime as new organizations look to take a foothold in The Point. But things aren’t quite as they seem with the new bad guy in town. Turns out there is a whole lot more history there than either Titus or Bax know about and neither them, nor anyone they love, is safe until the threat is neutralized. But just how many more people will die in the meantime?As Titus and Reeve face down their adversaries, they get closer; they find that they are able to provide each other with what they’re missing. Titus is the man who takes care of everyone, yet doesn’t have anyone to take care of him. Reeve is the girl who is good at her core, yet has had to make hard choices in order to survive. Together they are a perfect storm, but only time will tell if they’ll both make it out alive.I love this series. It’s the right amount of steamy that is chock full of action and drama that keeps the story moving quickly and keeps you riveted. Titus is probably one of my favorite characters and I loved getting further into his head. The storyline in this volume also sets up the scene perfectly for the next installment as well where we get Nassir’s story.My only complaint with the book is the ending. For the amount of drama and the depth of the relationship forged between Titus and Reeve I would have expected an ending that felt more “complete”, for lack of a better word. It felt a little rushed and I would have liked to see a little bit more resolution, especially when it came to Reeve’s relationships with those that she had previously wronged, but hopefully we won’t see the last of her as the story continues. That’s why this one isn’t quite a five star, but it’s pretty damned close.In order to fully appreciate the series you definitely need to start with the first book. You won’t be sorry. If you’re a fan of sizzling suspense, this is the series for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ8IHDZVPP2BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OG9IVNY#wasThisHelpful","RJ8IHDZVPP2BM","AHFKFSBQJGO0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHFKFSBQJGO0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.When Baylor wakes up in a hospital with no memory of her life much less her name, she embarks on a journey to find answers. Her physical wounds have healed, but when left on her own to figure things out, it is Grady, a hospital volunteer, that comes to the rescue, giving her a place to stay, clothes and food. She soon meets his next-door neighbor and stepbrother, Brandt. Baylor immediately feels a connection with both of the brothers, but can’t help feeling that they are going through their own issues, issues that seem to be magnified by her presence. When she realizes that their intensity might be hindering her recovery, she chooses to go it alone and attempt to put the pieces of her memory back together.Baylor learns why she ended up in the hospital to begin with and after starting therapy with a renowned psychiatrist practicing experimental methods of memory recall, the memories begin to flood in, leaving Baylor to deal with her losses all over again. But can she do things differently this time? Can she turn to those that were there for her all along, or do they risk losing her all over again?Based on the events of the 2008 Chatsworth train collision, Forgotten Treasures is a story of love, heartbreak, and second chances. It is deeply emotional and tragic. While the characters in this book are fictional, we are given a glimpse into just how tragedy affects not only our bodies, but our minds as well. The emotional and mental scars are often deeper than the physical ones and as individuals we each deal with and mask these challenges differently.The writing itself is excellent, conveying all of the emotions, both joyous and heartbreaking, beautifully. The characters are multi-layered and relatable, heartbreakingly so. My only issue with the story was the ending. Unfortunately both the final chapter and epilogue felt rushed. I felt so invested in the characters that there felt like there was more to be said and it wasn’t there. This is a possible ugly cry read for some so you’ve been warned, but I urge you to take a chance, you won’t be sorry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAIBVOWVFPV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991601270#wasThisHelpful","R1EAIBVOWVFPV1","AHFKFSBQJGO0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHFKFSBQJGO0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Complimentary copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Alyssa married the love of her life and thought they would spend the rest of their lives together, but when her husband Rob succumbs to cancer, she finds herself a young widow, unable to move past the loss of “the one”. Fast forward two years and she comes upon an envelope Rob had given her before his death, only to be opened when she was ready to move on. Inside are thirty index cards, each with an activity designed to get her back in touch with herself sexually, which in turn puts her back in touch with herself emotionally.Harrison is the new guy in Alyssa’s condo complex, living in a unit used for short-term residents working on contract. When he bumps into her in the hall, he is immediately interested, and when she comes to him with a proposition he can’t refuse, the two embark on an interesting relationship in which they both find out far more about themselves than they had anticipated. But how much of herself is Alyssa willing to give away, and can she move past the ghost of her husband? Does Harrison have his own baggage keeping him from pursuing a relationship other than sexual with Alyssa? Or will someone from his past come back to sabotage any chance they have?I loved how the relationship between Harrison and Alyssa begins antagonistic, with a push and pull fueled by witty banter and sexual tension. But as the two spend more and more time together and their experiences deviate away from the cards, they begin to forge a friendship that serves as the basis for “more”. While it starts with sex, it becomes a friends to lovers story, a trope which I’m a huge sucker for.There were a few times that I wanted to grab Alyssa by the shoulders and shake some sense into her, but at the same time, I can understand her hesitation to move forward. I would have liked to get into Harrison’s head to maybe connect a little more with his thoughts and emotions, as it is apparent that he is far more invested in the relationship at some points than Alyssa.I also loved the dynamic that the secondary characters brought to the story, especially those of Mr. and Mrs. Le Page, the long married couple who seemed to always be up to some shenanigans, proving that even in old age, it is easy to still be deeply in love. Mrs. Le Page serves as a sort of motherly figure, nudging Alyssa to move on, imparting words of wisdom that make Alyssa understand that the best way to honor Rob’s memory is by continuing to live her life in the most joyous ways possible.Overall, this is a sweet, very steamy story of second chances that is full of hope and heartbreak that fans of contemporary romance and erotica will enjoy. While considered erotica, the story is so much more than that. This is my first read by this author and definitely not my last. I’m definitely looking forward to the next book in the series, 30 Nights, to be released next year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8L97KMT9ZUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53E0H6#wasThisHelpful","R1O8L97KMT9ZUX","AHFKFSBQJGO0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHFKFSBQJGO0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Quest for a Moral Compass: A global history of ethics by Kenan Malik, Atlantic Books, London, 2014, 392pp.The title of this book tells us precisely what it is about – it is an introduction to the history of humanity’s search for ethical values. It presents a survey of moral issues raised by philosophers from those of ancient Greece to 20th century philosophers like G.E. Moore and the pragmatists. It is skilfully written but, as an author and publisher myself, I would see the market for this book being mainly among lay or academic students of philosophy.The much shorter books on ‘Ethics’ by J.L. Mackie (Penguin) and ‘Moral Philosophy’ by D.D. Raphael (Oxford) are much more accessible for the interested layman, and I found Richard Norman’s ‘The Moral Philosophers’ (Oxford) the most useful as a student though, dating as they do, from the end of the 20th century they might be regarded by some as out-of-date. While certain moral issues come and go with time and others vary between societies, there are certain basic issues which are timeless and universal – like needing to distinguish between what is subjective and what is objective; or recognizing what role intuitions play in prescribing or inhibiting moral behaviour.I think Tom Holland’s comment on the book jacket that Malik’s treatise could ever replace Bertrand Russell’s ‘History of Western Philosophy’ is quite mistaken: Malik’s book deals with only a small section of the subject of philosophy. Malik is a lecturer, writer and broadcaster who specializes in the history and philosophy of science, and of biology in particular.Ethics is perhaps the most personal and subjective of all the branches of philosophy, compared with the philosophy of science, metaphysics or even religion. So while an author can recount what philosophers have said about moral issues through the ages, interpreting these views with regard to their significance for contemporary society is inevitably very much a matter of an author’s personal viewpoint. Malik seems to come down firmly on the side of relativism. In summarizing near the end of the book Malik says: ‘Questions of morality do not have objective answers in the way that scientific questions do, but neither are they merely expressions of subjective desire or taste’. My feeling is that many ethical questions are precisely that.At the end of the book, there are Reference Notes to each chapter, a ten-page Bibliography of further reading and an Index that was sufficiently detailed for me to find out something about each of the moral philosophers and their issues that I knew about.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OQ5QIWFPQZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612194036#wasThisHelpful","R5OQ5QIWFPQZ3","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Plato at the Googleplex: Why philosophy won’t go away, by Rebecca Newberger Goldstein; Pantheon Books (Random House), New York, 2014; Atlantic Books, London, 2014, 462 pp.The public perception of philosophy is that it is a somewhat abstruse subject, of little or no relevance to the way we live our everyday lives. Goldstein shows that this is far from the case by considering the life and work of perhaps the most famous of Greek philosophers – Plato. It was A.N. Whitehead who said that all Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato.Of course, Plato’s writings reflect the age and mores of the society in which he lived, so inevitably many of the principles of moral behaviour and fragments of knowledge that are commonplace today are not to be found here, and vice versa (or perhaps I should say antistropha!). Goldstein re-interprets the two dozen dialogues of Plato as if he were alive and addressing some of the problems of society today.Goldstein uses many quotations from the original Platonic dialogues where these are illustrative, but her Plato is presented within a present-day scenario: at Google headquarters discussing whether crowd-sourcing can answer all ethical questions; he is on a panel of child-rearing experts discussing how to raise a child so that it will shine; he visits a cognitive neuroscience laboratory to have his brain scanned and to discuss whether the problems of free will and personal identity can be resolved by brain imaging.As Goldstein points out, the Greeks were only one of several civilizations generating and exploring unique world-views of the value of human life – in the Mediterranean region there were also the Ivrim or Hebrews and the Zoroastrians while to the East Confucius, Lao Tzu and Chang Tzu in China and Siddhartha Gautama in India were proposing ethical visions of their own, but all maintaining that one must exert oneself in order to achieve a life that matters to others.This is a wonderful if challenging book that explores many of the issues that trouble contemporary society. Provided one is not daunted by the size, the text is very readable and the witty chapter headings tell us what to expect within: Chapter 1, alpha, ‘Man walks into a seminar room’ lays out some fundamental philosophical issues about life on other planets, what value we place on our own life relative to that of others (who would we die for, or donate our organs to?), and other ‘thought-experiments’ [As an aside, the EPR thought-experiment was one of the most significant developments in early quantum physics].To return to Goldstein: Chapter 5, epsilon, ‘I don’t know how to love him’ deals with erotic and largely homosexual relationships in ancient Greece. The following chapter, sigma, ‘xxxPlato’, answers personal questions addressed to an agony aunt.This is a book intended not just for philosophy students but for general readers who consider themselves to be active and thoughtful participants in contemporary society. The style of writing on a potentially challenging subject is fluid, accessible and entertaining. The book concludes with both a Bibliography and an Index.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9N840022R5UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307456722#wasThisHelpful","R9N840022R5UN","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Afterlife Teaching from Stephen the Martyr by Michael Cocks, White Crow Books, Guildford, 2011, 324 ffThe author of this book was formerly the Anglican vicar of a parish in Christchurch, New Zealand. He is also one who is enlightened enough to accept that there are people among us who can access the thoughts of discarnate souls. The author obtained a Master’s Degree in philosophy from the University of New Zealand and a Master’s Degree in theology from the University of Oxford.The text has arisen from spiritual sessions attended by the author in New Zealand during the 1970s at the home of Thomas and Olive Ashman. The Ashmans had emigrated to New Zealand from Sevenoaks in Kent. Thomas was a trance medium with a Catholic mother and a Jewish father but apart from a little Yiddish he picked up at home he spoke no languages other than his native English, but in trance spoke Latin and, on two occasions, in an ancient Greek dialect. The text is presented here in more than 170 short sections on a range of subjects.When Thomas went into trance his spirit guide called himself Stephen. It soon emerged that this guide was in fact the Stephen who became the first Christian martyr. Stephen was a deacon in the church in Jerusalem who was stoned to death for blasphemy by members of local synagogues. The only primary source for information about Stephen is the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament.In the trance sessions, the ten or so members of the group, including Rev. Cocks, asked questions of ‘Stephen’ and elicited replies. The conversations covered a wide range of subjects, beginning with: our purpose on Earth. Unsurprisingly, Stephen confirmed what other mediums have transmitted – that material comforts, though important to us in mortal life, are of no importance in our spiritual development. He compares the human body as carrier of the soul to the clothes that we wear in earthly life: we are still the same body without the clothes; we are still the same souls without our bodies. As immortal souls in Spirit we look back on our mortal lives and see ‘many images that we might learn of ourselves’ like ever-changing reflections in a pool. The circumstances we encounter in life influence our decisions: the path we choose to follow is the path determined by karma in Spirit decided by us before incarnation. Our earthly knowledge is limited: we can measure the water in a jug or weigh the sand in a glass but we cannot measure the water in the oceans of the world or the sand in all of its beaches.I clearly cannot do justice, within a review of a few hundred words, to the wisdom presented here in more than 300 pages of questions and profound responses. Many answers are given in enlightening but thought-provoking metaphors. This is not a book to be skimmed through – it is an intense wisdom teaching about how and why we should live our lives the way we do. Although there are many references to Jesus Christ, the underlying messages are relevant to those of any religion – or none.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N1L4316ZZYNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907661921#wasThisHelpful","R1N1L4316ZZYNO","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nature of Things by Lyall Watson, Hodder & Stoughton, 1990, 256 ffThis book is a fitting sequel to the two editions of the Supernature book and Lifetide by the same author and publishers. Lyall Watson, who died in 2008, was a life scientist born in South Africa. At university he studied palaeontology under Raymond Dart and biology with Desmond Morris. As a scientist he adopts a straightforward, rational exploration of phenomena that used to be called supernatural or paranormal but which are now regarded by an increasing number of enlightened scientists and philosophers as a normal, if less frequent, part of the natural world.There is a phrase in the second edition of Watson’s ‘Supernature’ book: ‘it begins to look as though information about past events can indeed be stored in physical objects’, which encapsulates the spirit of much of what Watson discusses in the present book. Now the sceptic will dismiss as pure coincidence the examples of ‘acausal connectivity’ that Watson describes here. But those who believe in connection between people and events through the medium of some kind of cosmic energy, whether divine or not, will find many remarkable accounts here for which we would have difficulty finding a rational explanation: ‘Some stone seems to have a capacity for storing and releasing energy’.  Watson cites the Rollright Stones of Oxfordshire in England as an example, but indigenous people have long associated divine spiritual energy with natural stone structures or artificial megaliths the world over. Crystals are used as aids in spiritual healing. Are the effects produced by such stones real? As Watson says: ‘Substance is an illusion. Everything we know and experience is mediated through our minds . . .’ Mineral stones and seashells are worn as necklaces, amulets and armbands partly for adornment but also because they are believed to invoke ‘magic’ powers.Carvings of Jesus, Mary, the Buddha or various Hindu gods are venerated as symbols of the power that these individuals possessed during earthly life. Such power, for good or ill, is believed to be held in objects blessed by shamans and witch-doctors. Dictators always want pictures or statues of themselves distributed around their respective nations to remind the populace of their power and influence. Such graven images possess their power from the beliefs – respect, awe, fear – of the people that see them. Today, we leave bunches of flowers at places where someone has met an untimely death, not only as a mark of respect but because we believe that such tokens in some way communicate our sense of loss to the departed soul.The final chapter, ‘The Ghost In The Machine’ deals with physical evidence pointing to the existence, in life and after mortal death, of the human soul. There is much food for thought in this book and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the spiritual nature of things. There is a list of References and a quite adequate Index to conclude the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BH0STT3V82P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=089281408X#wasThisHelpful","R7BH0STT3V82P","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Supernature II by Lyall Watson, Sceptre (p.b.; Hodder and Stoughton), 1986, 352 ff.Lyall Watson, who died in 2008, was a life scientist born in South Africa. At university he studied palaeontology under Raymond Dart and biology with Desmond Morris. As a scientist he adopts a straightforward, rational exploration of phenomena that used to be called supernatural or paranormal but which are now regarded by an increasing number of enlightened scientists and philosophers as part of the natural world.In this book, the first edition of which appeared more than a decade earlier, Watson explores subjects ranging from Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis to Richard Dawkins’ memes, Robert Becker’s use of electromagnetic radiation to assist bone healing, but also reports of various biochemical disorders arising from exposure of some individuals to concentrated e.m. fields from power lines. There is discussion of several phenomena in parapsychology and their interpretation in the light of the properties of the world at the quantum level.This is an eminently readable and thought-provoking book but it needs to be approached with an open mind – as the author says: ‘there are as yet undiscovered ways in which the inner self and the outer world entwine’ and ‘it begins to look as though information about past events can indeed be stored in physical objects.’ This book gives us all an insight into the significance of the New Physics in our everyday lives.For those who enjoy this book I would recommend one of the sequels, The Nature of Things, by the same author and publisher from 1990.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347ISMWK70M6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0340413522#wasThisHelpful","R347ISMWK70M6X","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sacred Contracts: Awakening your divine potential by Caroline Myss, Bantam Books, 2002, 528 ff.Caroline Myss has now written over a dozen books. She practiced as a medical intuitive for nearly twenty years and for the past decade has travelled extensively lecturing on developing spirituality. As a former journalist she has an easily accessible writing style, but this book requires sustained effort to get through, partly because of its length and partly because it deals with rather nebulous spiritual concepts.The basic idea behind the book may put off some potential readers at the outset. The book is based on the concept of existence of the soul in the spirit world from which we contract with Spirit to fulfil certain goals in our mortal lives on Earth. Clearly, to get anything from this book, you must believe in the concept of soul with its spiritual existence before and after life on Earth, and in the concept of reincarnation. Caroline follows Eastern mystical teaching when she says: ‘According to the laws of karma, just as your actions in this life plant seeds that ripen and bear fruit in future lives, so your current lifetime reflects your past deeds.’ The prevailing rational, scientific philosophy of our time would say that whatever happens to you depends entirely on your genes!This book suggests answers to the perennial question: Why are we here? Or, Why do we and the world exist at all? The book describes principles to follow in following our mission in life through interactions with other people – in that it is inspirational and in that it belongs to the genre of self-help books. Discovering our true vocation in life by listening to our inner voice is a process of spiritual transformation that may take us a substantial part of our lives to learn.The whole book is full of stories, both mythical and true life experiences, and it is these which carry the reader forward from one page to the next: we read the story as a story, then pause to reflect on its meaning as an allegory or parable. There are many references to the ideas of Jung, to the Bible and to texts of Eastern mysticism, but I didn’t find the reference to somewhat arbitrary ‘archetypes’ particularly helpful. As I said at the outset, the book needs some staying power, but I found it a worthwhile journey.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50FQNL0SC03X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0609810111#wasThisHelpful","R50FQNL0SC03X","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chaos Point: The world at the crossroads, by Ervin Laszlo, Piatkus, London, 2006, 206 ff.The author, who has written many books on a variety of subjects, is probably best described as a futurist – someone who examines the ills of society with the purpose and hope of turning unfavourable situations around for the benefit of all concerned. Many of the problems he defines here have been described by previous authors, and addressed through the work of international social or environmental agencies.The core issue described here is that humankind is on course for extinction if we either ignore global problems or simply tinker at the edges in addressing them. The economic and environmental conditions existing in the world will soon (within decades?) reach a ‘tipping point’ or ‘chaos point’ beyond which they will change irreversibly and possibly disastrously unless we take coordinated global action to alter attitudes and practices, in both the rich and developing countries alike.So, many agencies are convinced that there is an urgent need for change in social philosophies. But how is this to be achieved? Individual human nature is likely to be essentially the same in the next few decades as it has been in the past few decades. It is only by coordinated action by influential groups of people that any worthwhile changes can be implemented. Such groups will have many factors working against them and over which they will have little control – violent political upheavals; global epidemics like AIDS, bird flu or Ebola; rapidly changing weather systems; exponentially increasing global population; and, as nations are forced to work ever more closely together, an increasing anti-globalization movement.The author questions whether these factors would comprise complete ‘limits to growth’ or rather that they would provide limits to growth only as we have seen it in the past. After a brief digression into chaos theory in general, Laszlo considers how these destabilizing factors may lead to the ‘tipping point’ or ‘chaos point’. There are some disturbing statistics here. The average amount of commercial electrical energy consumed by Africans is 0.5 kWh per person; for Australians and Americans this increases up to 8 kWh per person. The U.S. alone consumes 25% of the world’s energy but has only 4% of the world population. These are the trends we must divert. Greed is still the dominant philosophy in the affluent countries of the world.There are excellent succinct sections here on economic, ecological and social unsustainabilities. Laszlo describes how there have been ‘shifts in civilizations’ in the historical past – from Mythos to Theos to Logos in philosophical terms – and how we need to provoke a corresponding global change now.The Postscript section of this book on the scientific background to these human social trends is rather less generally accessible but the Appendix of Comments by Members and Partners of the Club of Budapest (Peter Russell, Ed Mitchell, Karan Singh, Thomas Berry and others) makes interesting reading. This is a highly thought-provoking book.

"Mind into Matter: A new alchemy of science and spirit by Fred Alan Wolf, Moment Point Press, Needham, MA, 2001, 178 ff.The author, who has written over a dozen books, is a theoretical and quantum physicist. He was formerly a professor at San Diego State University and his specialty is the interface between physics and belief systems and practices. His emphasis here is on the spiritual aspects of alchemy rather than the popular view that the focus of their intentions was to turn base metals into gold. Alchemists were the forerunners of the chemists of today, but their philosophy went much deeper than mere laboratory practices. Wolf’s ‘new alchemy’ is a new way of seeing the old way, and he relates it to spiritual meanings of the Hebrew alphabet.In the first chapter, Wolf discusses the mechanistic interpretation of inertia, as described in Newton’s first law of motion, and interprets this as the alchemists did in humanistic terms as our resistance to change and our tendency to follow the prevailing public opinion, especially with regard to religion. However, the age of information technology means that the ‘The old adage “you are what you eat” has changed into “you are what you know” or [more insidiously] you are what you believe’: individual belief has become equated to knowledge or truth.Chapter Four is a key chapter in the book as it deals with the nature of mind and its two-way interaction with matter, and the resulting concept of the self. As mind cannot be studied with scientific objectivity, this is where Wolf’s ‘new alchemy’ comes in, to try to reveal ‘the secret connection between matter and mind’. The new alchemy develops the awareness of how mind and matter (most especially, the human body) interact.Chapter Six discusses morality and suggests that Charles Darwin’s representation of evolution as ‘the survival of the fittest’ became popular, rather than its predecessors from Erasmus Darwin and others, because it endorsed competition as a biological inevitability. As I have pointed out elsewhere, this also accounted for the popularity of Darwin’s ideas rather than those of his contemporary Alfred Russel Wallace, whose suggestion of ‘intelligent design’ in evolution was ahead of its time.The eighth and ninth Hebrew letters, hhayt and tayt, and their respective chapters, suggest the role of energy in the formation and development of the universe. There is an interesting Appendix on Existence as The Mind in a Box, several pages of Notes on the text, a Bibliography and an Index.I didn’t find this an easy book to read, even though it’s quite short. The connections between quantum physics and the spiritual dimension of life were better explained, in my opinion, by several earlier books, like those of Fritjof Capra or the Dalai Lama. I frequently found it difficult to see where the author’s argument was taking me, though it does contain some interesting ideas and if you want another approach to the quantum physics and spirituality debate, this will provide you with one.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of Consciousness","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MXBL2CLAXABC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0966132769#wasThisHelpful","R2MXBL2CLAXABC","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chuang Tzu, The Inner Chapters, translated by Solala Towler, Watkins Publishing, London, 2010, 192 ff.Chuang Tzu (or Zhuangzi) is both the title and the author of a classic Taoist text that may have originated as far back as the 4th century BCE. This would make it contemporary with the ‘Tao Te Ching’ of Lao Tzu, but some scholars put Lao Tzu and the school he founded as early as the 6th century BCE.According to Dr Russell Kirkland, an Associate Professor of Religion at the University of Georgia in the USA, it is more likely that the Chuang Tzu is the work of another much later Taoist, Kuo Hsiang, from the 3rd century CE. The work of 33 chapters has come down to us in three parts. Part 1, The Inner Chapters, comprises7 chapters; Part 2 called The Outer Chapters is the main part of the work consisting of 15 chapters; and the remaining 11 chapters comprise The Mixed Chapters, thought to have been written by various authors.It is this first part that is presented here in a translation by Solala Towler, a Taoist scholar and author of 12 books on Qigong and the Taoist arts. The text is presented as a succession of stories between sages and their students explaining some of the principles of Taoism. There are also various sections of commentary by Towler. The text is lavishly illustrated by inspiring black-and-white photographs, many taken by Towler himself.The presentation, both in the text and in its production, reflects the mystical nature of the content. Personally, I find the Taoist message more direct in the Tao Te Ching and I relate less well to this story-telling approach; but this says more about me than about the text. There is a quote from the Tao in the text, which is an accurate reflection of Taoist thought: ‘In the pursuit of knowledge / every day something more is added. / In the pursuit of Tao / every day something is let go of.’ This expresses the essential wu wei of Taoist thought – of accepting life as it is, of taking time out for reflection and meditation, to respect all living things, and always living in such a way as to enhance the lives of others as far as we are able.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXGFTJY04DPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780280203#wasThisHelpful","R1TXGFTJY04DPN","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Eagle’s Quest by Fred Alan Wolf, Simon and Schuster (Touchstone), 1991, 324 ff.A physicist enters the world of the shamanThis is an autobiographical story of the author’s contact with shamans in North and South America and how he has interpreted his experiences among native peoples in terms of psychology and quantum physics. Wolf intended to record his experiences as a disinterested scientific observer, but soon found that the only way to get any real insight into shamanic practices was to totally immerse himself in their way of life – in fact, to become a shamanic initiate.Wolf came to accept many of the fundamental beliefs of shamans: that the universe is made of vibrations emanating from a supreme power and that shamans saw the world through myths and visions that were alien to the mechanical concepts of Newtonian physics – in the world of quantum physics, past, present and future form a continuum of reality such that all events are interconnected and shamans have long held to this belief. This leads Wolf to conclude that people only see what they already believe – a truism long established in psychology. Many shamanic practices are what the uninformed would describe as magic. Shamans enter into other states of consciousness while in trance just as subatomic particles may inhabit other universes.Shamans could derive wisdom through trance connection with their sacred places: ‘Shamans were able to use their healing powers best when they were working on the very grounds from which they grew themselves’. Powers that work at one location may not work at another. There are several pages on an exploration of ley lines with author Paul Devereux. Describing Jesus as an ancient shaman, Wolf maintains that one of the principal functions of the shaman is to heal people connect with one another and with the Earth. And Chapter 10 gives us some useful spiritual insights into the nature of mortal death.I didn’t find I could relate to all the anthropomorphic analogies between shamans and their practices and quantum physics – like using the attraction between photons and the repulsion between electrons as an analogy for human love and hate – but overall this was quite an interesting book. The book reads rather like a novel but, to summarize Wolf’s approach, I would describe it as a quite academic autobiography with a Bibliography at the end and an Index.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of Consciousness","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWM8HFE9R4DCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671792911#wasThisHelpful","RWM8HFE9R4DCU","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our Lives in the Light: A book of life, by Amy Kingdom; self-published 2013, 200 ff.This is a very honest and very raw book relating the author’s perception and feelings about incidents in her life. She is very candid about where she feels she is an imperfect soul and is striving to avoid being hypocritical or judgmental. Many would read her writings and feel that she ‘overthinks’ these situations, but she comes across as genuine in her beliefs and, as part of being a scientist, constantly seeks to know and understand more.This is a biography but it is not written in chronological order. The author takes themes and deals with them individually as chapters of the book, like growth, lessons, births, deaths and so forth.At the end of each chapter she has a conversation with her sister, Dawn, which gives her an opportunity to expand on what has been covered in each chapter. This is an innovative way of being able to delve more deeply into each issue or cover peripheral parts of the subject. It also raises further questions, which often remain unanswered leaving the reader to ponder on them.Many people who are likely to read this may be tempted not to read to the end of the book because the situations and observations seem to be quite mundane but it’s worth persisting. Apart from the spiritual aspects and life lessons that emerge, it gives a good description of the ethos of growing up in an African country. One of her teachers impressed me with his innovative ideas for allowing the children to learn about life; regrettably, health and safety, and potential litigation, issues in the UK would prevent teachers here giving free rein to their imaginations in the same way.The writing feels quite nave but there are profound insights to be found in the book and, indeed, it is often from someone’s naïve approach that we learn the most. The Bible was written very many years after the events it claims to describe and many people today regard its stories as largely irrelevant to everyday life, but clearly the author finds meaning in it by interpreting it and weaving it into her own life in a way that gives her an insight into the purpose of each individual life, and particularly her own.This is an unusual book which I quite enjoyed reading, perhaps because it was so different from books I usually read for review and despite the fact that it is quite fragmentary in its coverage of the author’s life. My only real criticism would be that I would have liked the author to expand further on many of the topics she raised; there were many times when I felt she was skimming over the surface and not writing the remainder of her ideas which would have made it a more rounded, and perhaps more interesting, book.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF48KV6LSOU1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX8L2PU#wasThisHelpful","RF48KV6LSOU1P","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this quite a depressing film, though Selleck’s acting as always was good. Jim Rainwood (Tom Selleck) is an aircraft engineer and is emerging from his shower when two cops burst into his home and shoot him, first, mistaking him for a drug dealer and second thinking that the hair dryer he has in his hand is a gun. In fact it isn’t even the right house – not that these cops are too bothered as they are on the take anyway. Of course, they have the usual ‘throw down’ gun available to frame the victim – all too close to customary practice in U.S. law enforcement for my taste.Most of the film is about the life of intimidation and persecution Rainwood suffers in prison – until he is provoked into seeking retribution for the abuse he suffers. I found this movie unsatisfactory and unconvincing, though the grim realities of prison life are stark enough. First, his very sweet wife Kate (Laila Robins) doesn’t seem to have much idea about getting a decent lawyer to defend her husband. Secondly, I would be appalled if the police really did make so little effort to establish the true facts of a case against an upright citizen with no record of involvement with drugs. I certainly wouldn’t want to watch this again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AA5QGVWBJNV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008978T#wasThisHelpful","R2AA5QGVWBJNV3","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ubiquity: The science of history, or why the world is simpler than we think, by Mark Buchanan, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2000, 240 ff.The dictionary defines ‘ubiquity’ as ‘omnipresence; occurring everywhere at the same time’.And what this book is about is ‘chance’ and ‘chaos’ and the role these concepts play in our lives. The author is an American-born physicist and writer who has contributed to ‘Nature’ and to ‘New Scientist’ before becoming a freelance author. His several books aim to make complex scientific ideas comprehensible to the general public in an accessible writing style.The book ranges in subject matter over earthquakes, economic crises, electron field patterns, forest fires, meteorology, geological extinctions and many other complex systems that involve chaos and scientific unpredictability: Buchanan shows us how tipping points or critical points arise in these many different systems. Disappointingly there is nothing on information networks, which have become such an important subject in many fields, and I think that to describe this book as ‘The science of history’ is misleading. If James Gleick had not already published a book called ‘Chaos’, that might have made a more appropriate title.

"Reality Shifts: When consciousness changes the physical world by Cynthia Sue Larson, Reality Shifters, Berkeley, CA, 2012, 312 ffThose who embrace the fact that there is a spiritual dimension to our existence will have grown accustomed by now to the ideas presented in a number of books that describe how our state of mind produces positive or negative effects on our physical health (books on the power of intention from authors such as Louise Hay, Larry Dossey, Wayne Dyer and Sharon Begley). Spiritual or not, we are all aware of the potency of placebos used in medicine. Other authors, like Lynne McTaggart and Charles T. Tart, have described how the human mind can affect even inanimate objects through phenomena described as psychokinesis, telekinesis or teleportation. Such are the Reality Shifts described here by the present author: ‘physically observed changes that occur without any direct physical intervention’. Although people tend to be sceptical about such a suggestion, the author points out that change and a shift in what is the reality of our perceptions happens continually all around us.The author stresses that we are all changing the reality of all-that-is with our every thought and action, from the most trivial to the most far-reaching. Two of the most fascinating chapters in the book for me were Chapters 3 and 4, which describe a number of ‘irrational’ events that happened to the author, her family and friends. I have never experienced such dramatic reality shifts myself, but my wife is a spiritual healer and has certainly produced reality shifts in the lives of others (see Chapter 9 here).Some people just seem to be so much in tune with the spiritual realm that psychic events of various kinds keep happening to them. Physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who together with C.G. Jung had a deep fascination with what was described then as the paranormal, was renowned for the disruptive effects he produced on any laboratory equipment nearby. Such physical changes in our surroundings, or the apports produced at séances, are a different order of phenomena than ‘mind-to-mind’ communication in telepathy or spiritual healing. These are Reality Shifts that all can see.Other highly original chapters were those on Lucid Dreaming and how we could make use of these experiences in our lives (Chapters 7 and 8). Considering this is a book about what is essentially a philosophical concept (the existence of a non-material reality) interpreted in terms of quantum physics (where indeterminism prevails), it is remarkably accessible. Cynthia, who has a background in physics, writes in everyday language without any technical jargon and she shows us how the phenomena she describes are all around us in our lives. She shows us how the materialistic assumptions of science are too limited to account for the diversity of human experience: ‘there are an infinite number of universes of reality for us to exist within’. There are also personal exercises at the ends of the chapters to move our consciousness in the direction of accepting and implementing these Reality Shifts. Basically, our life is to a large extent what we make of it.There are a few pages of Further Reading at the end, with several books that I hadn’t heard of but which I shall now want to read.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWFHW7SAR54W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1461075211#wasThisHelpful","RMWFHW7SAR54W","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chaos, Creativity and Cosmic Consciousness, by Rupert Sheldrake, Terence McKenna and Ralph Abraham, Park Street Press (Inner Traditions), Rochester, Vermont; 1992, 2001; 208 ff.In this book we eavesdrop as it were on a discussion between the three authors – a discussion that had gone on since 1982 and, more intensively, in public and private discussions at the Esalen Institute, California, in 1989 and 1990. For readers, it could be regarded as a companion volume to the discussion by Ervin Laszlo, Stanislav Grof and Peter Russell published in 1999 as ‘The Consciousness Revolution’. Ralph Abraham is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz; the late Terence McKenna was an explorer, philosopher and ethnologist; and Rupert Sheldrake is a biochemist and plant physiologist who studied, taught and carried out research respectively at Cambridge, England, at Harvard, and at the International Crops Research Institute in Hyderabad, India.On page 1, Sheldrake confronts us with a fundamental scientific dilemma: Are there eternal and unchanging laws of the universe, or is every facet of the universe constantly changing, developing, evolving – including the ‘laws of physics’? What then was the role of the Big Bang, if such an event occurred? Are there unchanging universal templates as suggested by Plato, or is there continual ongoing creativity, as suggested by Henri Bergson?Chapters Two and Three deal with how chaos – both in mathematical theory and in practice – can lead to definitive solutions, and how these ideas relate to human creativity and imagination. The latter chapter introduces us to C.H. Waddington’s concept of chreodes – grooves or runnels which our speakers speculate exist within the (hypothetical) morphogenetic fields. There is an interesting discussion about how the appearance of Jesus can be viewed as an example of either an ascending or descending developmental process.The next chapter debates the idea of a World Soul (after Plotinus), related once again to the role of chaos, which is followed by a discussion of the nature of vision and our other senses. Sheldrake discusses his idea of the sensation of vision being outside of the body but rather located where we say the objects we see actually lie. Chapter Six will be controversial I’m sure and is highly speculative: it deals with non-human intelligences and discarnate beings, and ranges over crop circles and the battle between good and evil.The final chapters deal with the unconscious, the collapse of faith in both religion and scientism, and the need for re-education of humanity in the sacralization of Earth if we are avoid the apocalypse and the extinction of humankind from the planet. The overall message is not gloomy but should serve as a warning for those in positions of power who still have greed and egotism as their main, if not their only, goals in their time on Earth.The book concludes with a useful Glossary of some of the technical words and a short Bibliography but there is no Index.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of Consciousness","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239Q3W3X3M8L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892819774#wasThisHelpful","R239Q3W3X3M8L0","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The other tracks are of original recordings. I particularly like a cappella recordings as the purity of the human voice comes through without being obliterated in places by thick orchestral textures. If you enjoy this composer’s melodies and harmonies, you will love this CD.

"The Self-Actualizing Cosmos: The Akasha revolution in science and human consciousness, by Ervin Laszlo; Inner Traditions, Rochester, Vermont, 2014, 208 ffScientists, philosophers and religious adherents alike have long embraced the concept of a unifying non-material energy field, a so-called ‘deep dimension’ to reality – except that scientists have found a rational interpretation for this concept only within the last century while theists have been inspired by such a notion for millennia. Several scientists and philosophers have described this energy in their own individual terms – Bucke by ‘cosmic consciousness’, Jung by ‘collective unconscious’, Sheldrake by ‘morphic field’ and, in philosophy, by Plato with his ‘Forms’ and ‘Ideas’ and Kant’s vision of a world of the ‘phenomenal’ and the ‘noumenal’; it is David Bohm’s ‘implicate order’. ‘The world we observe is illusory, ephemeral, and short-lived, while the deep dimension is real, eternal and eternally unchanging’.I believe Laszlo first introduced his own term, ‘akashic field’, to general readers in his book ‘Science and the Akashic Field’ of a decade ago, though his thoughts had been moving in that direction for at least another decade before that. ‘Akasha’ is a Sanskrit term meaning ‘aether’ or ‘space’ and the concept formed part of ancient Hindu philosophy found in the Upanishads. It is the foundation of the created universe. The akashic record is regarded as the spiritual domain in which all the events of the universe are written through all time. The idea is beautifully summarized on p.2: the akasha is the underlying foundation of the cosmos that creates the conditions for the emergence of life and consciousness; it is complementary to prana – the activating energy.The author states that the more enlightened scientists (especially quantum physicists and biologists) have come to realize that a new paradigm is needed to explain the phenomena of the world at the molecular and organismal level – matter, life and consciousness are all entangled and constantly interactive. Nonlocality or ‘action-at-a-distance’ (two objects influencing one another without any obvious connection between them) is something we are all familiar with in the case of gravity or magnets. But, as Laszlo says, it applies much more widely than that. In the case of consciousness we find it in telepathy and shared death experiences. Furthermore, nonlocality applies across time as well as across space. This cosmic energy field, or akashic field as Laszlo calls it, is like a giant fine web that envelops the whole universe: touch one part, and it all responds – and goes on responding in the holofield through space-time. Matter and minds together form a holistic interactive system; ‘there is no separation between components and their interaction’. Every individual creature is itself an example of coherence within its being.The second part of this book recounts discussions between Laszlo and other proponents of similar ideas, and then spiritually oriented scientists present their take on the akashic field concept in short articles. This book provides a much deeper explanation at a more sophisticated scientific level than Laszlo’s previous book on the akashic field, which could easily be read by non-scientists. I think they would have rather more difficulty understanding the arguments here. In summary, the evolution of this akashic field concept (or whatever other term is used to describe the cosmic spiritual field of the universe) leads to ‘a self-actualizing, self-organizing whole, where each part is in coherence with all others’. As usual, there is a list of References and further reading (somewhat shorter than before) and a useful Index.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XSWEJD1V7SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620552760#wasThisHelpful","R26XSWEJD1V7SG","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Certainty of Eternity by L.C. Danby, White Crow Books, Guildford, UK, 2013, 206 ff.`This book is about Stan Walsh, one of Australia's most respected and talented physical mediums of the early 20th century'. So begins the Foreword to this biography of Walsh -`an ordinary carpenter' - written by L.C. Danby, one of the sitters in the séances that Walsh held in Melbourne in the 1920s and 1930s. In the Foreword, written by Danby's daughter, Jo, she tells us that Danby himself held séances at his home in the 1940s. Expressing reservations about many religions because of the human distortions added to them Jo says: `I especially like the spiritual teachings of the Native American who treat the forests, waterways and the air we breathe with the same reverence as they treat the life force of humans and animals.' In recent decades we have heard the same sentiments expressed by others, notably by the Catholic priest, Fr. Thomas Berry.Many of the events recorded here are expressed in language that reflects that of the Bible, though this is a book about spiritualism not Christianity or Judaism. Walsh, a lifelong bachelor, was born in 1891 in the small township of Ararat in Victoria, Australia. He spent his adult life in Melbourne with his parents and a sister, and left his earthly body in 1939. He called himself a spiritualist at first but later, guided by Spirit, abandoned this description because there were an increasing number of dubious practitioners.Early in the story, Danby describes how a sceptical Walsh was introduced to spiritualism by one of his friends, a Welsh bread-carrier called Herbert Jones and his favourite (inspirational) medium, Mrs Beames. At his first full home séance with Mrs Beames, Walsh found himself the recipient of a series of automatic writings. I found this inauspicious and humble introduction of Walsh's new powers quite engaging.At a subsequent meeting, Walsh was introduced to his spirit guide - an Amerindian called Malocca. Walsh was now set to become a deep-trance medium. Danby is keen to emphasize the difference between mediumship dealing with spiritual matters and materialistic fortune-telling. Walsh, young and inexperienced, at first used his powers for material gain and was rebuked by Malocca for doing so. There is also an interesting incident described that illustrates the `speaking in tongues' referred to in the Bible when another of Walsh's spirit guides spoke to a group of strangers, through Walsh, in their native tongue. And there is a whole chapter given to `the power of thought' - a subject of great current interest with the number of books describing healing by prayer and intention - and others on apports and materializations, and on inspiration.It is clear that many people found the information Walsh brought through from so many spirits inspiring and comforting, as it will be to readers of this book who have an open mind. This is an excellent and uplifting book. My only reservation would be concerning the negation of the possibility of reincarnation - contrary to a huge amount of physical evidence that this does indeed occur. But as a heart-warming story of a humble and gifted man, and in its reassuring insights into the afterworld, this book makes fascinating reading. The book has a very human approach to Walsh's biographical details, which helps the reader to take seriously the sometimes bizarre events in which he was involved.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRXLFOGS4NNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910121347#wasThisHelpful","R1QRXLFOGS4NNU","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beowulf, trans. by Seamus Heaney, Faber & Faber, 2000, 142 ffThis is a story of a Scandinavian prince. It was originally written in Anglo-Saxon or Old English sometime between the 7th and 10th centuries. Beowulf is the principal warrior in the land of the Geats in what is now southern Sweden; his aim is to rid the land of a man-eating monster called Grendel and, in order to do this, he must cross the sea to his lair in Denmark. His story is told both in the original and in this translation in poetic style, but not in the sort of rhyming poetry of Wordsworth or Coleridge. The English lines scan more like Welsh cynghanedd, or the Scandinavian epic Kalevala, or subsequently Longfellow’s story of Hiawatha – but without the strong trochaic rhythm. There is often internal alliteration within or between lines in one verse. Most of the verses have a marginal summary and these carry you through the story even on their own. For those who have read, or are intending to read, the books by Brian Bates – ‘The Real Middle-Earth’ or ‘The Way of Wyrd’ – or for those who have enjoyed the books or films based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, this work is highly recommended as background reading.

Before he can leave, he receives a cable telling him she has married someone else. He decides to fly to San Francisco anyway to see her but the flight is grounded in New Orleans because of a storm. Here, a local reporter covering the airplane story takes him to a local bordello where he is introduced to Jackie Lamont (Deanna Durbin). At the club, Jackie introduces us to the Frank Loesser number ‘Spring will be a little late this year’ and the couple dance to the Gene Depaul and Don Raye tune, ‘I’ll remember April’. Jackie also gets to sing Irving Berlin’s ‘Always’ and we get a couple of brief excerpts of Wagner’s ‘Tristan und Isolde’ – but this is no musical!Charlie takes Jackie to a Christmas Mass at the local cathedral: she becomes upset and she pours out her heart to him. It seems her real name is Abigail Mannette, wife of convicted killer Robert Mannette (Gene Kelly). The couple live with his mother, who knows all about her son’s failings, for Robert is also a compulsive gambler and steals money from his mother.This is a fine example of the genre and I would recommend viewing, quite apart from the pleasure of seeing Kelly and Durbin in dramatic roles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27KC60WFSZYV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NDGX1Y#wasThisHelpful","R27KC60WFSZYV6","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heaven and Hell Unveiled: Updates from the world of spirit, by Stafford Betty, White Crow Books, Guildford, UK, 2014, 170 ff.Stafford Betty, a Professor of Religion at California State University Bakersfield, is a well-known authority on writings about the afterlife. He has already written ‘The Afterlife Unveiled’ and a novel on the same theme, ‘The Imprisoned Splendor’.In the Introduction to this book, Betty warns us that the impressions of ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’ that we receive from western religion are not consistent with what we learn of the afterlife from discarnate spirits communicating through mediums. Chapter 1 tells us of the evidence the author believes testifies to the validity of the source material. He also explains why one account will probably differ in several ways from any other, coloured by the discarnate soul’s life experiences and afterlife location, and the medium’s personality, but that there is an underlying consistency between all of them. It is an encouraging fact that many of these mediums were themselves religious clerics, scientists or philosophers – not men or women easily deceived but needing to guard their professional reputations on Earth.The picture of the Afterworld that Betty paints in Chapter 3 is an encouraging one, though not without its darker side for those still in need of conditioning to the reality of their new home. Chapter 4 on the nature of God brings in views from many names familiar in afterlife exploration, and a different image of the divine from that usually encountered in western religion; God and Creation are revisited in Chapter 6. Chapter 5 gives an interesting contrast of earthly views of the self, derived from philosophers and psychologists, with those of and from spirits.There are two chapters, 2 and 9, that deal with dying and the supposed judgement of the soul that determines our place in the afterlife, while Chapter 10 covers the related subject of karma. Most of the messages indicate that even for evildoers, there is not a lifetime of ‘hell’ to be suffered for all eternity. There is however an intensive period of retraining into an attitude of loving forgiveness rather than ‘corporal’ punishment. In this chapter there is quite a graphic portrait of ‘hell’ experienced by a woman who had plotted deceit on Earth. It is followed by another on the consequences of suicide which does not paint quite the punishing picture portrayed in Betty’s earlier book.The afterlife primarily is an existence of love and service (Chapter 12) – not one of lazing about on beds while handmaidens peel grapes for us! But there is time and opportunity too to engage in activities that we found enjoyable in our time on Earth and overall it is a time of ‘exaltation, ecstasy and endless evolution’. Chapter 13 very usefully puts the prophets, avatars and manifestations of the different religions in perspective so that we can appreciate their true significance, and Chapters 14 and 15 extends this to the role of prayer and worship.Only in the final chapters does the author deal with the dark side of the afterworld and the prospects for reincarnation. There is a list of References and a good Index to complete the book. I have read many books about the afterlife, but still I was delighted to find insights here that I hadn’t met before. It seems that every spirit and every compatible medium have something worthwhile to tell us.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZLTCZI4G7OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910121304#wasThisHelpful","R2UZLTCZI4G7OP","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philosopher’s Toolkit: A compendium of philosophical concepts and methods by Julian Baggini and Peter S. Fosl, Wiley-Blackwell, 2nd edn. 2010, 304 ff.This is a book of fundamentals of philosophy, explicitly written but with subject matter that needs concentrated reading. It is presented throughout in relatively short sections for easier assimilation. For many of these, a few particularly relevant other sections of the work are listed at the end so that the reader can join up his or her thinking with related topics or approaches. Baggini is a British professional writer and Fosl is Professor of Philosophy at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky.There are seven chapters in this book and the first two deal with the devices used in philosophical arguments – like deduction and induction, fallacies and tautologies, analogies and anomalies. Chapter Three is about how we would assess the arguments of others (or what we need to look out for in making arguments of our own) with features like ambiguity, circularity, redundancy and somewhat more challenging features like category mistakes or conceptual incoherence.Chapter Four teaches us how to distinguish between complementary pairs of philosophical concepts – analytic and synthetic, necessary and sufficient properties, objective and subjective arguments, and a whole lot more. In Chapter Five there is a fascinating examination of some of the most famous arguments that were used by philosophers of yesteryear – like Hume’s Fork and Ogham’s Razor.The remaining two chapters are also written in a historical context dealing as they do with the views of some great philosophers of the past – Leibniz, Nietzsche, Sartre, and another more modern French philosopher Jacques Lacan, Gödel, and others. The suggestions for further reading appear at the end of each section, so the book concludes with just a detailed Index. This is an excellent book for serious students of philosophy and, quite apart from those studying the subject per se, it would prove useful to students of English or science who need to develop techniques of presenting coherent arguments.  I have studied philosophy for several decades and I found this a useful addition to my library.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit (2011) and Evolution of Consciousness (2012)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1THPUR29WUV01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405190183#wasThisHelpful","R1THPUR29WUV01","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Afterlife Communication: 16 Proven Methods; 85 True Accounts, R. Craig Hogan (editor), Academy for Spiritual and Consciousness Studies, Loxahatchee, FL, USA, 2014, 320 ff.This edited volume comprises contributions from those who are participants at the ASCS conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, 11-13 July, 2014. But this book is very far from being a dry compilation of Conference Proceedings.Numerous books have been written telling us about the Afterlife and what we can expect when we pass over. Those books that offer the most comfort to relatives currently grieving over recently deceased relatives give detailed descriptions of contact by others with their departed loved ones. These messages also give hope to those who are contemplating what happens after Earthly life has ended and who are unsure or frightened of the future, or even if they have one. Many of the successful communications described here are very moving.The difference with this book, compared with others, is that it is not about just one method of communication with Spirit but many different ways of communicating – through mediums, by self-guided connections, during meditation, by using pendulums; in dreams; through automatic writing; messages received through electronic media (ITC), such as telephone, radio or computer; and other methods. Craig Hogan suggests that people can be trained to contact Spirit though guided meditation. Karen Herrick recounts stories of what might be described as ‘miracles’ where an agency (Karen calls them ‘guardian angels’) intervene by non-material means to prevent a disaster to some individual: why such people should be chosen to be saved is not for us to fathom in this lifetime. Anne and Herb Puryear write about the construction of a Faraday cage to assist in afterlife communication in a simplified psychomanteum.This shows just how flexible Spirit can be so that we have the greatest chance of understanding what passing to Spirit means to us. It also makes the book considerably more interesting than those that deal with only one method of communication, or messages received by just one medium, however insightful they may be.The communications have taken place with varying degrees of ‘reliably obtained’ evidence: some under scientifically rigorous conditions while others have taken place quite naturally in an everyday setting; others fall somewhere in between these two extremes of spiritual communication. However, whether or not these events occur under scientifically rigorous conditions, they involve non-material agencies and it is clear that the information being given is meaningful to the souls on Earth for whom it was meant. Each connection has a personal meaning and a resonance not only with those receiving the messages but, I would suspect, with the readers of this book.Herein is a cornucopia of evidence of the Afterlife, which would be comforting to those who have no difficulty in opening their minds to accept what is freely given but equally could be a starting point for those who are sceptical about this aspect of life here on Earth and its potential connection with another dimension. This is a fascinating, compelling and thoroughly uplifting book with its central message that Spirit is all around us all of the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R113Y3NYR3DJS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0980211174#wasThisHelpful","R113Y3NYR3DJS9","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Your Eternal Self by R. Craig Hogan (ed.), Greater Reality Publications, 2008, 305 ff.This book is presented in short, easy-to-read sections that flow on, one from another. The author has therefore dispensed with an Index but rather lays out the contents of each section in detail at the start. Dr Craig Hogan is a prominent American communicator in disseminating a greater understanding of the spiritual nature of life through his association with learned societies devoted to this theme. Among his activities, he is editor of the book ‘Afterlife Communication’, produced by the Academy for Spiritual and Consciousness Studies.Hogan begins by pointing up the contrast between the satisfaction we feel at our intellectual achievements and the anxiety, stress and discontent we experience from our personal lives. Over the past few decades science has begun to focus seriously on achieving a greater understanding of the role and purpose of human existence in the universe. Where previously a ‘leap of faith’ was required to know anything of what might lie beyond the materialism of our everyday lives, today there is ample empirical evidence to support our role as ‘eternal spiritual beings having a physical experience’ on the Earth plane. This book is about the evidence that supports such as assertion.Chapter 1 presents the evidence provided by a number of experts over several decades that the mind is not ‘simply’ the activity of the brain. Some activities may evoke responses from the brain: but there are others that do not. The chapter includes reference to the author’s own experiences of remote viewing and Kenneth Ring’s study of blind subjects – and of course out-of-body and near-death experiences. There is a fascinating section in this chapter on child prodigies and savants and what their abilities tell us. So if mind isn’t the brain, Where Are You?Chapter 2, What Are You? continues this approach. Many people – especially those who are religious adherents – would say that ‘I’ am not simply my brain or even my whole physical body but essentially that numinous entity we call the ‘soul’. This chapter elaborates on the statement that we are eternal spiritual beings having a physical experience. There are many scientists who believe in God and an afterlife, but who become disquieted by the idea of our soul undergoing numinous psychic experiences. Hogan gives us details of a whole raft of notions that were ridiculed by scientists and the press in their day but which provide a timely warning about rejecting ideas that are imaginative and explanatory – but unconventional. He also tells us about eminent scientists and lawyers who have become convinced of these ideas by the physical evidence.We are now more than half-way through the book. The remaining eight chapters elaborate on these two themes with a huge amount of empirical evidence. At the end of the book there is a comprehensive list of References and a Bibliography so that readers can follow up on any of the subjects discussed. With such a detailed Contents list, there is no Index.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit (2011) and Evolution of Consciousness (2012).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZVPI457H8GDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0980211107#wasThisHelpful","R2ZVPI457H8GDA","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Humanism: A Very Short Introduction by Stephen Law, Oxford University Press, 2011,168 ff.As might be expected the author, who is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Heythrop College of the University of London, begins by explaining the term ‘humanism’ in the context of this book. On the one hand, humanism may mean simply putting the welfare of humans at the forefront of our philosophy of life: such humanists may very well also be theists or deists. A more restrictive view of humanism is that of the Renaissance that swept aside the view of the Church as authority on all matters, spiritual and temporal, to be replaced by Protagoras’ view that ‘Man is the measure of all things’. Law comments: ‘personally, I would rather see the world as it is, than as I might like it to be’. This statement echoes the words of Carl Sagan, another humanist: ‘It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring’.This is the line followed by the author. Such humanists are unbelieving, or at least sceptical, of the existence of gods or an afterlife so are almost invariably atheists. Those beliefs that are, or need not be, part of humanist belief are laid out very clearly in the introductory chapter. Law then goes on in Chapter 1 to explore the history of humanism, from the ideas of ancient China, India and Greece, through the Renaissance and Enlightenment, up to the views of 20th Century humanists like Bertrand Russell and Peter Singer. Chapters 2 and 3 then discuss arguments for and against the existence of God: these are good but I think Mackie’s book ‘The Miracle of Theism’ is more detailed and therefore more informative. There is an excellent discussion in the next chapter of humanism and morality and how belief in a god is unnecessary to inspire a moral life. Then in Chapter 5 we have what might be considered at first sight a surprising interpretation of secularism – not that every individual should be non-religious but that the State should uphold freedom of the individual to follow whatever beliefs they choose, without any coercion.This leads on in the final chapters to a discussion of religious indoctrination of children, supporting the Dawkins view of the practice as child abuse, and how humanism, even in the absence of belief in God, can still lead to a moral society, and one that is by no means without purpose for the individuals in it. The book ends with short sections of References, Further Reading and an Index. This is an excellent introduction to the subject.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of ConsciousnessSome reviewers have criticised this book for its emphasis on attacking religion. But one of the goals of humanism is precisely to provide a basis for morality and to give life a purpose - without all the falsehoods of religion. I do not find the arguments here unhelpful in that regard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QTLXPB3SPDFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199553645#wasThisHelpful","R3QTLXPB3SPDFH","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atheism by Julian Baggini, A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2003, 136 ffThe author begins by describing the aura of the negative and sinister that his childhood Catholic indoctrination has left with him in regard to atheism. Although he has consciously rejected the fabric of religion, still his subconscious cannot entirely dispel the sense of evil that he was taught to associate with atheism. So his book is a rational exploration of the true philosophical status of atheism.Believing there is no God does not imply that there is no such thing as morality or goodness or that life has no purpose, says the author. Belief in atheism usually carries with it a rejection of all things spiritual, like psychic events or any kind of afterlife – a belief in the natural world (naturalism or materialism) but not in the supernatural. This does not however make the atheist a nihilist – disbelieving in all non-material entities, like mind; atheists are simply realists. Baggini suggests that ‘all the strong evidence tells in favour of atheism, and only weak evidence tells against it.’The fact that there is ‘a plethora of evidence for the truth of naturalism’ does not necessarily imply that there is not additionally a spiritual agency outside of the material natural world [HAJ] – for the author, naturalism implies atheism. To Baggini, human beings are just ‘animals’ and ‘our capacity for consciousness . . . is entirely dependent on our organic brains’. Empirical evidence of near-death experiences and other psychic phenomena clearly undermines this assertion, though the author relegates these to the ‘extremely weak evidence’ category, all such evidence being dismissed and dumped into the dustbin of unreliability – because we do not have the time to check all the cases! Any concordance between such events and reality is pure chance, he says. The principle of induction also supports atheism – because no-one can ever be said to have seen God.Chapters 3 and 4 of the book deal with the consequences of atheism to morality and ethics, and to our sense of the purpose of life. I would agree with the author that a belief in atheism is irrelevant to both. We need nothing more than humanism to engender our morality and to give meaning to our lives. Baggini agrees that morality is ‘entirely independent’ of God. Similarly with meaning or purpose: the ‘purpose’ of a knife is to cut things – but that purpose is created by the manufacturer and the user, not by the knife. So unless we are playthings created by our God for his amusement, we cannot rely on God to define our purpose in life – our purpose must lie within ourselves.The final chapters give a brief overview of the history of atheism, and a commentary on the atheist view of religion. Baggini believes that atheism ‘emerged from the rejection of myth’, which he considers a good thing. But myths are alive and well in our society today and again often have nothing to do with the God of western religion.There is a brief Bibliography and an Index at the end. This is an interesting little monograph for those who want to explore atheism from a philosophical standpoint, but I cannot see it converting anyone.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit and Evolution of Consciousness","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPV8ENMXDEMOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0192804243#wasThisHelpful","RPV8ENMXDEMOY","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diarmuid O’Murchu, God in the Midst of Change: Wisdom for confusing times, Maryknoll, N.Y., Orbis Books, 2012, 196pp. ISBN 978 1 62698 041 9The metaphor of the opening sentence sets the tone for this book: ‘Millions of people have their heads buried in the quick sands of our changing world’. Life has become so complex; the pace of life has become so fast and the extent of change so far-reaching; and whatever political party we vote for, we can have little influence on any of the factors that shape our daily lives. For many, the turmoil is just too much to face up to, so they shut down mentally and perhaps opt out practically – they live their lives in a state of denial. To counter this fear and apathy, the author is suggesting we put our faith in the wisdom of the creation itself with a Divine creativity as its central inspiration.The first of the three parts of this book deals with the distortions, the misrepresentations and misinterpretations of the pillars of present-day western society. As a result, these foundations - like the Bible - are now considered to be without meaning or purpose. The second part deals with the chaos that many feel surrounds their everyday lives and which leaves many people feeling disempowered, dislocated and disillusioned. This part of the book opens with an assessment of the impact of computer technology and the effects of our plundering of the Earth, and ends with a dire warning of potential human extinction if we do not mend our ways. We can no longer rely on the ‘God of the Gaps’ to save us!The third part of the book is an exhortation to put our trust in the existence and wisdom of the evolving Cosmic Spirit – in other words, God. The author wants the reader to extend their horizons of vision further back in time than just the 2000 years of Christianity, and further out into the cosmos than just human happenings on Earth. O’Murchu is encouraging us to rekindle the close association with the Earth we experienced in an earlier and less sophisticated age, as has been advocated over the past few decades by Fr. Thomas Berry – a move towards the more animistic pagan beliefs and those of the East. The world is increasingly rejecting the capitalist, colonialist past of the west – this patriarchal will-to-power to borrow a term from Nietzsche – and is increasingly embracing a more spiritual outlook. O’Murchu sees the concept of the autocratic sky-god at the heart of western religion as part of this patriarchal attitude.Throughout the book O’Murchu is advocating an individual spirituality to replace authoritarian religion and seeing ourselves as part of an organic Earth, metaphorically represented by James Lovelock’s Gaia. Greater conscious collaboration between humans is our contribution to Gaia. He does however, disturbingly, believe that Earth is a source of abundant (and therefore, by implication, inexhaustible) resources: we need only to re-structure our economic systems of distribution and there will be enough for all. Other than the author’s fellow Catholics, I suspect there are few who would agree with this stance. I was relieved to see however that he dismisses the ‘original sin’ myth. O’Murchu sees the exploitation by humans of one another and of the environment as symptoms of stunted sexual maturity.The third and final part of the book uses quantum interaction as a metaphor for the shift in consciousness that humankind now needs for survival. Happily, O’Murchu rejects the materialistic view of consciousness expressed by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett in favour of a more spiritual interpretation.This an interesting and excellent thought-provoking book, the contents of which I suspect conservative Christians will find it hard to accept but which liberalists should welcome.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit (2011) and Evolution of Consciousness (2012).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQAETZNFS0Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626980411#wasThisHelpful","R1KQAETZNFS0Q0","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Presentation Lab: Learn the formula behind powerful presentations by Simon Morton, Wiley, Chichester, 2014, 254 ppI have spent my whole professional life giving ‘presentations’ – as a teacher, lecturer and in business. Anyone who has to spend a significant portion of their lives giving information to other people will find a mine of helpful detail in this book. Some of the material can be found in any authoritative book on management techniques – few people get to be real managers nowadays (as opposed to simply having a morale-boosting but vacuous title) without having staff to control and instruct, either formally or informally. Any teacher-training course will also include some of this material.As I read through this, I was struck by the fact that even as a writer I would have found this book helpful if it had been available to me earlier in my life. The emphasis, as might be expected, is on presentations given in a commercial business environment using PowerPoint – but many lecturers I have had to listen to would have benefited enormously (or at least I and the rest of the audience would have benefited enormously) if some of the basic principles given here had been followed. There is however no instruction on how to manipulate PowerPoint itself – that can be found in other books.As would be expected for a book on ‘presentation’ written by an expert in this field, the design of the book is attractive and easily accessible to readers, even to those who might think the subject material rather ‘dry’. I am no expert in new technology but I found the text quite accessible, and there are lots of illustrations. The nub of the argument is that speakers should try to become part of the audience as far as they can rather than staying aloof. Make your talk a story as far as you can. The text is all in non-technical language and there is a useful Index at the end, with a handful of suggestions for further reading.

"Natural Selection & Beyond: The intellectual legacy of Alfred Russel Wallace, edited by Charles H. Smith and George Beccaloni, Oxford University Press, 2008, 510 ffAn in-depth look at the oft-neglected discoverer of evolutionWhen we talk about evolution, we usually think in terms of the work of Charles Darwin. But there was another scientist thinking along the same lines at the same time as Darwin and that was the Welsh-born biologist Alfred Russel Wallace. Furthermore, Darwin and Wallace were not even the first to address the problem as, half a century earlier, Charles’ grandfather Erasmus Darwin and the French biologist Jean Baptiste Lamarck produced their own theories of how life on Earth developed.This volume has contributions from twenty-three specialists in their fields, as well as the two editors, to recount the work of Wallace, not only as a biologist but also as a passionate socialist and investigator of spiritualism. As historian of science Peter Bowler comments in his Foreword, Wallace not only made major contributions to evolutionary biology but also, in both his biology and spiritualism, showed his opposition to the materialism of mainstream Victorian culture.Although Darwin trained to be a priest in the Anglican Church, his approach to evolution was essentially materialistic with no mention of any possible divine intervention in the process. Wallace on the other hand did not exclude the possibility of some non-material agency in shaping the course of evolution.In this book, Normal Johnson tells us something about Wallace’s concept of reinforcement as he saw it operating in the natural world. Tim Caro and colleagues writes on the colours of animals. Bernard Michaux gives a good account of Wallace’s biogeographical studies in the Far East that produced what came to be called the Wallace Line in Indonesia. And some of what are now regarded as misdirections in Wallace’s work are also covered – like his campaign against vaccination (by Martin Fichman), and his equivocal view of Francis Galton’s advocacy of eugenics.There is not a lot written here on Wallace’s interest in spiritualism – of importance to the man himself in his lifetime and in the early years of the 20th century but probably of much less significance in comparison with his evolutionary studies and conclusions. Overall, this is a book for the reader who wants to have a serious grounding in what the life and work of this great man was all about. The book ends with a 40-page list of References and a useful Index.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQ6Z7QLMIOUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199239177#wasThisHelpful","RSQ6Z7QLMIOUU","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alfred Russel Wallace: a rediscovered life by Michael A. Flannery, Discovery Institute Press, Seattle, Washington, 2011, 166 ff.Michael Flannery is Professor and Associate Director for Historical Collections at the Lister Hill Library of the Health Sciences, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama in the U.S.A. He has written here a most readable and accessible introduction to the life and work of a great naturalist , whose work has tended to be overlooked by the general public in favour of Wallace’s contemporary, friend and rival, Charles Darwin. The arguments go on as to whether Darwin or Wallace should be credited with creating the theory of evolution; but the documents of scientific history show us that both men were proposing similar – but far from identical – views about the origin of species at the same time and it seems obvious that each developed ideas from the work of the other.It is often said that Wallace has been relatively neglected in the story of scientific developments because in later years he took an interest in spiritualism, long derided as fantasy and fiction by much of the scientific establishment. But, as Flannery has so eloquently shown, the processes of evolution as described by Darwin and by Wallace differ in a fundamental and significant way. Although Darwin trained to be an Anglican priest in his early years, his description of evolution envisages a thoroughgoing materialism in the process. Wallace on the other hand adopted a more teleological approach. Darwin had the advantages of a full schooling and study at two eminent universities, Edinburgh and Cambridge, while Wallace had only eight years of formal schooling and was largely self-taught. Darwin’s family were financially secure while Wallace had to be withdrawn from school because of the family’s financial hardship.Flannery sets out the backgrounds of the two men and explains in this short book how their views of evolution differ. Without any religious hyperbole about Wallace’s ideas on ‘intelligent evolution’, Flannery interprets Wallace’s writings in a very measured way and shows their significance for readers interested as much as anything in the human side of the story and without any detail of the biology for non-scientists. He compares Wallace’s approach not only with Darwin’s but also in the context of the current so-called ‘intelligent design’ movement.

"Quantum Jumps: an extraordinary science of happiness and prosperity, by Cynthia Sue Larson, 2013, 286 ff.The opening paragraph of Larson’s book presents us with a profound truism – one that an increasing number of people are embracing but also one that so many people either ignore or are too apprehensive to acknowledge: ‘A new Quantum Age is upon us . . . In this new Quantum Age, our experience of reality is transformed when we acknowledge that we are all connected – and that at any given moment, there exists an infinite number of possibilities’. There is in science an idea that there might exist ‘many worlds’ – a whole galaxy of universes. I have long believed that these ‘many worlds’ are virtual, that is, they consist of the realm of all the possibilities of thoughts and actions that humankind had available to them though human history – a kind of cosmic akashic field or, to put it another way, an assemblage in fact of ‘quantum jumps’. This is the author’s message here. At the outset Cynthia, who has a degree in physics from the University of California at Berkeley, describes a similar picture using two of the fundamental principles of quantum physics – potentiality and interconnection. The opening chapters of the book explain in completely non-technical language the relevance and application of these ideas from quantum physics in our everyday lives – we don’t have to be quantum physicists or working in a laboratory to see and feel these ideas in practice. Technical ideas like coherence, tunnelling, entanglement and superposition are all explained with their everyday relevance to us. We can begin to improve our health instantaneously by focussing our minds – what medics describe as the placebo effect. Spiritual healers do not have to be at the bedside of their patients but are able to transmit their beneficent thoughts to their patients remotely – just as the interactions of the subatomic entities of matter are able to transgress the restrictions of space and time. To the creative writer or composer – or scientist or mathematician – the ‘quantum jump’ is that moment of inspiration when the subconscious mind tunes in to the cosmic energy and a great new book, poem, symphony or theory comes into physical existence. After the simplified scientific stuff, the author goes on to suggest ways these ideas can be used to change the present and future of our lives. Larson echoes the importance of the power of intention that several other authors have written about in the last two decades. Each chapter of the book describes a number of exercises that readers can carry out by applying the principles of what has just been described. I have read many technical papers and popular books about quantum physics. Unfortunately, as Larry Dossey has pointed out, the word ‘quantum’ has become hackneyed because in recent years it has been overused by ‘New Age’ gurus who clearly had no real understanding of its significance. But here, we have a book that is precisely about quantum jumps in our everyday lives – but it has taken a physicist to use the term in its entirely proper context. That she is also blessed with a spiritual outlook makes the book doubly valuable.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness, and other books","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQ7RMAVUNXM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0971934959#wasThisHelpful","R3KQ7RMAVUNXM7","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seeding of clouds with dry ice or silver iodide has been used for many years to produce rainfall artificially. This sci-fi film is about an experiment to use 2000 drones to create the clouds themselves, seed them with silver iodide and then have the drones recharge themselves automatically by drawing in atmospheric carbon dioxide and freezing it to dry ice. The drones drift in the upper atmosphere to a new location and then start the process all over again. Unfortunately, they are a little too successful and start producing mini ice tornados in one location after another in north-western USA. Frank (Robert Moloney) is the coordinating bureaucrat behind the project and the guy who puts up the money. Once the experiment is underway they find its effects are dramatic and fatal but the scientists in the field are powerless to moderate it. Meanwhile former scientist turned sci-fi author Charlie Price (whose has just had a signing locally for his latest novel) gets drawn in to the impending disaster. It's not a great movie but the special effects are quite good and it's an entertaining enough film using a piece of nearly believable science when actual highly damaging hailstorms with tennis-ball sized hailstones have become a reality of our present-day weather.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ONB2B2W95XJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031545T8#wasThisHelpful","R3ONB2B2W95XJ6","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emilie Janzen (Deedee Pfeiffer) is a normal housewife separated from her husband Richard (Matthew Harrison) but living with their two children - Lori (Tegan Moss) and Kevin (Brett Dier). Emilie is normal - but has quite useful psychic flashes periodically. Lori, like any gorgeous, attractive 17-year-old, has boys in school who have crushes on her; Lori's favourite at the moment is Curt (Jared Keeso). When Lori goes to a party at a girlfriend's house and doesn't come home after having had an argument with her mother earlier in the evening, Emilie starts to get worried. She quizzes Curt and his father, but Curt denies knowing anything about what has happened to Lori, though he admits that he and Lori had a fight. Emilie decides to go to the police who, at first, are dismissive, regarding Lori's behaviour as typical teenage rebellion. It emerges that Lori's disappearance is a lot more serious than anyone at first thought and how they manage to track her down makes for an intriguing story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGY7NBEPWU3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061BEATY#wasThisHelpful","RHGY7NBEPWU3D","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Gale had previously been accused of the rape of a former student, Berlin (Rhona Mitra), although he was subsequently cleared. Gale secures a huge fee from a magazine to give a series of three two-hour interviews on the last three days of his life with one of their successful investigative journalists, Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet). The story is therefore told retrospectively and Bloom uncovers increasing amounts of evidence to suggest that Gale is innocent.

"The Sense of Being Stared At, and other aspects of the extended mind, by Rupert Sheldrake, Hutchinson, 2003, 384 ffIn this book, author Rupert Sheldrake makes the case for regarding phenomena such as telepathy and premonition as perfectly normal human faculties rather than paranormal or supernatural events. He suggests that minds - and the human mind especially - may extend far beyond the confines of the brain. Sheldrake was formerly a Professor of Biology at the University of Cambridge and is now a Fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences in California.He begins his discussion here by showing how science continually develops with new discoveries and new ideas. He describes what is often called extrasensory perception (ESP) as the seventh sense, maintaining that the ability to detect electromagnetic fields by animals should be called the `sixth sense'. He also regards personal experiences as valid evidence for the existence of these phenomena - after all, readings of ammeters and spectrophotometers have also to be made and recorded by human observations, and the fields of law and medicine rely heavily on personal accounts. Darwin's evidence for the law of evolution came largely from personal anecdotes. Sheldrake has done for `seventh sense' observations what marine biologist Alister Hardy did for spiritual experiences. The mind may be centred in the brain, but it is not confined to it.So much for the Introduction: in the opening chapters of Part I Sheldrake gives many examples of telepathy, often between family members or, he suggests, between those playing team sports. He reviews some of the early work on psychic experiences by scientists in the 19th century. Of course, telepathic interaction with animals is included in this section. Entomologist William Morton Wheeler suggested a similar explanation for communication within communities of social insects, schools of fish or flocks of birds. This is discussed in a later chapter in this section, though Wheeler's name is not mentioned. This phenomenon leads Sheldrake to conclude that `the psyche is not confined to the body during life'.In Part II, The Power of Attention, we begin with a chapter on `The Sense of Being Stared At'. While many of the accounts are anecdotal, there are results given also of statistically significant organized surveys, and a refutation of standard arguments against significance that such `feelings' are examples of paranoia, arise from reasons other than visual focus, such as movement in the subject, or are statistically insignificant in comparison with the number of occasions when no such awareness arises. This kind of sensitivity is clearly important for animals for self-preservation, and for humans in wild territory inhabited by predatory animals, and Sheldrake covers these situations in one of the following chapters, including research by himself and others. As with other forms of telepathy, the results are most convincing when subject and starer have some kind of emotional rapport.An accurate interpretation of the nature of vision has been a challenge to philosophers and physiologists for over 2000 years: Sheldrake reviews the evidence and provides a theory of his own of `the extended mind'. This leads us on to Part III on Remote Viewing and the experiences that some people have of events occurring at a different (past or future) time or in a different place. Part of Sheldrake's evidence for this lies in the senses that many species of animals have of catastrophic natural events, like earthquakes, tsunami or volcanic eruptions, but there are several accounts of human premonitions of disaster too. This leads on to Part IV which explores possible rationally coherent explanations of how the `seventh sense' might work. There are copious Notes, a Bibliography of further reading and a good Index to complete the book.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of ConsciousnessThe Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Memory of NatureThe Science Delusion","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TNU7F73O7YRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620550970#wasThisHelpful","R2TNU7F73O7YRY","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is on an illicit mission in Ethiopia with a fellow sniper, but as the US military are not supposed to be there, their military support is withdrawn leaving them to their own devices. Swagger's comrade is killed in action but he escapes - to retire from the U.S. Marines to live in peace in the country. He's then approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to plan an assassination attempt on the president, on the pretext that they want to know how a real assassin would set about it. In reality, Johnson and his corrupt colleagues, under the control of Senator Charles F. Meachum (Ned Beatty), want to assassinate an archbishop from Ethiopia, appearing on the platform with the president, because the archbishop is in America to expose atrocities by the U.S. military in his country.  With an all-too-familiar conspiracy plot, Swagger is made the fall-guy for the archbishop's assassination and is hunted down by Johnson. But an FBI agent, Nick Memphis (Michael Peña) who becomes suspicious of the frame-up joins sides with Swagger and the two of them see that justice prevails. As part of the conspirators plot, they also capture Swagger's girl-friend, Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara), who has also to be rescued by Swagger and Memphis.

"Music & Silence by Rose Tremain, Chatto and Windus, 1999, 462 ffThe story is that of the court of King Christian IV of Denmark in the 17th century. Christian's reign lasted nearly sixty years, from 1588 (when he was only 11, though he was not crowned until he was 19) until his death in 1648. He had his court musicians housed in his cellar so that they were heard but not seen. The structural order of the music provided by his orchestra - and most notably by the handsome lutenist Peter Claire - is a metaphor for the order Christian would like to see in his household and in Danish society in general. The Court as a whole is a picture of the harmony and discord reflected in the music.Another main character in the story is the King's consort Kirsten with her amorous adventures: Kirsten hates music and the pleasure it gives her husband - she would undoubtedly prefer silence. Kirsten is a selfish, malicious and spiteful woman who hates to see others deriving any pleasure from life. The story is peppered with real characters of the time, such as English composer John Dowland who served at the Danish court as composer-lutenist for eight years from 1598; and Tycho Brahe the famous contemporary astronomer who served also as augur, as was customary in those days. These references and other details add to the authentic atmosphere of this story of historical fiction. The first half of the story moves along quite slowly in segments devoted to each of the principal characters but is infused with quite a lot of humour; then the tale gathers momentum and becomes more engrossing. I certainly felt immersed in this aristocratic world of the time and Tremain is an entertaining writer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ONQPHBRE5Z4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743418263#wasThisHelpful","R1ONQPHBRE5Z4C","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Other tracks were new to me when I bought the CD but I have come to know and love them since. All the pieces are from the medieval or Baroque periods - Bach, Handel, Purcell, Dowland, Arne, Vivaldi and reaching back to Hildegard von Bingen.

"Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is an author suffering from writers' block after discovering his wife Amy (Maria Bello) in bed with another man at a motel. He retreats to their cabin in the woods in search of inspiration when a mysterious stranger, John Shooter (John Turturro), turns up and accuses Rainey of plagiarism. Shooter leaves a copy of his short story `Sowing Season' with Rainey who is surprised to find it does indeed strongly resemble a story of his own, `Secret Window'. The title refers to a window in their cabin beneath which his wife was to have planted a flower bed so that she could look out on it. Rainey then finds his dog has been killed (obviously suspecting Shooter) so reports this to the local sheriff, Dave Newsome (Len Cariou), who isn't really interested. So Rainey decides to visit the home he shared with Amy to recover the original MS. Unfortunately, the house is burnt down and Raney's original MS is lost in the flames. Raney suspects that all these incidents have been caused by Amy's new boyfriend, Ted Milner (Timothy Hutton). So he hires an old friend of his, Ken Karsch (Charles S. Dutton) to investigate. When Rainey gets back to the cabin he finds Ken and the only witness that Shooter even exists killed. The story is a bit involved but it's quite a gripping plot, extremely well-acted by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast, based on a book by Stephen King, and with the movie directed by David Koepp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0NX1NKD4C3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002234LS#wasThisHelpful","R1L0NX1NKD4C3M","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone is Right: A new look at comparative religion and its relation to science by Roland Peterson, DeVorss Publications, 1986, 320 ff.The author is an electrical engineer who has served in senior management positions of several American companies. In this book he develops a world-view drawn from studies in physics and psychology on the one hand, and from the insight of esotericism on the other.Part 1, occupying more than one-half of the book, gives us A Comparison of Religious Thinking, which comprises a survey of some of the main features of the religions of East and West. This is an impressive section: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism are all explored. The material is displayed mostly in a two-column comparative format and the whole is interspersed with quotations from the Bible, Koran, Upanishads and the works of many poets. This is one of the most accessible presentations of comparisons of these religions that I have come across and, considering its relative brevity, contains a great deal of readily accessible information. Also in this section there are 20 pages devoted to religious views of reincarnation and immortality.Part 2 of the book deals with Science and Religion and includes a 14-page section on astrology, but it opens with a short chapter on `Differences and their Resolution'. The resolution Peterson proposes is indicated by the title of the book - that all religions of both East and West have a degree of truth within them but that the scriptures have to be interpreted allegorically and not literally if they are to be compatible with current scientific thought. There is a survey of modern physics, discussion of spiritual healing and other psychic phenomena, a dozen pages on psychology, and even a short section on astrology. Overall, I think the way Peterson has blended in the work of Capra with Jung, LeShan with Erich Fromm, and the New Testament with Hindu scriptures is masterly.There is a short Summary constituting Part 3, and a Bibliography to end the book. This is unquestionably one of the best books I have read to really inter-relate science and scripture, so for those interested in this field I would have no problem recommending it.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of Consciousness","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QLE9K1GP3924/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0875165656#wasThisHelpful","R1QLE9K1GP3924","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is no Commentary in this collection on the man or his work, but it provides a comprehensive overview of Thomas' poetry with over four hundred examples, steeped in the Wales he knew all of his life.

Then a couple of guys from the FBI start taking an interest in him and McDeere learns that two others met with a similar fate a few years ago. This creates disquiet for the McDeeres. The FBI then make McDeere an offer that leaves him between a rock and a hard place. They want him to be a mole and report what goes on in the office, but if he decides to work with the FBI, his career is finished and he will have to relocate under the witness protection program. If Mitch doesn't cooperate with the FBI, then when they take down the firm, he will be indicted and serve a long prison sentence.McDeere decides to hire a P.I.

"Of the 20th century Romantic piano concertos, that by John Ireland, composed in 1930 is not often heard in public performance or on record. This is a pity because it is a fine work with a unique beauty of sound in its melodies and harmonies. The concerto was written for the young pianist Helen Perkin, who gave the first performance, also in 1930. If there are any parallels to be made in the sound world of the work it would surely be with the G Major Piano Concerto of Ravel. The soloist is a pianist well-known for his association with the piano works of English composers - Eric Parkin.The concerto takes up nearly half the playing time of this Chandos CD and the other half is divided between two orchestral tone poems by Ireland: Legend for Piano and Orchestra and the Symphonic Rhapsody, Mai-Dun. In 1906 Ireland had met the Welsh writer Arthur Machen and this meeting inspired Ireland to explore the scenery and literature of Wales. The Legend is dedicated to Machen, though its composition was inspired by the scenery of the Sussex Downs, where Ireland lived for some time, and in part by Machen's short story, `The Happy Children'. The title Mai-Dun is taken from Thomas Hardy for a medieval hill-fort near Dorchester that Hardy described in `The Mayor of Casterbridge'. The atmospheric orchestral playing on this CD is provided by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Bryden Thomson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZ0RQUB0R6QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AEG#wasThisHelpful","R1HZ0RQUB0R6QU","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all the glossy, bloody war films in full Technicolor, made in the past couple of decades, it's good to be able to see again some of the gritty black-and-white war films. As with many Hitchcock thrillers, war films in b/w seem to have that extra realism. This is one of several that John Wayne starred in and there are plenty of authentic looking battle action scenes mixed with a dash of personal psychology and love interest. This movie, made in 1949, directed by Allan Dwan is set in the Pacific theatre. If you are a fan of war films, this is a good one to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29B6MXYNBJ4GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0782010040#wasThisHelpful","R29B6MXYNBJ4GX","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eve Pretson (Emmanuelle Vaugier) is a TV reporter from KQAP who seeks out eccentrics to make fun of them on her show for `entertainment'. She goes out with her cameraman to interview retired MIT research scientist, Ned Larfield (Michel Perron), who has invented a new kind of solar-powered automobile. He doesn't know that the patent officer handling his claim is corrupt and has shredded his application, deleting all records from the computer. Horrified bosses of an energy supply firm are determined to stop his invention being patented at all costs. Their hit men run Eve and her cameraman off the road and Eve is thrown clear but loses her memory. They then go back to Larfield's home, kill him and destroy his invention. Eve finds in her pocket a business card with the time for an interview for her next subject exposé - a self-styled motivational psychiatrist, Dr. Harry Griggs (Anthony Lemke). She keeps her appointment with him at a local hotel, though she has no idea who she is, having suffered memory loss at the accident. Now the hit men are after both of them, and the chase makes for quite an exciting story, though the direction by Philippe Gagnon was loose and sloppy. Considering Eve is out to do a hatchet job on Griggs' professional reputation, he is surprisingly easy to win over, even with Vaugier looking as gorgeous as she does. I didn't find the energy company's determination to eliminate the competition at all implausible, though I would have thought they would have found it more profitable to buy up the patent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNLXJJ0JB5O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YME3KY#wasThisHelpful","R1NNLXJJ0JB5O5","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems to be a remake of the film made in the 1950s with Spencer Tracy starring called Bad Day at Black Rock. William Macpherson (Val Kilmer), a disabled veteran, has had enough of killing as a marine in Iraq and, after the war, goes back to the States and tries to look up his old Mexican buddy, Miguel Silva. The ranch in Arizona where he was living is now a building site run by a bunch of white supremacists, headed by John Rhodes (Gary Cole) who are intent on ridding America of `foreign' immigrants. Macpherson soon meets up with Rhodes' girl Joanna (Jennifer Esposito) and it's made clear to him that he's not wanted in town. First they ask him nicely to leave - but then things get a bit more heated and he has to take on all of Rhodes' cronies nearly single-handed. An exciting action-packed film but little in the way of plot development.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5QTD6EONSAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011VIO4G#wasThisHelpful","R3A5QTD6EONSAH","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of a number of recordings that the late Sir Colin Davis made with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and a quite splendid array of principal soloists. The two- disc opens with tenor Giuseppe Sabbatini singing a short aria as Faust. The orchestra make a fine job of the Hungarian March that concludes Part I. The bass Michele Pertusi is sufficiently menacing as Mephistopheles, who plays a significant role in Part II. Marguerite (mezzo Enkelejda Shkosa) appears in the Part III on disc 2. I have heard more captivating Margueritas but tonally the singing is fine. And the final soloist is the student Brander, also sung here by a bass, David Wilson-Johnson. Overall, I found this to be a fairly satisfying performance, though it never came alive for me; it was released in 2002 on the LSO's own record label.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UWRKXHL17SJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063DQ9#wasThisHelpful","R1UWRKXHL17SJW","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leap of Perception by Penney Peirce, Atria Books, New York, 2013, 350 ff.This is a self-help book. The author's idea is to encourage readers to tune in to a more intuitive and spiritual way of living. The quotations throughout the book that one reviewer found so irritating are in fact valuable milestones along the path that Peirce is trying to lead us down - inspired sayings by acknowledged masters of the spiritual, like Carl Jung, Fr. Bede Griffiths, and Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Cardin, who was both a mystical priest and a scientist.This book by Peirce is the last in an `unexpected' trilogy - a trio of books that the author set about writing without knowing at the outset where the story would take her. This is the first book of hers I have read; perhaps it would have been an advantage to have read parts 1 and 2 of the trilogy, `The Intuitive Way' and `Frequency', first but I settled easily enough into the story even starting here. But then she herself says: `I've occasionally woven together bits of explanation from the two previous books', so perhaps reading them first is not essential.The message of this book is, by now, a familiar one: there have very many books written over the past two or three decades that encouraged or reported a fundamental shift in the consciousness of humankind towards a more spiritual and less materialistic attitude to our lives with greater concern for the environment of the Earth of which we are a part. Some of these books have been rational and scientific (Rachel Carson; Thom Hartmann, Lester R. Brown) warning us of the dire consequences if we continue to desecrate our environment. Others have been more spiritual in their approach (Aldous Huxley; Teilhard de Chardin; Willis Harman). But the `bottom line' is always essentially the same - that our future is in our hands and it is up to us to adopt the mind-set that secures our future.So this is what this book is about - encouraging and guiding us down a path of greater spiritual involvement with one another and with our earthly environment. The message is expressed in terms of the higher vibrational frequencies of energy that living spiritually demands. This is achieved by focussing on the moment (as recommended by Eckhart Tolle and eastern mystical philosophy) and making your conscious mind aware of your environment - living in what Peirce calls the `being' state of the soul. There are mind-training exercises and a short summary with each chapter. I didn't personally relate to the `spherical-holographic' metaphor in Peirce - it reminded me too much of Ken Wilber's `Four Quadrants' concept, making the simple unnecessarily complicated. But overall this is an excellent book with a very important message for the wellbeing of humankind. The book concludes with a brief set of notes, and a glossary of terms, but no index - not that one is really needed here.Howard Jones is the author of Evolution of ConsciousnessCosmic ConsciousnessGlobal Mind Change: The Promise of the 21st CenturyThe Phenomenon of ManThe Perennial Philosophy: An Interpretation of the Great Mystics, East and West (P.S.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RD1YKJL4MRZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582703906#wasThisHelpful","R3RD1YKJL4MRZI","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an atmospheric thriller set in 19th century Vienna, as spiritualism was beginning to take hold. Young Eisenheim and Sophie are childhood sweethearts, but are separated as their parents part to lead their respective lives. Years later, Eisenheim becomes a respected stage illusionist (now played by Edward Norton) with Josef Fisher (Eddie Marsan) as his manager, while Sophie (now played by Jessica Biel) becomes a countess. As such, she is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), but, when she meets up with Eisenheim again, she yearns to be with him. But Leopold apparently kills her to prevent her joining Eisenheim. Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) threatens to arrest Eisenheim for fomenting dissent against the monarchy but when he confronts Leopold over Sophie's murder, the Crown Prince shoots himself. But the story is far from over and we do not know till the end how much is real and how much is illusion. The movie is well directed by Neil Burger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0HT98NMR8CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K7VHQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0HT98NMR8CI","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on real-life events, this movie gives an account of the impact on the personal lives of those involved of the WMD episode in the Bush administration. President Bush Jr. was so obsessed with invading Iraq to finish the war that his father had started that he fabricated the story that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. CIA operative Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) is sent to Iraq under cover to find out the truth. She persuades several of the Iraqi physicists involved in the program to defect to America. She makes it clear back home however that there are no WMD. Her partner, Joe Wilson (Sean Penn), writes a newspaper article about the fiasco but in return the administration discloses Valerie's identity and the nature of her mission. The Iraqi physicists are abandoned to their fate in Iraq and they are rounded up and executed. The chief `hawk' in the administration is Scooter Libby (David Andrews) who subsequently stands trial for his part in the fabrication, and is sentenced, but has his sentence revoked by the president. The movie is an exciting dramatization of events, directed by Doug Liman. This deplorable story has been told in print by those concerned: `Fair Game' by Valerie Plame Wilson and `the Politics of Truth' by Joe Wilson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0F55TW3LPMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IFYMWK#wasThisHelpful","RY0F55TW3LPMG","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But one of those who threaten him accidentally gets killed and Yale is forced to bury the body - in `the square': this is a patch of land that is about to be filled with concrete as part of a building project, but the Australian rainy season comes early and concreting is delayed.

"Celtic Mythology and Religion by Alexander Macbain, Sterling Eneas Mackay, 1917, 256 ffThough this book is nearly a century old, the subject matter does not itself undergo changes like so many facets of our present-day world. There is more up-to-date research it is true, but a Celt steeped in these traditions himself, as is the author, is an excellent place to start any reading in the subject. Gaelic was the author's first language and he is regarded as one of the greatest Scottish Celtic scholars, specialising in philology. He qualified with a Master's Degree in philosophy and a Doctorate in Laws from Aberdeen University.After an introductory chapter by the Aberdeen and Oxford scholar Professor William J. Watson that puts Macbain into his academic background, the book begins with an exploration of the nature, cause and spread of myth. The author goes on to record and discuss what is known about the place of myth within the religions of the Aryan Nation, Celts, the Gauls and the Druids. This is an eminently readable little book and, as I too spoke only Welsh as a child before I went to an English-speaking school, and my father was a scholar of medieval Welsh poetry, the book was of a great personal interest. The author makes the stories come alive and the presentation is not at all dry and academic, though not lacking in academic rigour.Howard Jones is the author of The World as Spirit","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R212YICAAV2HN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596053399#wasThisHelpful","R212YICAAV2HN9","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dogs that know when their owners are coming home, and other unexplained powers of animals, by Rupert Sheldrake, Arrow, 2000, 320 ffThe title of this book may be rather unwieldy but it tells the reader exactly what to expect. Whether you are an `intelligent dog owner' or just an `open-minded scientist' this book is packed with observations and experiments (during which no creatures were harmed!) that confirm and put onto a rational statistical basis what every pet owner, animal trainer or animal homeopath already knows - that animals are capable of feelings and senses that cannot be explained or dismissed on the basis of human behaviour. It has already been found often that cats and dogs taken from one home to another, or abandoned in the wilderness, find their way back home. It has also long been part of popular folk-lore that animals, both terrestrial and aerial, can sense when there are about to be earthquakes, tsunami or forest fires. Sadly, despite being forewarned, they may not always be able to escape the danger.In this book, anecdotes (unpublished observations) of animal lovers are turned into statistically analysed case histories (accounts written down and interpreted by scientists, namely, Professor Sheldrake and his colleagues). As well as being fascinating reading, it provides a most valuable piece of scientific research.After a brief historical survey of the domestication of wild animals, Sheldrake deals first with human bonding with dogs and cats but moves swiftly on to parrots, chickens, geese - and an owl. The author has found no cases of bonding with reptiles or fish. But cases have been found of humans, using precognition or telepathy, anticipating the arrival of a friend or relative. This phenomenon has been studied in Norway by Professor Georg Hygen in Oslo who reported individuals sensing a `warning soul' or vardger relaying messages to them spiritually: as Sheldrake says `In non-Western civilizations, such as India, such forms of perceptiveness are still widely taken for granted'. Similar animal or human empathy over owners who are ill or who have died are also recorded here.As might be expected, Sheldrake attributes this animal-to-human bonding to communication through the morphic field and suggests that a similar mechanism is in operation for social animals and insects: the mechanism has even been endorsed by that arch-materialist Edward O. Wilson. Communication amongst social insects like ants has been intensively studied by William Morton Wheeler. Sheldrake also reports on the incredible experiments with chicks conducted by the French researcher René Peoc'h, where conditioned chicks were able to seemingly affect the random path of a robot. There is also a short section giving a preview of a later book, The Sense of Being Stared At. This is a wonderful book, concluded with Notes, References and an Index.

"This is an entertaining but fairly predictable western directed by Howard Hawkes. Gunslinger Cole Thornton (John Wayne) rides into town to meet with rancher Bart Jason (Edward Asner). On the way he meets up with an old friend of his, J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) who is now sheriff of El Dorado. Harrah tells Thornton that Jason is trying to drive another rancher, Kevin Macdonald (R.G. Armstrong), off his ranch so that he can get hold of more land. Thornton decides not to work for Jason but accidentally kills one of Macdonald's sons. In return, Macdonald's daughter, Josephine (Michele Carey), shoots Thornton and leaves him with a debilitating injury. Some months later, Thornton meets up with another man, Mississippi (James Caan), who is also intent up avenging the death of his friend. Jason has hired another gunslinger, Nelse McLeod (Christopher George), to fight his battles. There are various twists and turns in the story which goes pretty much to plan, but it's good entertainment if you like westerns.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21IDQY8TEJRS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFXUL2#wasThisHelpful","R21IDQY8TEJRS9","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie was based on the first of five novels (`the Ripliad'!) written about the (fortunately fictional) psychopath Tom Ripley by Patricia Highsmith. Like the movie of her first novel, Strangers on a Train, it probes the psychology of her characters. Ripley (Matt Damon) is a talented piano player who earns money as a con-man. He is asked by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to go to Italy to persuade his wastrel playboy son Dickie (Jude Law) to come home. Actually, Ripley soon finds he enjoys the life-style too much, especially the company of Dickie's girl-friend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), and joins in with Dickie's activities. The smooth flowing of his new persona is disrupted by his meeting with a real heiress at the airport, Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett), and a real friend of Dickie's from Princeton, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman). To Meredith, Ripley has already passed himself off as Dickie Greenleaf. Then a local girl that Dickie has made pregnant drowns herself. For the rest of the movie Damon has sometimes to be `Dickie Greenleaf' for Meredith and others, and at other times himself, Tom Ripley, for Marge and Dickie. Eventually Ripley and Dickie fall out and Dickie is killed: Ripley tells Marge that he has simply gone off to other parts of Italy, but Marge never really believes him. This is an intriguing characterful thriller and, though long, is really entertaining. The director was Anthony Minghella.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFRN6Q936U2YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0792165020#wasThisHelpful","RFRN6Q936U2YJ","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Greek Myths: Gods, monsters, heroes and the origins of storytelling, by Stephen P. Kershaw, Robinson, London, 2007, 544 ff.This is a collection of tales from ancient Greek mythology that many of us will have encountered, however fleetingly, in our school days and wished we had known the full story. The popular tales of Jason and the Argonauts with their search for the Golden Fleece, of Theseus and the Minotaur, and of the wooden horse and the fall of Troy are recounted here. Many of these were made into the basic stories of movies in the 20th century. Extracts from the classical works of Hesiod's `Works and Days', and the Iliad and Odyssey compiled by the poet Homer are given here in everyday language that allows them to be read like a contemporary set of short stories. The account here of the origins of Plato's story of the `lost continent of Atlantis' should put an end to the nonsense of New Age followers claiming to have had distant relatives from Atlantis - but then myths even more fantastic than this still endure. The author here completed his doctoral thesis under the direction of Richard Buxton, one of the world's great authorities on Greek mythology. This is a fascinating compendium with detailed additional Notes for each chapter, a few pages of further reading, and a good detailed Index. I would unhesitatingly recommend this as a source book for anyone interested in reading the symbolic stories of Greek mythology.The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208CMP3AARA8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786720697#wasThisHelpful","R208CMP3AARA8P","AFVROUVTT63XM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFVROUVTT63XM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm obsessed with this bag! The quality is very nice and durable. I love the mesh window. It's see through just enough to to where you can't see everything. I found that it really holds a great amount of toiletries and or makeup. Also has a little loop on the end to pick it up by. The zipper on it is also really nice and didn't get stuck or seem loose at all. I do highly recommend this to anyone even men.

"I really like this sports bra! I have been looking for one because i have started working out again and i need the support. It love that its a front zip closure so its every easy to get on and off. I don't like how the straps are not adjustable. I found that it has a slight stretch to it also.I am bigger chested, were talking 38D. I opted for the large as its the biggest they come. When i got it i was so excited to start using it however its so tight and somewhat of a struggle to get on. It is comfortable even though its a it snug.

My husband is also a mechanic and has to take off his ring while working on equipment and these are great and keep him safe while at work.These came packaged in a nice small box.

"I was part of a test group and was sent this in exchange for my honest review. It comes nicely package in a black box along with a pouch for discreet  storage or travel, a users manual and warranty information and even a battery to get you started. It takes only one AA and i really like that because who really has extra batteries laying around or wants to go out and but more right off the bat. I was blown away at how strong the vibes were on such a small package! Its very sleek and smooth. I feel its great for use alone or with your partner. It is pretty quiet also.

"I have never been interested in skin care but since I'm knocking on 30s door i thought i would give this a try when it was offered for review in exchange for my honest opinion. Upon the first use i noticed a reduction in puffiness and moisture in the dry skin under my eyes.I would sleep with them on and its totally fine. I didn't have a problem with them sliding around or off my face at night either. When removing them i was kind of nervous that it would hurt or pull my skin however they came off nicely. My under eyes looks ver hydrated, smooth and not puffy at all. I washed my face applied the eye cream and and went on with my day. The cream is rich and not greasy or sticky. After using this over 2 weeks i have noticed that i have no puffiness and flaky under eye skin anymore. Im not sure on how long the benefits last as its only been about 2 1/2 weeks now. The only downside to this product for me is the price. Im torn because as a mother of 3 kids and a household to maintain i can't see myself paying this price for something i can't reuse and have to throw away, however on the other hand for something that actually does work and i would consider it if the price was a bit cheaper because i would only need to use about 1-2x a week.Again i did receive this for review in exchange for my 100% honest thoughts and opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XYN4SQ9FB3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0TJ1SG#wasThisHelpful","R35XYN4SQ9FB3U","A2940DAGOU5LKP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2940DAGOU5LKP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter really loves these! They look very nice on and fit well. They fit is great, she wears a size 5 us and we got a small and they are perfect. They were a tab snug getting them on around the heels but they stretch just enough to fit nice on the ankles. They are not thick and heavy like other ones we have bought. These are very comfortable and easy to move in. We both can't get over how nice they look. They are high wasted but aren't constricting. She is very happy because this was just what she wanted for her halloween costume. They don't look cheap or bad quality. Also the insides on the leggings are really soft and lined.

"As a women we all have heard of Kegel Exercising. I never knew that they had weights to really help strengthen up. I was able to get these at a discount fore review purpose and i have been using them as directed for a bout a month now. So each color is a different level of weight. You want to start off with the lightest and work your way up. If its to light then go to the next you want to find your weight and then use the one that really uses your muscles to keep it in. I had started with the 3rd pink one and I'm now on the dark pink one. Im a stay at home mom so i honestly keep mine in for a couple hrs now. I have noticed a difference and so has mu husband.

The feeling is SO soft and smooth. Its also a touch flexible. Very easy to get the batteries in. It has a one touch bottom for easy off and on unlike others that have several buttons or a twist on.When we first tried it we were blown away, to our surprise if you press the on switch quickly you can adjust to 7 different speeds/pulses!!! To turn it back off its as simple as holding down the power button and it will shut off. I love that its 100% silicone and very easy to clean.

"Such a hight quality train case! I was over the moon when i saw this and then even more ecstatic when it arrived. It arrived very fast and also well packaged. Its equipped with two latches that lock and two sets of keys to keep your belongings secure. When you open it up, inside are TONS of compartments and storage. Was pleased to also see that it came with a caring strap that you can detach if you want to just use the handle to carry it. Their are a nice amount of extra dividers if you need or want a couple smaller or longer compartments! It makes me feel way more professional as an aspiring MUA to have something like this compare to what i was using.

Im of mixed race (American American and Caucasian) i have thicker curly hair and so does my oldest and it works amazing at not breaking our hair and getting the tangles out. On the other hand my youngest has very course, thick hair and it did work on her i just had to do small sections. She has SUCH a tender head and now only wants me to use this brush.

"OMGOSH, I'm obsessed with these! First off they so so so cute. They also common a very nice gift/storage bag that you could keep in your diaper bag for the used ones until they are able to be washed. The bag is made of a thicker material and also has a drawstring tie to close the bag. It comes with 4 very soft and high quality lined drool bibs. The lining isn't made of a water resistant backing however i feel it could hold quite a bit go slobber. The backing also is very soft almost like a cashmere feel to it and is very soft on the skin.

It comes with a nice insert of how and what product to use for each brush, however no way to use a makeup brush is the wrong way its all about what feels best to you. I found the correlating use for each brush is what i would use it. None of the barrels were loose or poorly made. Everything was uniform and made with really good quality. Im obsessing over how beautiful the mate black handles look with the rich gold barrels, so pretty. The handles are very smooth to the touch and also the brush hair is extremely soft. i do feel the foundation brush could be a bit denser so the foundation didn't get sucked up as fast but that is the only thing i would change however its not that big of an issue i was able to use just fine.

"what child doesn't love markers? I got theses for my kids to use at home, they are very vibrant. My son did color on the wall but i was able to wash it off very easy and it didnt stain the wall. Also a cap was left off of one and i put it under water and replaced the cap and its as good as new, keep in mind the cap was off for days or weeks so I'm not sure if it would work if you found a hapless marker weeks later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXCWQKT0A9XZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYDM84Q#wasThisHelpful","RXCWQKT0A9XZL","A2940DAGOU5LKP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2940DAGOU5LKP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why oh why didn’t I get this folding stool, years ago? I’ve only had it less than two hours and it’s already been put to good use. The top of my fridge is now dust free. I can use kitchen cabinets I couldn’t reach before.This Rubbermaid folding stool is the kind of product that once you have it you wonder how you did without it…or why… when it costs only $17.99.I think of all the times I struggled to reach something. This is going to make my life a bit easier.The stool folds and opens easily and doesn’t take up much room. It has 1” storage depth.  You can store it under a kitchen sink. There’s a non-slip thread where you stand. It is very light. You can carry it with one hand. It has a 1 year limited warranty.I am glad I have this.

"The Proactiv skin revitalizing pad is the most unique skin care product I have used.It comes in a box with three dark glass bottles (that contain retinol as an ingredient) and a jar with pads. There are an additional 60 other pads wrapped in plastic.You’re supposed to shake the bottle then pour the contents over the pads that are in the jar.You wipe your face with a saturated pad.It feels kind of mysterious and kind of fun.The directions say to use in the evening but I figured my skin didn’t know what time it was so I applied the lotion as soon as I got it. It had had a faint and pleasant scent. It did not burn or irritate my skin.I think Proactiv will last a long time. I see no reason not to reuse the pads though the product comes with plenty. The box states that the saturated pads should be used within 30 days from the date the pads were saturated. At $64.95 I can’t imagine tossing out any of the saturated pads that are left after 30 days.Does it work? I can honestly say that I am not sure. It didn’t seem to soothe away imperfections or give me a younger looking completion. Maybe my eyes are going. Maybe it’s because I didn’t follow up with the Proactiv + Three Step regimen. Perhaps I need to use it longer to see results.I will report back if I see definite results in a month.This is expensive at $64.95.

"Phyto 5 Phyto-Peel has natural AHA. It comes in a 2.5 tube. It has a pleasant, faintly medicinal scent. A little goes along way. I squeezed out a blob the size of a dime and messaged it in circular motion, according to directions. My face feels as clean and soft as a newborn’s behind.Phyto-Peel boasts of ‘gene expression,’  ‘pro collagen’ and of clearing pigmentation spots. I admit I do not know what this means.There’s an ingredients list that covers three fourths of the side of the box.Because I received the $73.00 Phyto-Peel in exchange for a review I felt it only fair to do some research on facial peels and scrubs which start in price from $3.00 so that I can help you decide which products to purchase. I was curious what makes a low cost vs. an expensive product. I never found out.At a cursory glance online, I did learn there are more than 19 facial scrubs and peels. I also learned that many of these products could help you survive if you’re ever stuck on an island or in a desert without food. Their ingredients are a veritable salad bar.Phyto-Peel contains mango and banana. Other facial scrubs contain: grapefruit, pineapple, walnuts, rice, grains, oatmeal, apricot, oat and almond flour, green tea, strawberry seeds, cranberry, papaya, raspberry enzymes, sea salt, citrus, tea, tree oil and honey almond.There's a brand of scrub called 'Triumph and Diaster Rock and Roll Suicide.'You can also find a recipe online to make your own scrub…for pennies.I wind up purchasing many of the products I have received for review from Amazon Vine.Not this one.

"I am grateful for the copy of this book I received in exchange for a review. I am also grateful I have glasses to read the book with; fingers that work to turn the pages and I am grateful that I am grateful for the second hand sofa I am sitting on and for the roof over my head.I’m making a disclaimer:  I am probably the worst kind of reader to review this book. As a psychotherapist for 30+ years I have learned that those with the least and those who carry the most pain and experience the greatest losses are also those who are most grateful.A parent with a dying child is grateful for another day; a homeless person is grateful for a roof over their head. Sitting in an oncologist’s waiting room you will find gratitude for a good test result; a good prognosis; alleviation of pain; gratitude for more time or for the simple and powerful gift of hope.Life is not fair, but sometimes life has a funny way of evening things out. What you’re not grateful for today you might not have tomorrow. So for starters; be grateful you could plunk down the $19.76 for a copy of this book instead of for medicine or for two weeks worth of food or for the cheap pair of shoes which is all you can afford.I think the author has good intentions.Studies have shown that attention to circumstances and things we should be grateful for improves mood and outlook. So this book is a good idea and will be helpful for some.For me, the book had as much substance and fluff as cotton candy. It was written towards a fourth grade reading level.I wonder how credible a woman is who appears to have everything to be grateful for, and who NEEDED to learn how to be grateful; can write a book on gratitude? She comes off to me as spoiled and self indulgent.I question the credibility of an author who cites numerous studies yet provides no references. She also cites the opinions of family therapists and other mental health providers; that without studies to back them up are only their personal opinions.This is a watered down version of many philosophies and studies.Consider that if you cannot feel gratitude you may be clinically depressed or physically ill or be in a situation that needs resolution and change.Meaning brings gratitude to our lives. Read ‘Man’s Search for Meaning” which suggests you not ask what the meaning of your life is but recognize what questions your life is asking of you.Victor Frankel writes. “In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning.I hope this book helps some readers to find ways to be grateful.I also hope that at least one person will be grateful that they saved $19.75.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2S2GVM9JTCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525955062#wasThisHelpful","R3L2S2GVM9JTCZ","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah Hepola had me at the first page. By the last page, I felt like we were friends.Blackout is a sharply written, brave and thoughtful account of author, Sarah Hepola’s journey through shame, self degradation and self destruction during dark and muddled years when she drank to the point of oblivion: blackouts.Blackouts occur when alcohol prevents the brain from recording new memories. Blackouts are not a loss of memory; blackouts occur when there is no memory recorded.  It is like the save button in your computer doesn’t save. There is a gap. There is nothing. This is the story of the life of an alcoholic woman. Hepola could not imagine a sober life.  She said she knew what she wanted. She didn’t want to face a day without alcohol and she wanted to not have to face the consequences of having it in her life.She tells about her first sip of stolen beer when she was seven; getting drunk in the sixth grade; her squirm and cringe-worthy (and familiar) adolescent awkwardness; her college years and her first success as a writer. She takes us from Dallas, Texas through college in Austin to New York City: drinking all the way.She gains success as a writer. She has friends: women friends; men friends; boyfriends and she has fun. Alcohol helps her through her shyness. It allows her to do and say outrageous things she’d never do if sober.  Hepola knows she needs alcohol to succeed and be someone other than the self that wasn’t good enough.  “Drinking saved me…it gave me escape…it gave me power…it gave me courage…it gave me the path…when I triumphed it celebrated with me…when I cried it comforted me…and in the end…it gave me oblivion.”Blackouts prevented Hepola from remembering the embarrassing and shameful behavior. that shamed her sober self. The blackouts weren’t intentional; they were the consequence of drinking to excess. Once Hepola started drinking, she could not stop.Reading her story feels like the nauseating realization seconds after you trip at the top of a staircase and know you’re going to be tumbling down, banging against the steps as you claw all the way to the bottom.And she does fall down; down flights of stairs, and she falls face first on floors, and off curbs. She wakes up with bruises. She loses time. She has sex with strangers. She writes about having sex with a man she’s never seen before and she describes it so vividly that her waking up on top of this stranger may make you squirm.Sarah Hepola dedicates this powerful story “For anyone who needs it.”The author shares her agonizing and fearful attempts at sobriety. She shares her fears; her insights; her struggles and her successes. Mainly, she shares her experiences and through them; she shares her heart and soul.You may see yourself in these pages. If you do, you’ll feel less alone and lost.Sarah Hepola is more than an author.She is a friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TYGRPJD6ZXE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554596#wasThisHelpful","R1TYGRPJD6ZXE2","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Itay Talgam is an Israeli conductor who has also become an advisor to business leaders; a ‘conductor of people;’ a TED lecturer, and now, an author.  He believes working for an organization is like working in an orchestra which requires individual excellence in a culture where people listen to each other. He encourages leaders not to impose their ideas on their followers but to encourage individual creativity and to allow for the possibility that others may have better ideas.Talgam expands his own ideas about conducting and conductors and advises leaders of the importance of allowing others to create meaning and to shine in open spaces and ‘gaps’ This book is not so much about ignorance as it is about open mindedness and the book could aptly be entitled “The Open Minded Leader.”Good leadership Talgam believes frees the power of the performers who are usually told what to do.Talgam describes the leadership styles of 7 great conductors’ and gives examples of each in separate chapters. He illustrates their individual styles from one conductor who is rigid and controlling; another who is detached, and the best one of all who is nurturing and encouraging.This is an idealistic work for a perfect world where leaders are willing to relinquish their egos and power and their drive to control others. Unfortunately, experience too often teaches that an environment where leaders do not suppress and oppress talented subordinates and where quotas do not take precedence over quality is very rare; especially in a shaky economy.Some leaders become leaders because they want to control and even oppress others.You can add depth and dimension to your appreciation and understanding of this book by downloading Itay Talgam's TED talk, online.English is a second language for Talgam and I found the writing to be vague at times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6RN3AHDBQLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847230#wasThisHelpful","R3F6RN3AHDBQLK","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh these wild berry and tropical flavor Skittles are so beautiful in colors of mauve, orange, green,  blue, yellow, and maroon that they’re almost too pretty to eat. But eat, I did!The colors are mixed so I couldn’t tell the difference between the wild berry and tropical flavors but it didn’t matter. Each color burst with wild fruity flavor all the way down to the chewy center.  These are better than many candies, like gum drops that only have a flavor shell. These stay packed with flavor to the final melt.They call them “flavor mash ups” but I found them to be happy and fun “flavor perk ups”. They’re delicious.They come in a 9 ounce resealable bag.Skittles are a great take-along-guilt free candy; 160 calories for six of them. You really don’t need more to satisfy a sweet tooth.

"Justin Gifford, PhD spent more than a decade researching Iceberg Slim (born Robert Lee Moppins Jr., AKA Robert Beck) accessing paperback pulp novels, prison records; FBI files, interviews, newspaper articles, unpublished fiction and letters.Gifford states that Robert Beck’s “Pimp: The Story of My Life” and Beck’s other works have transformed African American literature and culture, and have influenced…and maybe been the genesis of street literature, blaxploitation, hip hop and gansta rap. Gifford writes that “Pimp” became one of the most influential works of anti-establishment literature of the twentieth century.Beck’s account of black underworlds and of his years as a pimp sold millions of copies and he was once the most popular black author in America. By 1971 Beck had sold two million books.Gifford traces Beck’s beginnings, his influences, his adolescence (he was arrested 8 times between 14 and 17); his attendance at Tuskegee Institute; his imprisonments, his love/hate relationship with his mother and his obsession with being a “professional pimp.”This is also a sociological and historical study of effects of the Great Black Migration on America’s cities and the segregation, exploitation and disintegration of black communities.  Gifford captures the history of Chicago’s Southside; Milwaukee; Detroit’s Paradise Valley, and Black Bottom; Cleveland’s Central District and South Central L.A.: the jook joints, heroin and cocaine, playing dozens, the pimp book, the hustles and the cons.A central theme is Beck’s long suffering mother and Beck’s displaced hatred of her.This is a hard book to read because Beck could probably be diagnosed as having Narcissistic and Antisocial Personality Disorders.  He is cruel. He is violent. He spends a lifetime exploiting people and situations for his own personal gain.  His brutality and disrespect towards women …especially black women… is stomach turning. He blames his mother. He blames early childhood sexual abuse.This book is a walk on the wild side written by an author who knows and loves his subject to the point of adoration.Gifford blames much of the inner city crime on urban renewal, unemployment and the white establishment. He writes of the slums and poor living conditions but also about the harm urban renewal creates when the slums are cleared.  In Gifford’s view, the African American is blameless and Beck is a hero. That is my only criticism of this well researched and sharply written book.I have worked in Chicago and other cities with sex workers, heroin and crack addicts,alcoholics and assorted cons and gangsters and I felt I needed to shower after reading about the life of Iceberg Slim.Gritty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5COI7QPM69Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538340#wasThisHelpful","R2A5COI7QPM69Y","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author, Kyle Dickman was a former Hotshot who spent five years fighting wildfires in California. He has poured his heart and soul into this account of the June 2013, Yarnell Hill fire that burned 19 Hotshots to death. His reporting was nominated for a National Magazine Award.This book is so powerfully written I had to wait a day to process it before attempting to write a review. It’s the kind of story that creeps into your consciousness and pulls you into a world you never imagined. This is more than just a report of the tragic fire; Dickman presents a history and an education of, and about wild fires: and the culture and lifestyles of Hotshots. He profiles salt-of- the- earth men who exemplify character, integrity, guts, and grit, usually portrayed in movies by the likes of Clint Eastwood or Jeff Bridges.Hotshots are dedicated to the job and loyal to their co-workers whom they see as brothers.  They each have their own assignments that contribute to the whole. “There was elegance in the way the team moved.”Most Hotshots don’t consider their jobs high risk. “The flames were a sense of awe-not fear.”In fact, according to Dickman, the job is lower risk than logging, commercial fishing, roofing or driving a taxi. Fire fighting is a good way to make good pay in a short time.We learn of the hierarchy and the progressive steps of the job, from rookie scrapes to swampers to sawyers and beyond, to supervision.  We are introduced to positions like weather analyst, incident commanders and fire behavior analyst.  Being involved in fire fighting, and especially being a Hotshot is a source of pride. It gets into the blood and is easy to become addicted to. “At its best, the job is the greatest adventure of many Hotshots’ lives.”The training and preparation is brutal: six mile runs, hike three, do 60 pull-ups: 390 sit-ups and 240 push-ups.  Each man’s pack that he carries into a fire weighs forty-five pounds.That tragic day when 19 Hotshots are burned to death is described in detail so fine, we can almost smell the smoke and feel the Hotshot’s boots as they slip over rocks on their final and lethal route; from the first lightening strike and a fire, so small the incident commander determined a Hotshot team wasn’t needed, to the final moments when the Hotshots are trapped and surrounded by flames and they crawl into portable aluminum shelters.The author makes an argument for prevention, forest management and explains the serious consequences of early suppression of fires, saying that,” Naturally and regularly occurring fires played a crucial role… and removing flames changed the self regulating system.”Kyle Dickman documents the main sources used in each chapter.Maps will be provided for clarity. (This is a review of uncorrected proof and had no illustrations or maps.)This book is informative and exciting and absolutely heartbreaking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RORJRPZJC4VTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392123#wasThisHelpful","RORJRPZJC4VTP","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually purchase drug store brand batteries when they’re on sale. I do this often because I regularly forget to turn off my battery operated radio when I fall asleep during boring talk radio shows. I come back the next night to find the battery dead.This did not happen with Fusion by Rayovac which purports to last “35% longer than Energizer Max in digital cameras.” So I got a chance to test these batteries. It wasn’t a scientific test but I can verify that they do seem to last longer and with crisper sound than the ones I usually buy. This makes them a good deal. Cheap batteries don’t last.Fusion batteries have a 10 year guarantee to stay fresh in storage. (This means I can store them in my camera’s pouch or in a drawer without worry.)These batteries are mercury free.They are made in Fennimore Wisconsin and there’s a real telephone number you can call.Rayovac has a video about them on their colorful website.Rayovac also makes flashlights and flashlight bulbs. The company seems to have been around forever…which is how long I have been alive.The package says these advanced alkaline Fusion batteries are Rayovac’s longest lasting batteries.That’s good.

"The first thing you may notice about Josie Natori Body cream is the weight, 6.8 oz., and the large size of the jar. This will last a long time. The top of the jar has an interesting design: black and white squares with red flowers creeping up the side. The border of the lid is black and the jar is transparent, with the pale, powdery peach color of the cream, visible.Natori body cream is light. Its absorbency time is average. It leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.The scent lingers. For me, Natori has the unmistakable scent of menthol combined with other scents, perhaps a light baby powder, perhaps sandalwood, but for me, menthol was predominant.Others have characterized the scent as exotic and sultry.It reminded me of being a child with a cold when my mother rubbed a vapor rub on my chest.The ingredient list on the black and white box is extensive.UPDATE and ADVISEMENT: Scent was still strong after six hours with only a scant application. You may want to apply your usual scent more moderately as this body cream seems to act like a cream perfume. Some will love this, but some will not.I felt it was important to include this information in my review.Natori Body cream costs $58.00. Perhaps someone more sophisticated than me can tell me why.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFTEDIOW20RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6ZCD2C#wasThisHelpful","R2EFTEDIOW20RB","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excruciating, horror filled and nightmarish account of author Clark Elliott, Ph.D’s experiences of brain damage from a concussion he received in a car accident. He writes of his symptoms from the smallest detail to the global effects they have on his life and of his struggles and frustrations in his attempts to get help.Elliott writes, “The book is intended for those who have suffered from a brain injury and know it…for those who will not know it until they recognize aspects of their lives in these pages… for those who have family members or friends who have suffered a brain injury.”Clark Elliot describes debilitation so extreme and so pervasive that his efforts and ability to carry on with his life as a professor and father reach the level of heroic.He goes to a hospital two times. His experiences there are horrific. (One time he returns home with a needle lodged in his arm and does not know it. When he returns to the hospital, the nurses find it amusing.) He has appointments with two leading neurologists. He goes through tests at a nationally known rehabilitation center; He attends a balance clinic; a neurotherapy clinic; a homeopath, various physicians and a psychiatrist; treatments with an elecrostimulation therapist, an orthopedic physical therapist who specializes in brain injuries, standard and Atlas-specialty chiropractors, an herbalist and an acupuncturist and a sports medicine specialist.Elliot states that virtually every expert he has seen had shown little interest in his condition and even less understanding.He’s been treated with suspicion, as if he was a scam artist, a trouble maker or a malingerer.After eight years, he comes to the realization that if something doesn’t change he’ll have to resign from his job as a professor…lose his home…lose his ability to support his family...lose everybody’s medical insurance…Then, when he is at the end of his rope, he finds a cognitive restructuring specialist and an optometrist who emphasizes neuro-optometric rehabilitation. They work together to change his life.The author kept detailed notes from the day of the accident through his recovery. This book has pages and pages of his almost unbelievable symptoms and struggles. This is written from inside out by someone with TBI. He gives us a vision of a waking nightmare.This was a copy of an Advance Uncorrected Proof. There will be suggestions at the end of the published book for further reading.This important book may be a life saver for those with TBI and their loved ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83EJJMNJKXWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426566#wasThisHelpful","R83EJJMNJKXWH","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since being offered to try 100% organic Cocozia I learned about the benefits of coconut water.This coconut water comes in a heavy cardboard container and has a unique cap that locks into place to prevent spilling.That’s the good news.When the16.9 fl.oz.  container arrived I shook it up and took a gulp.Big mistake. It tasted bland and was reminiscent of stinky feet.I figured it was supposed to be drunk cold.I refrigerated it, shook it up and took a sip.It was still bland and now, reminiscent of COLD, stinky feet.I tried.

"This is a love story.This memoir is so personal and intimate that you can feel author, Jonathan Kozol’s angst and indecision;  see lines and shadows crisscross his father’s face; feel the light of his beloved smile, the twinkle in his eye, and you can almost touch his father’s strong but trembling hands. The Theft of Memory reads like a diary. We see Kozol’s father fade through the lens of Kozol’s eyes.We can feel the love. We can see the struggle to hold on. We can sense the loss. The book’s pages seem to have absorbed each worry and tear and every small and significant lucid moment in this recollection by a son of a father slowly consumed by Alzheimer’s disease.  The fading memory and physical deterioration of the author’s father are recounted in years and months and weeks and days and final minutes.  And when we read that Kozol’s hospitalized father is deteriorating quickly, it feels personal, almost like we’ve shared the journey with them and we know them.Kozol writes that he felt he was on a journey with his father beginning with his father’s diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease when his father was 88 years old. He recalls when his Harvard trained; neurologist father first tells him about ‘neurological spells’ and lays out his symptoms for his son in graphic terms.We watch the decline of a brilliant mind even as letters come asking for his opinion on academic papers or observations on a research study while Kozol tries to hold on to his father at home, then in a nursing home; then back in his father’s apartment and through the, hospitalizations even keeping a subscription to a newspaper his father can no longer read or understand.This is also story of a marriage—Kozol’s mother figures prominently throughout this account.Family secrets are revealed. Good and bad times are recalled.There’s also a discussion about the value of a life and how it seemed “A ninety-eight neurologist who suffers from dementia has no further value to the economic order.” There is an incident at a hospital of blatant disrespect as the author pleads for help because his father has a urinary infection and is sick, and the receptionist says, “How do you know? He can’t talk.”There’s another incident that will set your hair on end as Kozol’s father endures an extremely, dangerous and painful procedure that sends him into shock.Award winning author, Jonathan Kozol calls him Daddy.This account of the decline of a brilliant clinician to a baby-like state is heart wrenching and unforgettable. Keep tissues nearby.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OUFWK71WDQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140979#wasThisHelpful","R24OUFWK71WDQ5","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You don’t have to look further after you read all the reviews. These Clipperton shower rings are the top of the line. They’re easy to attach to the shower curtain and rod. They slide, effortlessly without tugging on the shower curtain. They are made of high grade stainless steel and they are built to last.Just read what the company says about their product and you can almost feel their pride.A True Story:I’ve moved a lot and putting up shower curtains has been one of the worst—most pain-in-the-neck things about all my moves. It is something I have dreaded.I always have to find the hole in the shower curtain and liner and then put the shower ring through them both—with one or the other hole slipping out of the ring. Then there’s forcing the rigid plastic rings around the pole. This is a major effort because my hands are not very strong.  Locking the rings was arduous and painful. The rings didn’t stay locked. In places, my shower curtain would sag.I finally gave up after trying different brands of shower curtain rings.Some were too rigid. Some cracked. Some didn’t stay locked.A constant hassle.Until these came, my shower curtains were held up by ribbons. Because frankly, I stopped giving a damn.This is the solution.Clipperton shower rings are easy to put on and lock in place. They are pretty. They are efficient. They are well made.Shower curtain rings are not a major purchase, but if Clipperton shower curtain rings can make life a little bit easier. .. that’s a lot.

"This is a hilarious and bitter-sweet account of growing up horny and Orthodox. Author Eytan Bayme, offers a brave and often pain filled peek into his prepubescent obsession with sex reminiscent of the style of a Jerry Seinfeld and Woody Allen.This book is a situation comedy. A better title; and less embarrassing one to read on the subway would be: A Boy and His Schmeckle: A Love Story; or for the more intellectually inclined, A Boy and His Genitalia: A Love Story. The fun begins with Eytan as a whinny, spoiled six year old brat who for pleasure, ‘presses’ himself on everything, everywhere including under a glass dining room table at this parents’ friends house where the diners have a “front row seat for the show.”His own painfully patient, understanding, lenient, intellectual and bewildered Jewish Orthodox parents call it “rocking.”They’re almost as funny as he is.Later we see Eytan’s machinations to get his hands on, and hide porn magazines.  He hides one behind the air conditioner outside his bedroom.  Of course it is found.  Of course this draws a crowd The discovery had me laughing out loud. Eytan hides other porn magazines behind his bed and under the bathroom sink. The maid finds his copy of “60 Plus” magazine about sex with older women and tells his mother who says he has to apologize to the maid. When he tells the maid he is sorry, she says she thought this was “A nice home and a nice family, until I met you.” He’s barely a preteen.Eytan’s friends are funny too. One friend, during prayer services asks God for certain baseball cards. Eytan also prays to God, “Please get me a girl.”Eytan is an outsider who is a slow learner in a slow-track class. He sees a psychiatrist, has weekly tutorial sessions with a child psychologist and sees a child psychiatrist every two months for medication. He feels like a loser.There' s a chocolate milk scene that will twist your heart even as you choke on your own laughter.In a heart wrenching part of the book Eytan, believing his highly influential father can pull strings, tells all his friends he’s been accepted at a prestigious Manhattan High School.Eytan’s sheltered innocence is charming and tender.Eytan takes us into his adolescence; his first cigarette, non-Kosher pizza, coffee, weed, Nine inch Nails concert, and his trying on new identities to look and act cool, (“Aside from my mom I didn’t know anyone who drank coffee and the cup that (his friend) held …made him look older than his years.”). We cringe while laughing at his adventures and small successes, big failures, embarrassing moments and girls. The more you read the funnier it gets.The ending will make you want to stand and cheer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCS08WLLV692B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067227#wasThisHelpful","RCS08WLLV692B","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What David Brooks heard on an old Command Performance variety Radio Show broadcast after V-J Day on August 15, 1945 set off a chain of thoughts. He writes that he noticed the tone of the era’s biggest celebrities was one of self effacement, humility and modesty. There was no self celebration. He contrasted the subdued and modest tone of this broadcast with watching on the same night, the self puffery and the victory dance of a defensive football player who had just made a tackle.Brooks discusses the shift from humility to narcissism.It occurred to David Brooks that the shift might symbolize a change in culture from one that says, “Nobody’s better than me but I’m no better than anyone else”, to a culture of self promotion that says, Recognize my accomplishments. I am special.”Brooks credits Rabbi Joseph Soliveitchik’s 1965 book, “Lonely Man of Faith” in which the rabbi notes there are two accounts of creation in Genesis that represent two opposing sides of our nature: Adam I and Adam II.  Author, Brooks expounds on this idea and he defines what he believes are the contemporary examples of these two opposing forces: Adam I:  The career oriented individual who wants to build, create and produce, have high status and win victories, and Adam II: The person who wants a serene character, a quiet sense of right and wrong; a desire to sacrifice and serve in the service of others and who renounces worldly success and status for the sake of a sacred purpose.“Adam I wants to conquer the world and Adam II wants to obey a calling to serve the world.”External vs. Internal. Success driven vs. Self sacrifice for one’s own inner moral imperative to serve.Brooks talks about Resume Virtues:  The skills we bring to the job markets that contribute to our success, and Ecology Virtues: The kinds of virtues that are at the core of our being and will get talked about at our funeral.Brooks profiles notable people in biographical essays whom he beliefs exemplify the Adam II Character with exhibiting humility and by challenging and overcoming their own moral weaknesses.  He cites a reoccurring pattern: “They (all) had to go down to go up. They had to descend into the valley if humility to climb to the heights of their character.”Davis Brooks admits to having a naturally shallow disposition, and who is paid to be a narcissistic blowhard and be more confident about his opinions, and be smarter than he says he really is. He has lived the life and achieved the external success of Adam I and now seeks to examine how others have trodden the road to Character.This book presents ideas we probably should stop in our mad dashes to think about. Brooks brings up questions and holds up a mirror to us. He clarifies and explains the humble hard worker shift to the narcissistic ‘BIG ME’ shift in our society. Much of the book is beautifully written. The Road to Character offers introspection and inspiration with a thread of religiosity.  This book, an ADVANCE UNCORRECTED PROOF is also uneven and verbose at times and often waivers from the pedantic to unfocused rambling.I question his character profile choices. Dwight Eisenhower, one of the people profiled achieves the highest job in the land (Adam I), cheats on his wife and coldly dumps his mistress.And of course the idea of the book itself exemplifies Adam I and contradicts Adam II.  Most people will read this book because of David Brooks’ success. How many of us would read this if it were written by a self effacing Shirley Sebranski or Thomas W. Jones? Would the book even be published?The Road to Character is well worth reading. The ideas in this book are going to be widely discussed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BKCKJHWHQRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R29BKCKJHWHQRM","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The chocolate colored contents of Jergens Natural Glow Instant Sun pumped out like whipped cream or a dessert mousse. It spread thinly and evenly and was absorbed instantly into my skin.The faint flagrance was pleasant and unobtrusive.I was a little disappointed that the warning said not to apply to face since that’s where I wanted the sun tan look most. So I tested this product by applying it to my lower arm. It dried in seconds and did not run off on my white knit sweater.Instant Sun worked beautifully to ‘naturally’ tan my skin. I have the 6 fl oz Deep Bronze color and liked the idea that it took 3 applications to turn my pale skin a light brown. This means to me that it is hard to make a mistake because the color gradually intensifies with layering.This does feel a bit tacky and sticky after it dries.

"I am impressed by many convenient and smart features of the stout and sturdy Travel Pro Crew 10, 22 inch expandable 7.7 lb. suitcase.The first thing I noticed, when removing it from the box was a grab indentation in the bottom  for gripping so it’s easy to pick up if you need to lift the suitcase or shove it in an overhead storage bin.  There are top and side handles.This suitcase has three main compartments: outside the main case there’s a zippered compartment for odds and ends. Behind this compartment is another zippered storage for a laptop. The main case unzips and has one plastic and one mesh pocket along the side and unique adjustable straps that slide up and down to hold clothing secure.Flip the side out and there’s an expandable suiter with a removable zippered extension panel and a padded roll bar to keep longer items wrinkle free.The ‘patented contour grip’ handle with cushioned touch points really is more comfortable than my other suitcases. I recall switching hands during long hauls across airports or hotels because my pulling hand got sore and tired. The handle also extends with a standard stop at 38” and extends to 42.5”without a wobble. I am 5’6” so it extends to below my rib case. This added extension is important for anyone who wants to be able to freely extend their arm while wheeling this suitcaseThe suitcase has a stability system that prevents tipping and spinner wheels that turn in all directions.Travel Pro is touted as the choice of flight crews and frequent travelers.You can find two helpful on line videos that explain all the benefits of Travel Pro Suitcases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKJ8KXXYLD8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS7U2EO#wasThisHelpful","R1CKJ8KXXYLD8C","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a kind of love story. This book is an act of love, redemption and resurrection by a daughter who finally and fully came to know her father when she was 75 years old.Mimi Baird was six years old in 1944 when her esteemed, highly educated, Harvard trained physician father disappeared. She was told by her mother that her father was `ill'.  When Baird asked questions, they went unanswered; she was told her father was `away'. There were fleeting comments about her father suffering from manic depression, but he was rarely mentioned and he was effectively erased from the author's life when Baird's mother divorced him and remarried within the year. Baird saw her father one more time, in 1959, shortly before he died in a low rent boarding house and drowned in his bathtub after a seizure, common in those who have had a frontal lobotomy. He was 55 years old.Years later, in 1991, during a casual conversation with a physician, Baird learned that the physician had known her father. When she mentioned this coincidence to another doctor, he did some research at Harvard Medical School Library and found a cache of her father's old letters.This was like the first tangible evidence that her father was really real. Baird visited the Harvard Library and found more correspondence. This emboldened her further. She called her estranged father's brother and learned her father had written a book that had been sitting in an old briefcase in her cousin's garage.This is the book from that manuscript her father began in 1944. It was published in 2013; twenty years after Baird inherited her father's papers.This book is Dr. Perry Baird's heart breaking story of his personal waking nightmare of the horrors of mania from the inside out, locked up in state institutions, tied up in strait jackets, packed in ice packs and subjected to nothing less than medieval torture: the only treatments doctors knew in those days before medication.Dr Baird's cogent controlled writing is supplemented by medical records which describe behavior such as: destroying several hospital beds, breaking panels from door to his room, breaking sashes from the window, threatening staff, smashing light fixtures, breaking a transom with his hand, smashing furniture and using pieces of it as weapons and `tearing the place to pieces,"" and having to be restrained....over and over again.Yet he was brilliant enough to be one of the first to be convinced that Bipolar Dosorder is caused by a chemical imbalance; he conducted research; got an article published entitled, ""Biochemical Component of the Manic-Depressive Psychosis"" in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease."" But it was too late for him.His illness caused his medical license to be removed. It cost him his family, his dignity, his friends and his life. He wanted the moon but would have gladly settled for sanity.This book could share a place on a bookshelf with Kay Redfield Jamison's, Touched by Fire, An Unquiet Mind and William Styron's, Darkness Visible.Shattering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDTLLPBLGWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137471#wasThisHelpful","RKDTLLPBLGWQ","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Empire of the Senses is a story of an assimilated German Jew who is married to a beautiful but frigid German woman. The novel spans the years of 1914-1953, and tells us about Lev, the main character who joins the German army in WWI to prove to his wife, her family and himself that he is not a coward. We learn about his experiences on the Russian front during the war and the characters he meets, including a woman he falls in love with and idolizes throughout the rest of the story.This novel flows along at a comfortable pace as the author describes Lev's desertion from the German army when Germany loses the war, and continues with Lev's daily mundane life with his wife and their two children in pre WWII Berlin.The wife is a self involved social climber who is concerned with appearances. The teen aged daughter is a typical superficial and frivolous teen and the gay son struggles with shame for his gayness and Jewishness. Lev, the main character is in love with a Jewish woman he met during the war.This is a story about the falling apart beneath the surface of what looks like a `typical family' and their comfortable lives in a Berlin in pre Nazi Germany. This is also a story about hiding who you are and what you love and the costs it involves when you lose your identity and your way. How Berlin is depicted in this book, while knowing what's coming adds a chill to the narrative.On the cusp of Nazism in the later part of the book things start falling apart. The tension as the book builds towards a climax to will have you breathing fast and quickly flipping through pages.And as you turn the last page, you may let out a sigh.I was perplexed by the title, ""Empire of the Senses."" Perhaps the author is saying that when we deny our sense of who we are, it consumes us and becomes our entire world.This 474 page book (advance Reader Copy) is well worth your time. The book is more comfortable than exciting which makes this story feel true to life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR1MF9R3TBKD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101870079#wasThisHelpful","RR1MF9R3TBKD4","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This autobiography feels like it comes from a desperate place.Kevin Sessums, whose methamphetamine addiction cost him a career that many writers would sell their souls for ends this autobiography living in a 120 square foot apartment with his two dogs, his clothing in garbage bags, no oven, sleeping on a worn out mattress on the floor, $1.23 in the bank and $5.00 in cash, HIV positive and clutching an eight month sobriety that seems so tenuous that I wonder if the next thing we hear of him will be his obituary. After a brief career as an actor, Sessums became a celebrity interviewer. He was executive editor working for Andy Warhol at Interview, and contributing editor at Allure and worked for Tina Brown at Vanity Fair; he had a New York Times Best Seller;  hung around with the New York cool people whose names(Madonna, Courtney Love, Keith Ledger) we all know, and all the while he felt detached,  ""...like, I'm just visiting my own life."" He writes that he always felt alone...different. He was gay, ""My wrists were wrong. This was not the way a boy should run...I could not mimic what I saw...I began to cry."" He felt like an outsider even in a loving home.He is seven when his father dies in a car crash and orphaned when his mother dies a year later.Throughout this book it appears that his grief, loneliness and his self pity cloud his vision and perception like a caul. Then he discovers methamphetamine.He was a super star with a six figures income; he lived in a 2000 square foot loft in New York's TriBeCa and he interviewed and socialized with celebrities until it all fell apart and he found himself jobless, homeless, and addicted and living on food stamps and methamphetamine.This is the story of Sessum's rise and fall and his spiritual quest to find answers and sobriety. He climbs to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. He shares his experience as he walks the Camino de Santiago. He tells us of marvelous occurrences in the real world and then describes, the universe-embracing, life- (death)affirming hallucinations he loves, cherishes and craves while on his methamphetamine binges, and he admits they surpasses everything... even his life...especially his life. ""I only know it was the most blissful, most peaceful, most astonishing experience I've ever had in this life because it wasn't of this life.""Sessums is honest and he is naked and courageous and he strips himself to the bone and soul and he adds graphic sex scenes and details about anonymous sex partners and it's like he's turning himself inside out.But he can be funny. There's a hilarious  part when Kevin is caught, by his parents literally in  the closet with his mother's dress falling on top of him and his feet in her high heels.We see family moments where there's tenderness and love. Shortly after His father dies we read of Kevin visiting his mother in the hospital and watching her in pain as she lay dying. We see Kevin, the little boy in his loneliness and his longing for his mother and father who loved him so.  We see him sitting alone in front of a flickering TV.The writing is a bit uneven; the beginning of the book seems to hum along with minor digressions and detours but the rest of the book feels like being thrown off a ledge.Kevin Sessum's  I Left it on the Mountain makes you want to root for Kevin.Desperately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2YBHSKO270R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312598386#wasThisHelpful","R3P2YBHSKO270R","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s nothing wrong with Beachblond Sea Eaves Sea Salt Spray by John Frieda if you don’t mind smelling like you got in a fight with an angry coconut… and lost.  This has a strong (chemical) coconut scent which may remind some of sun tan oil. It also does contain sea salt. So?I find scrunching my usual leave-in conditioner works better at making and keeping curls than this. I saw no evidence that this was superior at increasing a ‘ropey ripple effect.’ And for that ‘care free beachy style’ I just tumble out of bed and don’t comb my hair.This comes in a blue (reminiscent of water?) 5 fl.oz bottle with a pump that mists the contents.There are instructions on the bottle for long and shorter hair.All hair is different.

"Of course this smells so heavenly; there should be a label that warns against drinking it.  Shampooing with Sassoon Cherry Almond Shampoo is a totally sensual experience.This is a great way to start or end a busy day.The added benefit and the REAL reason we use shampoo is by what it does and doesn’t do.This does treat hair gently; even colored hair.  The bottle states it is also suitable for colored hair.This does lather up bubbily and creamily. (And yes I added an ‘I’ to make up those two words because nothing describes shampooing with Sassoon better.) This leaves hair shinny. This does not leave hair feeling stripped and dry.Simple.

"What's at fault for my being bored and not enjoying this book was my expectation of a book that presented `fast food' and easily digestible, dangerous and alarming flash points and not a leisurely five course meal.  I learned a lot about European history which is necessary to evaluate the present, but it comprised more of the book than I expected. For me, this was not light or exciting reading. Other readers will dive in and enjoy discussing this book and Friedman's point of view, for hoursIn the book's beginning, I found the author's own family history in Europe and their surviving Nazism and their escape from Hungary, fascinating. It was the most exciting part of the book.Author George Friedman states in the preface to Flash Points that ""the most important question in the world is whether or not conflict and war have actually been banished or whether this is merely an interlude, a seductive illusion."" He writes at the end of the book that the reason he wrote the book was to answer the question of whether or not Europe will return to its historical ways. To answer this question he raises two questions:  How did Europe achieve global domination, and what was the flaw between 1924 and 1945 that that caused it to throw away this domination. This is the focus of the book.He ominously writes that he thinks that Europe's history of conflict is far from over.This book is dense and detailed and focuses on history. The author painstakingly explains why the border between Germany and Russia is a flashpoint; why the Caucasus remains a flashpoint, and how and why Turkey is surrounded by flashpoints. The massive movement of the population from North Africa and Turkey into Europe is a flashpoint. There's a rise in Europe's right wing parties from Hungry to France.This treatment in this book may be too slow and too complicated be for a casual reader like me who is more interested in breaking news stories of Flash Points that have flashed and exploded like the recent events in Paris.This book is not for everyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V9O8JHB5I32I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553633X#wasThisHelpful","R3V9O8JHB5I32I","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought from the title, ""So You've Been Publicly Shamed"" that this book would be about readers' experiences with being shammed, the consequences of their being shamed and some advice or solutions from author. Instead, Jon Ronson writes that the book's journey began with his own identity being hijacked by a spambot and a group using his twitter name.This is a book about others being shamed. All were `outed' and shamed for different reasons, like the writer who made up quotes for a magazine article, or for the simple (only human type) stupidly like a thoughtless joke on twitter or a thoughtless picture on Facebook. I was disappointed. And also, around halfway through the book, I was bored. The book seemed directionless, and left me wondering what the point was.But I was amused at the beginning.  Some paragraphs were kind of funny. Ronson tells us all the places he went to interview people. He tells us how he found these people and how he got some of them to talk. Those he writes about include a disgraced former governor, a writer who lied about the research he supposedly conducted, and a man accused of engaging in a ""sick Nazi orgy.""He writes about attending a porn scene being filmed and participating in a group called ""Radical Honesty"" which helps clients eradicate feelings of being exposed or judged as not being good enough.I shamefully admit that I'd never heard of most of the people in Ronson's book. There were no Stars of Shame like Monica Lewinsky or the Clintons or Martha Stewart or James Frey or Jayson Blair (New York Times), or Janet Cooke (Washington Post).This is a fun book and a book about nasty people who destroy other people's livelihoods and lives, (some do it to themselves) and a book where we see people suffer and read of some of them committing suicide and a book about ""society's intensifying eagerness to publicly shame people..."" And it doesn't gel with the author's lighthearted humor and fun.This was a superficial treatment of a serious problem.Ronson ""gets it."" He ends the book with the line, ""We are defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people outside of it.""I wish he'd started the book with this line and written with more depth about consequences of being shamed, and not just for the characters he writes about, but for the rest of us. One careless twitter comment or Facebook faux pas and we're all at risk.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4B2CMMIEMJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487138#wasThisHelpful","R2R4B2CMMIEMJ8","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a compassionate book written from a personal perspective, and includes extensive research, interviews and historical data. The author explores the personal, psychological, social, cultural and political aspects of what we know as PTSD. David J. Morris is a former marine infantry officer and a journalist who was almost killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad. He writes about his own struggles with PTSD. He says he wrote this book for selfish reasons as an attempt to answer basic questions: Why does the world seem different since he got back from Iraq? Why does he feel out of place? What does one do with the knowledge gleaned from a near death experience?The Evil Hours: A Biography of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders really is a biography of PTSD that goes wide and deep into the history, symptoms, treatments, and the valiant fight by group of Viet Nam Vets to have PTSD included as a mental Illness Diagnosis in the DSM III. Morris writes of Shell Shock, Combat Neurosis, Traumatic Neurosis, Combat Fatigue, VietNam Syndrome all being different names for what we call PTSD today. He writes about the trauma of the soldiers in WWI and WWII and VietNam and the trauma of rape and natural and man-made traumas, as well as his own difficulties with PTSD. He includes interviews though out the book.Morris writes about his own treatments (he dropped out of one) and other treatments: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Cognitive Processing Therapy, Psychodynamic Therapy, Prolonged Exposure, Flooding, the drug propranolol and even Yoga. He cites the ineffectiveness and dangers and controversies of some of the therapies and the dropout rates of 54% of therapies with most empirical support. The chapters on therapies and psychologist and psychiatrist infighting is informative and is reason enough to recommend this book.Author David J. Morris writes that historian and philosopher, Will Durant ""calculated that there have been only twenty-nine years in all of human history when there wasn't a war going on somewhere in the world.""Morris writes in the final chapter about suffering and growth from suffering and he quotes psychologist Richard Tedescho who says his research has shown that post-traumatic growth is far more common than post- traumatic stress. Research continues.This beautifully written factual and philosophical book is rich on many levels. Morris delivers information about PTSD within a broad history of war and social, political and cultural movements and shows us the influences that shape who we are today and who we will be tomorrow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HFJRSLRWCPF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544086619#wasThisHelpful","R3HFJRSLRWCPF2","A2M34TR2T9YAXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M34TR2T9YAXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:24 MinsOh how I love wine, and wine loves me! So, when the opportunity arose for me to try this product, I was excited. I did order this product at a discount in exchange of my honest review.When the blizetec wine chiller arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see how small it was. I had no issues opening the package or did I need to grab scissors or an axe just to get into it, which is a nice change. Once I had it out of the package it was only two pieces that easily screwed together. The stainless steel rod and the pourer which has a built in aerator.Per the instructions I placed it in the freezer for about 2 hours. It was nice and frosted when I took it out. Then you have to make a little room in the bottle for the rod, insert and wait 5 minutes. I was really surprised that after only 5 minutes my bottle of wine was chilled to a perfect temperature!We have a great outdoor space that we love to eat dinner on. Unfortunately, I find myself running back and forth to the refrigerator to refill my glass of wine. Well, no more of that! This kept my wine nice and chilled throughout our 2+ hour dinner.Now what could be better than what I have stated above? I just about completed my Christmas shopping, this is the perfect gift for anyone that drinks wine!Also, this is very simple to clean with just a quick run under the faucet.I would most certainly recommend this product!

"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.I received a copy to facilitate my  review. The opinions expressed here are my own. This new author has a grasp on what it takes to be a great writer. Her characters are well drawn. Simon the main character is one you cheer on from the beginning. His best friend Derek is one I found myself going back and forth. between loving and hating. In my opinion, anytime a writer can make you love a character that you want to hate for their actions. they are successful.  The action scenes are just that, full of action. The reader goes from one conflict to the next. The tension is kept tight from beginning to end. I had to keep reading once I began it because I needed to know how Simon was going to handle situations. Would he be able to stay strong? Would he be able to keep friendships intact?  What happens when you have to make those tough life decisions?  I have to say I've known the author for several years. I knew this book was within her.  I knew she had talent.

"From the moment I began reading this book I had several thoughts go through my head. The first was howsorry I felt for James.  As a teacher I've actually heard parents tell their kids they hated them and wished they'd never been born. I've heard them blame the father's. This book immediately resonated with me as I am sure it will with so many of my students. The author has commented that his ideas came from several places, especially his favorite book, ""The Phantom Tollbooth"".  I can see how the worlds resemble each other.  I loved this world. It is a world I was very familiar with.  My students have a difficult time believing there was a time I didn't believe in myself. I considered myself no one special. I would try on occasion to better myself, only to have someone say something that made me feel like I was only average. James is whisked away to the land of Average where he is to be tested to see if he is to be their next king.  I thought it funny that he wanted to excel at being average because he thought that was the best he could hope for. His journey to find out what happened to the last king will change his life in ways he never saw coming.  I think this should be required reading in every class, in every school.  There are so many people out there like James who need the message in this book.  The funny thing is, at age 57, there were lessons I could still learn. Learning to step above seeing yourself as just average or not worth anything for some of us in some situations is an on-going process.  I will definitely recommend this book to my fellow teachers and readers, and parents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259224CMUNX77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016C3KPSK#wasThisHelpful","R259224CMUNX77","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.Like the author, I grew up reading mysteries. It has always been my favorite genre. When I was first approached about reading and reviewing this book I was surprise to learn I had so much in common with the author My husband has done some stained glass work  and he turns pens. We've both be involved in some of the same things. Then we learned she lives just north of us and her story takes place in St. Petersburg, FL, less than an hour north of us.  I loved the way she gives so much information about working with glass. Books like this often lead people to learn more about things like working with glass.  My favorite thing about the book is that Savannah must try to unravel the clues left by her father.  She has created characters that you come to care about including Suzy, the service dog.  It is brought to a satisfying conclusion and gets you ready for the sequel ""Shards of Murder"" which will be out sometime next year.  I have to say that I really enjoyed this and will recommend it to all those who love mysteries. This is an author you want to keep your eye on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOAUCDVNZXGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617737607#wasThisHelpful","R2XOAUCDVNZXGO","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to authors who write about nutrition, Shir Guez is my favorite. This is not your common picture book. This is a book for parents to read to their older children or for them to read on their own. I loved this book because it teaches about different fruits and their importace to our bodies. One of the reasons I love her books is I always learn something new. This book was no different. She spoke about the Lychee fruit.  I actually found some in an Amish market a couple of months back and loved them. Since I have put more fruit in my daily diet it is great to know how these fruits help my body.

"Ana Franco has created a story for all ages.  She has taken mythology and turned it on its head.For fans of the Percy Jackson series they will find a friend in this book.  You have two orphanages separated by gender.  When Kitty shows up at the girls orphanage and is accepted in, she learns a fantastic secret about the teens you will meet in this book.  Although they have everyday names like Andrew, Anna, Natalie and Thomas they are in reality gods and goddesses.  The author has combined several different myths to create this story. You have of course a couple of gods who are up to no good.  There were some liberties taken with the gods in her story.  I like that.  I hate having the same thing rehashed in different stories.  For those who are not familiar with the different myths some back story would have helped.  That would be my only suggestion.

"I was intrigued by the premise of this book and was thrilled once I started it.  As a teacher I see kids kids like Alex, Roy and their friends every year.  I have always fought for those students who have been told over and over that they are stupid or a loser.  That might be why I start each year off reading a book with the class called ""Loser"" by Jerry Spinelli.  These kids need to know that they are not losers.  Alex and his friends have problems yet there is a part of them that are coping with the bullying and name calling.  A part of them realize they are not losers.Alex is in  a wheelchair because he has spina bifida.  He also has the ability to ""spin"" people. This means he can take their pain and heal them. Having dreamed about his parent's death the day before it happened and being pushed from one foster home after another because of his ""strange ability"", he finds himself in the worst foster home yet.  His foster mother is cruel and abusive and knows about his ""gift"".  She want to make money off of him. When Alex dreams about his teacher's death and it comes true he finds he is in the crosshairs of some very evil people.  They will do whatever it takes to get to him.  Along the way he learns a truth about his family. I don't want to give it away because I never saw it coming and want you to be just as surprised. Alex learns exactly what it means to have true friends.I read this book the last day of school since we had nothing for the students to do in the morning. My afternoon was mine as I'd already cleaned up my room.  This was a perfect way to end my school year by relaxing with a great book.  I read this in electronic form.  I will definitely purchase a copy for my shelves.  I will mark it as more mature because of the language used.  I could see this as a movie in my head.  The author is great with his descriptions.

"I received a copy to review. The opinions expressed here are my own.If you have ever had a desire to be an Air Force Pilot, then this is the book for you. It is full of wonderful information as well as great pictures. The author makes it clear you must meet certain requirements to be accepted as a pilot. As a teacher I really liked the fact he made it clear how important getting an education is. I never knew how much was involved in becoming a pilot of any type. I also had no idea there were so many types of Air Force aircraft.  This is sad because my brother retired from the Air Force. He was one who loaded cargo planes.  There is information on the types of guns and missiles each carry, and how fast they can go. The book tells you what each type of aircraft is used for.  This is a book I would be proud to give to kids. If it ever comes out in physical format it will be a welcome addition to my nonfiction shelf in my classroom.

I'm ot into meditation, yet there is information about the connections between meditation and mandalas for those who are into meditation. Waht I found extremely interesting was a chart she had that is a color guide that goes into the meaning of colors.  I have always associated color with moods so this was just a great tool for me. The pictures go from the very simple that you could use crayons on, to the very complex that you will need colored pencils or very fine markers.  The thing that impressed me most about this coloring book was that it came in the form of an ebook. That means that I will be able to print pictures over and over and over, unlike physical coloring books that once you have colored all of the pages you are done.

"These two authors are firefighters in real life. They have written a story about a young boy and his mother who visit their uncle at the firestation where he works. His uncle lets him sit in the fire truck, turn on the lights and then has him help him with the hoses. He teaches him many things about the hoses and how difficult it is to learn to use it the first time. When he talked about hanging up the hoses to dry I asked my husband, a former firefighter about it. He said not all of them do. Some of them lay them out to dry. He said they need to wash the dirt and ash off and let them dry to make them last longer. I hope there are more stories about the life of a firefighter.

"I love this purse. This is the second one I have received from this company. The first was a canvas hobo bag. This one has an elegant look to it.  I was actually surprised by the amount of space inside. There were several pockets inside to carry all the things that I need.  There are two small pockets on one side of the inside of the purse. The other side of the inside has an open pocket and a zippered pocket.  The you have the entire opens space in the middle of the bag. There is a small zippered pocket on the back outside of the purse.  There was a very unique pocket on the front. If you look at the picture you will notice a real small zieer on each side of the front. The space actually goes from one zipper to the other inside. I decided I could carry pens or small items there and I would be able to unzip either pocket to to extricate what I needed. the metal detail on the front almost looks like rhinestones in it. There are none.  This is a very classy purse and one I am happy to carry. I have never had more than one purse at a time.  I find it amazing that through this company I have found two high quality purses that I really like, and that I get so many compliments on.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

"I received this product for review. The opinions expressed here are my own.I am not hte most tech savvy person so I really need to have explicit directions.  In this case I felt the directions could have been much better.  I actually needed the assistance of my son and son-in-law, who never even looked at the directions. Turning it on and navigating was not too difficult as there were pictures which helped this visual learner.  I was able to download music by dragging music from my computer to the folder that popped up when I used the cable that came with it to attach it to my computer.  It was no different than using my Kindle. The video was cute and funny. I still don't know how to add a video to it. I do know that the video was bright and vibrant. The sound quality was good, but that was using my own headphones. I have very tiny ears and had trouble getting the earphones that came with it to stay in. I next tried out the games.  There were 3 or 4 on there.  Don't know if you can add any more or not. Doesn't matter because I am just as bad with them on this device as I am on any other device. ""A Dog's Tale"" by Mark Twain was the book that was loaded.  Once again my complaint was that I didn't know how to download other books. I would not use that functio because the screen is so small that it caused the formatting to be off. With my vision issues the tiny screen made it difficult to read on this device. I will say that for the price they are charging and the size, shape and ease of carrying it and ability to download and listen to my music on the go that it is worth the price.  I would not give this to anyone that I know will not be gentle with it because I felt like it was a little bit flimsy. That may just be my impression, but it will work for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUHOOK526MPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWBH6N4#wasThisHelpful","RFUHOOK526MPX","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I prepare for next school year I've once again gone to these wonderful prompts by Bryan Cohen.  One of my favorites of this set is his ""Four Seasons of Creative Writing"".  Out of these five books, this is the one that is one of the best for teachers to use with their students. You may be wondering why.  He has it set up by seasons, which is a plus for me as a teacher.  I can find just right prompts for each of the seasons.  I love his 'Five Senses' and 'Mixed Bag'.  I can take the prompt the way it is or I can tweak it.  Often the students will take one of the prompts I've given and make their own tweak to it to make it their own.  In my opinion any writing prompt that pushes a student to make the prompt their own is top notch. Need a topic for your blog?  Bryan has a book for that as well. I've found these useful in my own writing as well as in my classroom. It is for this reason I highly recommend these to anyone who does any type of writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F2KEDNNEVDQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLUP72I#wasThisHelpful","R2F2KEDNNEVDQ2","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.Imagine growing up in a world where you can see God’s beauty all around you and follow your heart.  Now imagine that world is crushed by the death of a loved one.  Jessamine Brady lived in that world with her grandmother until the age of 10. When her grandmother died the Shaker community took her in.  This is where I really had to pay attention. I’d heard of the Shakers but really didn’t know anything about them.  I thought they were like the Amish.  Boy was I wrong.  I felt their beliefs were way out there, especially their belief about remaining celibate.  Men and women were equal in all ways.  They stayed separate.  They considered marriage  and procreation a sin.  I kept wondering how a people could get so messed up.  Jessamine remembers her life outside of the Shakers.  When she and her sister find a man in the woods and bring him back because he is injured, things change.  They are immediately drawn to each other. Tristan had lost his memory. When he gets it back he tells no one hoping to find out who tried to kill him.  However, the closer he and Jessamine get the more the Shakers are ready to send him packing.  That is exactly what happens and Jessamine goes with him. Tristin’s parents have made a marriage arrangement to save their finances.  Will Tristin and Jessamine stay together? If he leaves will she stay in this world or go back to the Shaker world?  If you want these answers you will definitely need to read the book for yourself.  It was definitely a different take on religion. The author did an excellent job of presenting the history of that time period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17R6Z0D0YO42L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A189BLA#wasThisHelpful","R17R6Z0D0YO42L","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The Opinions expressed here are my own.If you haven’t read the first two books in this series “The Thorn” and “The Judgment” I would suggest you do.Briefly you have Rose Kauffman who was taking care of her mother after a buggy accident.  You have her sister Hen and her five year old daughter Mattie Sue. Hen had married an Englisher and then gone back home during which time her husband began divorce proceeding that threatened her custody of her daughter. Then there was her husbands car accident.  Rosie and her boyfriend Silas have had an on again, off again relationship.  Then there is Nick, the bishops adopted son who came from the English world and seems to have left for it again after the bishop’s son Christian is killed in an accident. Does Rosie love Silas or does she love Nick? Does Silas love Rosie or does he love Rehbeka?  All of that drama and more happened in the first two books.In this third book in the series, Beverly Lewis has tied up all of the loose ends. Rosie’s mother is finally going to have the back surgery that will hopefully alleviate the terrible pain she has been in for years.  Rosie is still having relationship issues. She turns Silas loose, but now there is another guy in the picture named Isaac.  Then Nick returns. Because of all that went on with the Bishop’s sons, he has been “silenced”. I found it inspiring that it was the Bishop God used to reach Hen’s husband.  He had made it clear he wanted nothing to do with the Amish and their ways. After being temporarily blinded and having to stay in the Amish community, thing have changed.  So now you are wondering what exactly has changed yes?  Well this is where I tell you that once again Beverly Lewis has done an excellent job of storytelling and that you really must read the book to find out how all of these conflicts were fixed or not.  This is another highly recommended series by a great author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AEFDFMRYA1D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TQZ71Q#wasThisHelpful","R2AEFDFMRYA1D8","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.This is the second book in the “Season’s of Grace” series. Grace Byler is dealing with so much in her life.  Her mother mysteriously left and didn’t tell anyone why.  Something had been bothering her for quite some time.  Grace is trying to help her father and around the house.  Then there is Heather, a young English woman who finally confides in Grace.  He lost her adoptive mom to cancer and now she has cancer. Her father wants her to take chemo like her mother, but she prefers to try naturopathy. She learns she was adopted from an Amish family and would like to find more.Grace’s father is a quiet man and confused with his wife’s behavior. Their bishop is threatening to shun her if she doesn’t return soon.  One thing Grace’s father is pretty sure of is that his in-laws know something about why Lettie left, but won’t speak of it. Grace breaks up with Henry and finds she suddenly has the attention of another young man named Yonnie.  There is even a problem with this situation. Her best friends has eyes for Yonnie and is upset with Grace.In my opinion Grace was aptly named. She handles all of these situations with grace.  Nothing is resolved by the end of the book, yet you get a pretty good idea where this is heading and what some of the outcomes will be. Beverly Lewis has once again done an excellent job of creating a situation that will capture you and hold you until the end of the series.  I definitely recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R554ZMXNZIS5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764205722#wasThisHelpful","R554ZMXNZIS5L","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this sequel to 84 Ribbons.  After her injury Marta returns home.  At first she just hangs out around the house, most days in her robe.  She still has an issue with diet pills.  Steve has been a big support throughout this whole thing.  He is still supportive when she makes a mistake that could ruin their relationship.  Marta’s biggest issue is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life.  Before the accident she thought she had her whole life mapped out before her.  Now she is so confused.  What starts out as helping her mother at the dance studio, turns into so much more?  Will this be what it takes for her to straighten out her life?  When she meets the parent of one of her students she feels conflicted.  Will she still stay with Steve, or will her life take her down a different path?  At times I felt annoyed at her indecision.  I think I felt that way because I am a person who has a difficult time making decisions. Once I’ve made the decision the commitment is there 110%.  I know this is how Marta felt. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to those who love the world of dance or love to read about the world of dance.  This book didn’t focus on Marta’s dance so much as her dance with life changes. An excellent book.I received a copy to facilitate my review.

"Abigail loved helping deliver babies. Since she could only go so far in school she was an unlicensed midwife who worked with the local doctor. Unfortunately the one night the doctor is needed most, he is unable to help.  Abigail goes to help a young mother deliver her baby.  She tries to get the mother to go to the hospital, but she refuses. Abigail delivers the baby, but loses the mother.When the authorities find out that Abigail was not licensed, she is arrested for practicing medicine without a license and several other things. To add to her pain, her father, a bishop won’t come to the jail to see her, she can’t make bail because the community won’t help.  At this point I probably would have felt betrayed by everyone.  Abigail spends her time reading her Bible and praying.  At home her sister has come to stay in her house to help Abigail’s husband with the children and the household duties.  While helping out she meets a young man who works on the farm.  Everyone thinks Isaiah is mentally not all there. In reality he is deaf and very smart.  Catherine is aware of this and attracted to him.This is a great story.  There are themes of love, forgiveness and finding God in the midst of your trials.  Lessons of learning that God accepts us just the way we are where we are.  Mary Ellis is great at creating such realistic stories that tug at the heartstrings yet have so many hidden messages and lessons that we all need to hear.  You could never say her stories are preachy because they are definitely not.  This is one Amish fiction author you really need to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0OGPSTP7AX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PYDZE0#wasThisHelpful","R3E0OGPSTP7AX8","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.All is not harmonious in Harmony Main for the main characters in this story.  When Amy and Nora King lose their parents in a house fire, their younger siblings go to live with relatives and they go with Amy’s future husband to Harmony, Maine. John’s brother is the minister in Harmony.  He decides that Amy and John need to wait a while so that Amy can properly grieve her  parent’s death. Things are so different in Harmony.  They are a stricter community.  Amy is willing to try to fit in. Nora on the other hand has difficulty.  Their clothes are too bright so they must make new ones to fit in with the drab colors of their new community.  Where they would have had singings and buggy rides while courting, that is all banned in this community.  For Nora it mean no Rumspringa, which is also banned. I applaud Amy for trying so hard to fit in to her new community. I also applaud her trying to help Sally, the minister’s wife who doesn’t feel like she fits in with the other women.  Nora, I wanted to smack her for acting like a spoiled brat.  When John’s younger brother Elam, the rebellious one shows up, he takes Nora down that path as well.  Amy learns that she has an aunt who was shunned leaving nearby. She makes plans to meet with her and learns that is also forbidden.  Will she follow the rules or follow her heart? Will Nora ever settle down and stop causing so much trouble?  Will John and Amy finally get married? The answers to these questions are waiting for you  in the book.I have to say the only character I really had a hard time liking was John.  He came across as too strong and almost unforgiving in some of the things he did. However, like all of her other books, I really enjoyed this and would definitely recommend it to those who love reading Amish Fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCJG9FIF935I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008G5FLHS#wasThisHelpful","R1TCJG9FIF935I","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.Amish values is a book that should be read by any family that is looking to improve their family dynamics. The one thing I’ve always admired about the Amish is their sense of family and what is truly important.  One thing that really stood out is how much family means to them.  They love their children, but do not spoil them the way we who are not Amish do.  For this reason they don’t grow up feeling like we, the parents owe them everything they desire. They raise their family around their faith.  God is the center of the home. The author shows us through examples and stories of Amish families. This is not a book where the author spouts off, “do this or that  to get this or that”.I think one of the reasons I relish their lifestyle so much is because I pretty much grew up that way.  We are not and never were Amish. Yet, growing up on a farm with all of our duties were so similar to the Amish lifestyle.  I was never raised to expect anything except what God gave us. I worked hard as did all of my family.  It carried over to my own children, even though we left the farm behind many years ago.  My parents made sure that God was the center of our life. We started our morning with devotions and we ended our evening with devotions. I was well prepared for my day ahead.This book, with all of its examples and proverbs at the beginning of each chapter, shows that we can go back to a simpler life, yet not as structured as the Amish live, and still come out with some of the same great results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVJGLMA9B18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800719964#wasThisHelpful","RGVJGLMA9B18","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Take a trip through rural India. Learn about it culture and especially its classical music. Meet Kalu, a young boy who lives on the streets. To survive he runs errands.  It was hard to imagine that there could be anyone worse off than he was. Kalu has a friend named Bal.  I was sickened to learn his family sold him.  He had even less than Kalu had. Kalu had a talent that helped him improve his life.  He was gifted at playing the flute.  This ability  gets him noticed. It also is what helps him get an education.  As he travels we are shown the sights and sounds of life in rural India.  The descriptions are so vivid you get the image in your head and it stays with you. Just because he is discovered doesn’t mean trust comes easily to him.  Hope is something he tries to hang onto, but it is difficult when there has been so much pain in a small life. A great book from many aspects, learning about India and its classical music, learning about the lives of those who are on the lost rung of the caste system. I’ve heard stories from some of my Indian students, but this book brought it so much clearer.  A great book to read and learn from.  I recommend you read the book to see just how his life was changed and who it was that helped bring about that change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYKFAO0VH156N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451672047#wasThisHelpful","RYKFAO0VH156N","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy to facilitate my review. The opinions expressed here are my own.When I was asked to review this book I jumped on it.  I am always looking for adult coloring pages to help me relax.  I have a folder of individual coloring sheets I have found online to download. When I clicked on the link to look at this book I was surprised to see it was an ebook.  My first concern was how I was supposed to color the book.  The end of the book has a link to download the PDF version. I did that and immediately picked out four pictures to color.  These pictures are fun and whimsical as you can see from the cover above. I printed a whimsical cat, owl, a fun beachy type picture and a picture with mushrooms and leaves that reminded me of something from the 70s.  I enjoyed coloring the pictures.  The other thing I like about this book is that at times my granddaughter wants to color pictures like this. She's never been one to color Disney type pictures.  I know that this is something she would want to color as well.  I definitely will recommend this book. If I have a favorite picture all I have to do is print it over again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5SRN440GT6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112HM0XO#wasThisHelpful","R1H5SRN440GT6X","AX48LWJBU5RUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX48LWJBU5RUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are hands down the best 8 knives you will get for 25 bucks. I haven't seen any better for even remotely this price. For me, my mother needed some steak knives to replace some horribly old Chicago ones from about the 90s. I didn't want to spend too much and I didn't want to buy junk. I was about to get the Henckel ones for 20 for 4 and then I came across these.... they do the job very well.They have a nice weight to them and come out of the box with sharpness and decent design. No, you will not mistake these for steak knives that are 20 dollars a piece or more, but they are a good imitation. Full tang, decent rivets, and a solid, sharp blade. They look a little cheaply made.... but except for that there is nothing in this price range that competes. Do not dishwash.

"So far I have zero problems with this scale. It is very elegant and well made and I cannot find anything truly wrong with it. Weight could be a pound or so off from I guess what you might call a perfect scale but that doesn't bother me much. This is a consistent scale. I can get on and off the scale and it does not register different weights like the claims of some reviewers here. At least for me. The blue LED is perfect. The scale requires no tapping and is a no-nonsense type of scale with a beautiful glass finish. It's decently heavy but thin and has some padded feet for hard surfaces. You can switch pounds out for kilograms if you need. I can't give it less than 5 stars because so far it has done nothing wrong.

"Back in the heyday when Grisham was all the rage they were making some pretty good films from his populist novels. And here we get three of the better ones. It depends on how you look at it but A Time To Kill is probably the most powerful, though, The Client gives it a run for its money at times. Pelican Brief is also not a bad film just not quite on the same level. All three here have bluray transfers that are pretty decent for older catalogue titles.I cannot see anyone being truly disappointed with this budget release, though, some light DNR is evident most often in PB, probably the least important of the trio offered here. Softness is apparent at times from old masters and I take it lower bitrates. The Client has the only MPEG4 transfer with the others getting VC1 near the 20Mbps line....

"This is actually, probably, how a modern pop breakup album should sound. Local H keeps on trucking and to be honest their work is pretty solid. Certainly, this is probably not as good as a couple of the 90s albums but it's endearing in a way and never outstays its welcome. The songs are actually pretty catchy and this is basically what you get when a band that makes its best album in their earlier years stays relevant in the alternative genre or whatever the hell you want to label Local H. Unlike Weezer, as another reviewer pointed out, these guys actually still make decent music. I didn't find anything super great on here but most of it was above average and none of it stuck out as weak. It's good. poppy rock about heartbreak.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJWJXO5U22JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016CP3V2#wasThisHelpful","RQJWJXO5U22JT","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice collection of guitar pieces tied together by the excellent title track. Ackerman here creates an original mood that never wavers or recedes in the wake of too much complexity or too little movement. Seattle is positively stunning! An upbeat and ambitious track that perfectly recreates the busy rhythms of the city, picking up the record right as it starts to wane after the expressive mellow Sunday Rain. The title track is poignant and nostalgic in all the right places and a true gem. I don't really have anything negative to say about the album. It's a new favorite. I recommend anyone into guitar in general to check it out.

"My rig was 4 years old and had a decent paste before, I cannot remember what was used as I didn't apply it, but things were getting a little too hot for my comfort on load after 4 years. This one seems about on target so far. Looks to be about 1-4 degrees difference on idle and more on load.I tested Prime 95 a little bit--I don't really need these types of stress tests as I never see these loads in reality--and things were not heating up to 80 degrees at all, or at least not in the time I used the program. I would bet my OC is a tiny bit unstable in Prime, but even for gaming it is just about perfect and the temps were reduced, telling me I probably should have done the thermal paste a bit sooner.The paste was a nice consistency and spread fairly easily. I used the spreader included with the package and tried not to put too much on the CPU heatsink. I probably used about a larger pea size. It seemed fine and as a plus this product is not reactive anyway and will not ruin your motherboard if you get a little bit of overspread after screwing in your cooler. All in all a solid purchase. Curing is mostly done at this point and the rig is definitely running slightly cooler than it was before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYXMINEBDWL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002P5W4RU#wasThisHelpful","R1FYXMINEBDWL1","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Weber's accessories tend to be hit and miss. At first I thought this spatula was nice but in the end it's not the type to last. The steel is extremely soft and cheap; plated steel like most of Weber's Chinese made junk. It's nice and large but if you chip anything expect it to rust within a short period of time. As their normal grill plates are cheap steel so goes the accessories like this. Ordering a SS grill plate costed 70 bucks direct from Weber for me. Most of what they manufacture is simply sub-standard stuff meant for profit. This is no different. Rated 3 stars because it works decently. Otherwise try and find something that isn't so soft for outdoors use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20G06Q7LQFR6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009IH0EVQ#wasThisHelpful","R20G06Q7LQFR6W","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Die Hard 3 is still an amazing action film. The best or second best in the series depending on how you look at it. It's sad the series became a joke after this, catering to the new generation with terribly soapy scripts and weak acting. This one is actually for real. McTiernan was brought back on board after the little bit over the top nature of D2 and he brings a nice subtlety here that was missing in the second go around without dousing any major flames. Great acting all around with a good to great story that plays out pretty well in the end. Some elements are a little fantastic but it all comes down well in the end. I look at this as the last Die Hard. 4 was watered down entirely and 5 was embarrassing.The bluray transfer is pretty decent but probably could be better. It retains grain and has a pretty high bitrate, though likely comes from an older master. For the price you can't really go wrong.

"I like this floss the best. It gets everything out. After a night of drinking and whatever else--maybe you forgot to brush your teeth--you will definitely notice that this floss cleans well and thoroughly. It is not just a piece of flat tape. But it's not some rope like others are describing either. This works well for people that floss once a day or possibly once every other day or so.I wouldn't really recommend it for twice a day flossers as it is a deep cleaning floss that has some thickness. For me I love it. I floss once every other day and do a thorough cleaning as that is how I feel the best with my gums. The floss can break apart a little if you do not keep your metal slicer on the package clean of excess floss, but otherwise I have no problems with this stuff. It feels great on my teeth. If you are bleeding from a thicker floss you might want to try a little less thick version. If it's only a slight amount of blood that really isn't a huge deal compared to how deeply you will be cleaning your teeth with this product. A tape floss does nothing for my teeth and I still feel gunky after using those products.

"My teeth are doing wonderful with this stuff. I have been using this specially forumlated toothpaste with nanohydroxyapatite for three weeks, and I can tell it is definitely filling out my teeth, at least a little bit anyway. A very smooth feeling. Slightly uneven enamel has been getting more even over the period of time in use. There is a shade of whiteness after three weeks that was not there previously.Of course for some major rebuilding you would want to check back in three or four months. Obviously, this is not going to prevent cavities or make you healthy, nor will it make deep grooves magically disappear. What it seems to do is strenghten what you have and polish things to a shinier level. I think you can expect a shade of whiteness as well. You still need a diet with proper mineral balance in your body to accommodate remineralization.I am using this along with a couple other toothpastes; one including Uncle Harry's Cinnamon... the other a Jason tea tree oil product. I also do regular oil pullings with sesame or coconut oil every week. In combination I could not be happier with the results.I will update the review at a later time to see how things are progressing. What I wanted from this was a slight whitening and some leveling and polish applied to a few teeth that could use it. I don't expect miracles or anything, but so far I am VERY pleased. You get a lot of this stuff in the Premio version and it seems a decent deal to me. I brush for about 2.5 minutes with a medium brush using this paste. I think it is fluoride free as well for those that are wondering.I think you can trust the scientific results here that were published; see google and appropriate chemical terms. This stuff seems to have a good effect after three weeks. There is no doubt whatsoever that this stuff has strengthened the outside of my teeth a bit. I have been viewing them up close with a flashlight to see the various lines and irregular surfaces, and I am happy with the results.I must highlight that this is not for major problems that require surgery or medium to large resurfacing of any kind. See a dentist for those problems. All in all highly recommended here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R153C0XQQDFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016GCZSC#wasThisHelpful","R1R153C0XQQDFA","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the new version of the old and legendary Quest 4D boots. The major difference as many have noted is in the toe box. It's a bit roomier, which is nice. The toe room is ever so slightly improved. I went with my size 11 for the last boots and they do a times fit a little narrow near your big toe. The rest fit my feet perfectly. These boots are an ounce heavier, and remain the most stable boots for their weight class, rivaling other boots a pound heavier. They also remain supremely comfortable in most situations. The heel is ever so slighly more normalized and a bit straighter than the last version, though it was hard for me to tell much of a difference without full throttle hiking.

I have the normal Weber as I prefer the aesthetics of the wheels and the lid hook versus the metal lid rest that can scratch the top.

"This thing does the job. Most people buying this will want to know what is different from other years in the Weber lineup. Well, quite a bit and mostly for the better. The handles no longer have hinges that can rust. You can hang a few appliances on them. There is a decent thermo on the top of the grill and a heat shield on the handle. The ash catcher is very nice and a solid improvement from years past. The legs are not too wobbly anymore and I had no trouble with the height of this thing being a little over six feet myself. All in all this is a very solid upgrade if you are using an older Weber. The sides of the main grill grate also flip up for easy access to charcoal. You can fit comfortably about 3.5-4 racks of ribs on here. It's definitely enough for a 3-4 person family in most cases.I prefer this model based on a few pointed observations that I will get to in a little bit. But let's compare this to the other models directly: that would be the Master Touch, which is 50 dollars more expensive, and the 26 inch version of that grill without the Gourmet BBQ centerpiece or warmer. The 26 inch is 300 dollars. It will all come down to personal taste here between the grills. There are some things that you should pay attention to though, as it is not cut and dry which model you will want just from looks or lists.The 22 inch Master Touch and the 26 inch grill are a tiny bit taller, 39.5 vs 42 inches per the Weber site. I'm not sure what adds into the height to be honest or how they make it ever so slightly taller.  It could just be the wheels for all I know or possibly the legs are a touch longer. It doesn't make any difference in my experience. The MT has a center piece that is removable for ""gourmet BBQ"". A quick point here: I don't personally like this addition. I use a nice wooden grill scraper--chinese wire brushes are the bane of existence and a real danger at times--and the center piece would screw up the burn lines on my large and heavy duty scraper. The normal plates are already a tad off on the moveable sides. You can however purchase this version and then get a different grate if you want, but that is adding a decent cost to an already extra 50 dollars.**You must purchase a stainless steel grate for over 60 dollars with shipping from Weber directly over the phone. Part# 80728 @ 58.47 dollars--comes out to about 70 total. I advise most to actually do this. Another reason I prefer the cheaper model as I use the extra 50 for the better grate. The SS grate is heavier, larger guage steel, and in general does not rattle. I love it, though it was expensive. And it will also last a LOT longer than the mediocre plated steel grate at high heat.I'm not entirely sure what the point of the center piece is but to sell more Weber accessories. And these accessories are not super high quality either. Anything like a cast iron griddle or pan is easily placed on the 22 and 26 inch grill surface. I don't cook pizza on my grill and have no use for extra grill patterns or a wok. IDK your mileage may vary but it just seems to me they want to sell you more things. In my case it would burn awkward lines into my expensive wooden scraper. I don't want a lot of extras hanging around for the grill that need to be cleaned and preened. And without the attachments the center piece is useless. Add in the fact that all I want is a stainless steel grate and there is no point in getting this grill for this extra feature.They do however include two of the cheap charcoal holders on the MT. You can arrange your charcoal fine without these holders IMO, and when you actually need to move things around I find they become a bother more than anything else. If you want them they are an extra that costs 15 dollars otherwise.BOTH the 22's have plated nickel steel cooking grates as opposed to the stainless of the 26 inch. As noted Weber does provide the little known stainless upgrade for more cash. My grilling grate has a slight uneven rattle, though, I have not cooked on it yet. It seems fairly durable but I have to somewhat doubt its longevity. I will order the SS version soon. It is thicker and heavier.There is also the metal side holder for the lid that is engrained into the grill on the MT and 26 inch. From the pictures and videos it looks like it may actually touch the enamel lid of the grill. While pragmatic I am not sure if this will scratch the grill or not in normal practice. On the other hand the hook on this model will not be to everyone's preference, though, it lines up with the damper and is honestly pretty easy to hook onto the side with some practice. Minimal scraping of the edges of the basket will occur more than likely as opposed to the possible scraping of the top by the other method.I'm not too keen on extra holes in the heating basket from the lid holder on the upper models, but it's hard to say how well they will seal in the end. In practice I would prefer a lid holder with some rubber protection from scratching the top of the lid. I think this is something they will improve on future versions. Beware, the enamel WILL scratch easily on these models.The wheels are slightly different on the MT and 26 inch models, though I prefer the aesthetics of the originals by a decent margin. The gray hubcaps with a grill logo are kind of well not all that pleasing to my eyes and look no more useful. Neither seem much different in practice. The MT has black handles as opposed to grey. Both look nice. A secondary warming rack is also equipped on the MT. I personally have little need for something like this, but others may find it handy. The MT and 26 inch grills come with a heat grip on the top damper. This is really the only thing I wanted on the normal model. Why this could not be included on the normal 22 I have no idea, but it really isn't needed anyway. I'm usually only using the damper once or twice and have a grill glove on hand or a metal tool to slide it. It should be noted that the rib roaster fits fine in any model. I recommend the higher priced stainless steel version.The 26 inch grill is wider and heavier, for twice the price again. To me, as someone that does not cook for more than 4 people, I don't need something that large. It takes a bit more charcoal to heat up a larger grill to the proper temps and the legs seem to be the same thin design that have to accomodate more weight. For a larger family you will want this option as it is quite a bit more space. The only downside again is that it's very expensive. Per the Weber site they list stainless steel for the cooking grate vs plated steel on the cheaper model. 508 square inches of cooking area vs 363. The cooking grates are honestly the biggest deal to me about these grills. It is a nice feature of the 26 inch to include a stainless as they are expensive to buy separately.So I have spelled out the major differences here. For me it comes down to preference. I don't really care about cost, but 300 was a teensy bit more than I was willing to spend for something I am not totally sure of the long term quality. I like the MT but have absolutely no use for the center piece and the wheels and lid holder to me are very questionable. If the lid holder does not scratch I see no problem with it, but metal against metal is going to scratch a bit if it makes a lot of contact at high heat. Not a huge problem but the basket and top are easily the most expensive parts of the deal and I want to keep them looking nice. All in all the last Webers had more than a few problems that seem to have been corrected in the new models. Only time will tell.I did also get two damaged tops with this grill. I don't mark down the grill because customer service was fantastic at Amazon. Just beware you may have to take one back if you get a damaged top. Weber should invest in some better packaging. Otherwise. this thing is a beauty. Highly recommended.I do not however recommend the cheap and terrible cover for the 22 inch grills. It has a hanging bag sewn to it and only one main velcro strap. It looks cheap. It is cheap. Yet it's 30 dollars. I bet it's made in China for about a dollar. Just a warning. You might want to look elsewhere to see if you can find a better cover. I will wait until they improve it before I buy anything of such low quality.I will also update this review as I keep using the grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PAV50DVG03UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKB5TXA#wasThisHelpful","R3PAV50DVG03UB","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely adore the solo guitar work on Casbah, Smokey River, Finches, and the other selections, but some of the lyrical content sounds just a little too traditional for my tastes compared to some of his other selections. I think he branched out on the second album in a very good way and continued to do so throughout the 70s. You can't go wrong here at any rate; it's definitely an album that turned a lot of people on to this style of folk. A very solid and great album.It contains more solos without singing than the second album as well. But to me it is also a little less cohesive and has worse production--Do You Hear Me Now seems a touch out of place on this record, and a couple of the songs are a little monotonous. At 15 tracks it does very well with its time on the whole. I do think that people will really love the various guitar solos sprinkled throughout, and that alone is worth the purchase as there are quite a few of them.

"A great sequel to the first album and quite honestly, overall, an album that hits a slightly higher peak in the lyrical selections for me. I actually prefer my favorite tracks from this one. Top stuff in the blues/folk genre. He even seems to gives each song a flavor that seems to add up to just a bit more than the debut IMO, which was more or less a great album that introduced you to his style but had a few more songs that started to grate at times. I can't say I like every song here but the best ones are truly great. The Eastern influences are very much appreciated and give the album a fresh outlook.Songs like My Lover, It Don't Bother Me, Anti Apartheid, and 900 Miles are absolutely fantastic lyrical productions while The Wheel and Lucky Thirteen are beautiful guitar pieces. You can't really go wrong with this one or the debut, but I feel this one is slightly more cohesive and distinct with its lyrical selections.

"Cheaply made and largely a pile of crap. Not sure where all these reviews are coming from. I can tell you right now this is made for about 50 cents in China, if that much. Thin. One velcro strap, with another tiny one at mid level on the other side--idiotic beyond belief--and a terrible bag that just hangs from the bottom for storage. Why attach the bag to the grill cover? When the grill cover is covering the grill where do you put the stupid bag that hangs over a foot from the bottom. Who designs this kind of stuff? The tiny velcro patch on the inside isn't enough to hold the storage bag or much else. What are you supposed to use this tiny thing for lol? It's like 3 inches long. The other velcro strap is fine. But that's only one decent strap!This is the bare minimum that SHOULD have come with the grill. I don't plan to have my grill out in the elements much and with this cover I wouldn't trust it in MN winters anyway. I heard they improved this cover and honestly it's pretty hard to believe. It doesn't look like this thing would make two years in the sun.I'd be OKAY with the cover, for the record, if they had simply had some quality stitching and had the storage bag separate or with a pouch of its own inside the grill cover itself instead of just randomly hanging from the cover. Charging 30 dollars for a thin cover like this I at least expect some conceptual design that isn't ridiculously out of date.That would consist of two decent velcro straps at the bottom and an inside storage bag, or another longer strap for the bag to be tied, for the storage bag itself. There are not many options for people here so I guess this is what you have to get. It's pretty obvious their profit margin on this thing is pretty huge.

"These are the fabled yeast vitamins. They do seem pretty high-quality and have some good additions like vitamin C from orange and A from carrot, but most of them are from the S. cerevisiae process of converting whatever they use with yeast to a more bioavailable product.

Even with 15% with S&S I am paying 40 bucks.I tend to switch multis every 5 months or so and these are in rotation at times. For 90 tablets they are actually about as expensive as some other brands like Garden of Life, which holds only 60. It's up to you to do your research on what you prefer. The GoL product does actually seem to be produced from more food sources. As to how bioavailable or better for you all this is.... well again you will have to come to your own conclusions.FWIW this company is generally of high-quality throughout their product line. These ARE better than normal vitamins and are more bioavailable. But it's hard to say how much without any concrete science.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQOUYCLBPKVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H26TVK0#wasThisHelpful","R3EQOUYCLBPKVC","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll never buy a metal brush again as I have almost swallowed two bristles in the past couple years. Those things can do mega damage to you as a quick search on google might tell you. Though, expensive, this is the ONLY thing I will use to clean my grill ever again. I cannot believe the number of people that use metal brushed. While they may not fail, the problems occure if you use any kind of oil or other like substances that can make grates sticky. When you clean any amount of these bristles can come off. The cheaper brushes with shorter strands are to be avoided at all costs.This here tool is flawless mostly. Just make sure you burn it in right for your grill and you will have no problems whatsoever. Nice oak hardwood and finish. Work as they advertised. Also will not harm any kind of metal finish on grill plates if that is a fear. Never go back.I recommend a full plot of charcoal and high heat to burn it in. Doesn't take more than a couple of times. It does not totally clean the grates, obviously, because it's just a wood finish scraping the top. But it does the job just fine for me.

"Still going strong after about 8 years. I bought one of the originals and it doesn't look to have changed all that much. It still works very well. I use it mostly just for the pulley system and back in the day it was this or a couple others like the Chuck Norris machine lol. This one won out despite being a little spendy and it has totally held up and improved my health. Nothing bad to say about it.Using weights seems to work well too if you need that. I just put it on the highest height and use it for medium exercise along with dumbbells. I couldn't really ask for more. There are a bunch of extra add-ons for pullups, foot ties, and various other things that will be of use to many. The company seems pretty good about warranty and other things like that. There really are not that many choices when it comes to these types of machines and the Total Gyms looked a lot cheaper by comparison. Supports my 200 pound weight with ease.

"A new take on the formula that just works. Period. I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from but it possibly has to do with Uplay. I have a very nice PC and tbh I don't have many problems at all with Uplay. You can basically disable the thing and play offline just fine. Graphics drivers, at least for Nvidia, have come a long way here and I get 60FPS pretty solid with all but Nvidia shadows on. The rest is Ultra plus HBAO. I get a few hangs now and then from Uplay but even that service has drastically improved for me. Watch your overclocks for a game like this.Getting to the game: let's get the only negatives out of the way. You have done this before in many ways. And the LOD pop-ins when flying over the island are still a little bit last gen as is the anisotropic, or lack thereof, filtering on the ground. Other than that this is easily the most polished iteration of the series and the best one by a fair margin. The story is fun if not always great, the missions are much more polished and interesting, and the overall aesthetic is just wonderful. It's like playing Uncharted 2 in an open world. And there is a lot to collect and do in this version. More so than Far Cry 3.Your preference of which game's locale is better comes down to taste, but I find myself more and more preferring the realistic and very well done natural habitat of the Tibet region. On PC this one looks more polished than 3 by a decent margin. The vehicles are as good or better. The weapons are about the same. But I think the NPCs and all around direction of this one remains more confident. The story is less annoying and more fun, the enemies have better AI and the missions on hard are definitely at the right difficulty for a game like this.If you can afford to run this with all settings on max you are in for a treat. The only aforementioned problems in graphics are due to this series still being stuck on the old gens systems. I think that will change with the next iteration. But for what they could do here they did a damn fine job. I haven't even touched multiplayer and don't really plan to. There is so much to do in the main game that it's basically all I really care about. I think the balance is pretty good in this one too. You don't feel too overpowered on hard. The guns come at a decent clip as you complete the lower and upper parts of the island. The places you visit are distinct and very detailed.That isn't to say this is a brand new take on the series. It's a more polished version of Far Cry 3 in Tibet, with all the mountains and vistas and secrets you could imagine. No, it's nothing new, but it's all true fans could ask for in such a short period of time. I really look forward to where they take this series next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPM7GZVH2ZD79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAED6Y8#wasThisHelpful","RPM7GZVH2ZD79","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did they ever step up their game with this album. The voice. The guitar the bass the drums. EVERYTHING! I'm not sure there has been too many albums where a band has suddenly transformed itself into a juggernaut like this. Sure, old fans including me loved these guys before but this is when they HIT their peak and went on strolling. You cannot miss this album. A staple of alternative-grunge rock or whatever you want to call it. DOES NOT MATTER. Goes way past that man. Soundgarden rewrote the book on what you could do with a unique singer on this album. The riffs and the lyrics along with the voice are just innovative in their pure, driven necessity.

"Point Break is a very good film overall from the 80s/90s heyday of action-dramas. Kathryn Bigelow's first box office smash, starring Reeves and Swayze in roles that fit them well, deserves a look from people that haven't seen it before. It doesn't have much wrong with it from a critical perspective IMO, and most scenes still work well today.The Bluray is good quality with a nice bitrate and a transfer that at times can be soft but is mostly pretty decent for a minor catalogue title. I was happy with how transfer came out. For 5 bucks the action and surfing sequences are usually very well done and the story is fairly creative for its day.

"Another of the famed Sapphire series of blurays that went to the cellar for whatever they did here and came up with garbage. An old master, a sharpened and harsh image, yadda yadda. If it's your favorite film it may be worth 5 bucks, but I'll hold out for something better.

"One of the best western games ever made really. The COJ franchise took a wrong turn there with Cartel and even before that their engine just wasn't very good to be quite honest, and it made their games, which are somewhat linear, kind of a drag.Well, all that is fixed and more. This is one of the best Western genre games ever made. Informative, with the many nuggets you can find while playing, which lead to material to read about the West, to highly entertaining with the very talkative narrator who will trick you quite a lot throughout. The graphics to me are actually pretty amazing. Get the HBAO+ code working on an Nvidia card and play this in 1800p or higher for the best time. I use a 970 overclocked and I'm doing fantastic on maxed settings and 1800p.The environments have been improved a ton since the old days of the first couple games. No longer do things pop in and out everywhere. The textures are decent, the sounds and the guns are interesting, and the upgrade system is pretty fun on the harder difficulties. I recommend starting off on hard. I'm playing with a DS4 and each and every environment evokes the West perfectly. You can get rid of the vignette with a simple tweak on PC as that is annoying. Otherwise now complaints the shooting is fun and fair and the old time vibe is just killer!I cannot recommend this game enough if you have a nice PC. Go for it. You are missing out on a really swell take on the genre. No, it doesn't really do anything new but it has a lot of style and the gunfights are fun. That along with some very decent graphics and stylized art makes it a no-brainer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXM4Q61DS1CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMSCWEU#wasThisHelpful","R3TXM4Q61DS1CT","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good news is that the main album sounds as good or better than it did before. It will be near indistinguishable for those who are not careful listeners, and even I had trouble hearing much difference. A little more clarity, however small, matched with some more neutral and toned bass it seems. But no one is going to care much. You came here for the outtakes and extras.Pretty strange no one here mentioned how loud Howie Weinberg made ALL the demo discs and outtakes. Each and every one of them is mastered to a ridiculously high level. DR4-6 all around on these discs. The third disc survives at DR6. It's a little tough to care about demo and outtakes to be honest in some kind of definitive way, but that doesn't mean you need to push this stuff. Adjusted for volume they don't sound horrible always just very LOUD.A lot of us were really looking forward to the set, and for whatever reason Billy has chosen to go back to this guy again and again. It must be said that it is nice and punchy, but when a full band gets going or complexity overwhelms a naturally loud track these mastering techniques start to fall apart. Howie mastered their newest studio album in the DR5-7 range mostly. I would have preferred that here and more range.One listen of To Sheila on the Mono disc tells you all you need to know about these mastering techniques. Even though Howie backs off it is still way too loud for material like that. Plus Mono being that loud really doesn't make a lot of sense to me. He really butchered the Mono disc IMO. Honestly, it sounds like a badly recorded SP live album lol. The stereo version kills this version PERIOD.Corgan had Ludwig doing ALL the mastering work for the remasters up until the Pisces Iscariot Disc 2 in the deluxe version, which was crushed by Howie accordingly. Luckily, Ludwig did ALL their MAIN albums and their outtakes besides the outtakes from Adore and Pisces. Now don't get me wrong Howie did the original SP albums in the 90s, but around 1999 or so he just started maxing out all his discs for whatever reason. I'm not sure if this comes down to bass or what it is that makes these guys use the brickwall techniques. Bass is very good on these discs but a DR7-13 mastering would have preserved the dynamics and soft to loud transitions MUCH better. Howie USED to do DR7-DR13 or so up until his turning point in the late 90s. Now almost everything he touches is DR4-DR7 and way too loud and overblown.It must be asked if you wanted Howie's style at all why choose Ludwig for all the main albums and most of the earlier outtakes? It's obvious Ludwig is keeping the dynamics intact where as Howie is going for some kind of modern, compressed, and very bassy presentation. The crazy thing is most of this Pumpkins stuff doesn't seem to need anything in that range. DR7 at most to my ears. And even away from the numbers you can hear just how loud and uniform everything sounds. I would have died if Billy let Howie do the main albums!I have to tick my stereo back 3-6dB to volume match properly. I'd like a good article on why people go to the levels that Howie goes to on almost all his albums now. I don;t see any reason to do it when most of have very nice stereos. We have VOLUME KNOBS. Keep the dynamics! At least some of them.I honestly would not pay for this as is. I don't even really like the new artwork either. In fact, I don't like much of any of the new artwork on these remasters. This one is the worst of them all though. Just not digging all the red with the chick on this one. Looked much better in its original style. And the price is again pretty steep. I have no intention to support a millionaire many times over with hundreds of dollars. You all know where you can go for this.I'd say Disc 3 is pretty good. From there it gets fairly iffy. There are no whole concerts on the main discs. Nothing in the outtakes but the acoustic stuff is really my kind of thing. A lot of the songs on Discs 4 and 5 aren't really the best of material to be frank, and a lot of it is taken from Machina II sessions. The Sadlands demos are pretty good. But mixed in with all this other stuff I'm not really sure what the point is.... some of it is obvious filler. The usual stuff that is thrown away or kept safe somewhere for archival reasons. So if you are a collector by all means get this. But the single album remaster will work for most people and the original album also sounds just as good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYFM4SO1YX42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXLQNP6#wasThisHelpful","R1DYFM4SO1YX42","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A fantastic noir with simple values. With most action films being so randomly mindane and terribly shot this film is a nice respite to the junk hollywood usually peddles out. It's funny reading some of the negative reviews on this film for sure. I'm not sure what people expected here. The dialogue is laser tight for the most part, the characters are interesting, and the circumstances are fully engaging. I appreciate all the work that went into setting up the backstory and environment here, which is very subtle but well-planned and intriguing.This isn't a period drama folks. Nor is it Blade Runner. As long as you have a brain going into this you can sort out the rest and realize what the intentions of the film are rather than hope it to be something it never set out to do. Great choregraphy and acting all around for what amounts to a very terse picture based on simple values with a load of pretty violence to follow in wake of its vengeance. Give it a try.

"This is another decent Fincher flick that rises above on its great direction and soundtrack along with great acting by all involved. The problem again is a script that doesn't seem to tidy itself very well toward the end. Same with his Tattoo film, which gave no context for the ending, as we assume he will never make another of them, and kind of robbed the viewer of the relationships it portrayed. But this one held so much promise that it inadvertantly started making me a little angry when the last 30m just falls apart and starts to reveal the flaws of the source material.I didn't like how Tattoo ended because it was obviously not complete, and this one is similar in that no ends are tied up, but then again not tying them up leaves no one satisfied either. Some of the ending scenes are completely amateurish and not in the least believable, where most of the picture is believable and strives to be this way. I get that it says something about marriage and love, but it doesn't quite follow through with its message imo. Fincher's films are increasingly becoming without substance near the end, and completely overcome by the textural sounds.Where Seven and Fight Club had something to say against their pop veneer all the way through, this one seems to start wearing out its welcome by the end. I loved this film before I suspect it followed the book into a hole of its own making. The last 30m were a whirlwind of awful and great. Some of the scenes are so over the top as to be completely ridiculous, but in the end it is good, just WAY too slick for my tastes.I'm just going to stay thankful that this replaced the absolutely awful Button film as his highest grossing picture. I couldn't make it 30m through that pile of crap. This was at least fairly entertaning until the off the scope endgame that seemed like it was written by some high school kid wanting to bleed out the novel. More subtly please.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUT4DUGGWCVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5996EQ#wasThisHelpful","RMUT4DUGGWCVW","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A product that uses bleach needs to be studied for any kind of chemical reactions with any of your other products and organisms.Whereas Stability has a known, versatile, and needed chemical concoction--as does Prime--the other products they are selling are usually for the more complex setups.For this product it will work better for you if a dirty tank is your problem, most likely stemming from wood or plants or many fish that you cannot seem to keep stable.

"What more can be said? It improved on the first game in every way. Revisiting these classic games through ePSXe has been a joy. Apply a great filter like xBRZ or xBR and just marvel at how these still hold up today. This one even has a fan patch you should check out as it fixes a couple bugs and errors in the game. What you shouldn't probably do is by this for 300 plus dollars LOL.Anyway, this sits there with the Lunars, Grandia, Arc the Lad, Alundra, Wild ARMs, and a couple others as the best RPGs the PS1 had to offer. Extremely playable to this day in an emulator. Better than you will ever see it look emulated through a modern system on a console, meant for purchase. These games look and play exquisitely through an emulator and that is where you should be revisiting them if possible. Filters make the sprites look near perfect and there are many to choose from. Amazing how PS1 RPGs hold up and many of the PS1 and even PS2 3D games look awful in comparison. The same could be said for 2D games on the 16 bit systems; a joy to behold. xBRZ filters and their brethren have made a lot of these games timeless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QPHBGNFRQQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001X50L#wasThisHelpful","R4QPHBGNFRQQG","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not even that great at these games but they are still treasured classics. Playing them now with a nice filter on ePSXe could not be more fun.

"For people like me you want a good transfer for your bluray collections. The main film here, Silence, is just another MPEG-2 transfer from the old HDDVD days. I for one cannot believe they haven't revisited such a classic release. It seems they might be doing that in the next year or two though. Hannibal is the same way, a lesser film but one that is nonetheless pretty decent just with an average at best MPEG-2 transfer. Manhunter, a film I find to be fairly dated--I have no idea why it still gets so much praise--has the only modern transfer yet looks fairly average at best. At least they all have lossless soundtracks.For 7.99 I'd say if you really want to see these go ahead. I have no intention of paying for old stuff thrown on a disc though. I'll wait for proper masters. The only film you REALLY need here is Silence and it doesn't look all that great to be honest.

"I always trust this for my car. Yet I don't use it all that often as I don't think modern engines that are efficient and mostly clean already really need it on a regular basis. This also isn't going to save your engine or anything. It can only do so much in the fuel system. What it will do is make your driving experience as smooth as possible. I use it every 40k or so. When I was using it too often, and in my 13g tank, it may have contributed to a failure of an early failure of an oxygen sensor that wasn't made very well. Not the product's fault really but mine because this treats 21g and it is strong. It's one of the best products on the market along with their MOA for oil. I recommend both.

"This worked perfectly. My first mold turned out okay, but my second one is the most comfortable mold I have ever had for my teeth. I have a problem with clenching or bruxism, and this has so far been THE most comfortable product I have used for my medium to large mouth.MY ONE warning is that after boiling water you do not need to wait 20 seconds. I think for me in MN it is more like 7 seconds and no more. I made a perfect fit by lightly biting down after taking it out with a cold metal tongs. I can sleep with this in my mouth. I made it for the top teeth to set it as that is more comfortable for most. I give this product five stars. I have one mold left. The first one was okay and it works but I didn't push on the mold enough and didn't indent my teeth in it enough for it to be as comfortable as my second one.After the boiling water was left to sit for about 5 seconds I dipped the piece in fully for 7 seconds, as it then was starting to curl, and then I took it out and basically put it my mouth and used my fingers to place just how I wanted.

"My favorite Curcumin supplement out there. Sure, you may not absorb everything but it's my opinion that if you are not treating cancer these are still helpful in the long run. There is simply too much evidence about the good effects of this supplement even in smaller doses, not to mention a whole host of ancient literature that has prescribed some for of this for thousands of years. Curcumin and it's main source Turmeric have been used for so long that it would be stupid to think they are simply a useless supplement imo. This one has black pepper to aid digestion and assimilation and I'd say so far this is my new favorite company for everyday supplements and few of these plant extracts.

"I feel like being an objective review, so I can't totally recommend this for 60 bones, but then again I rarely can say that for any game. The Order is painfully short because you want more, you need more, and in the end there isn't more.... yet. We can only hope for a sequel. So I will try my best to posit some semblance of  a decent review.First of all, if this game is a 5 or 6 out of ten, then games like COD, Asscreed, and Halo: MCC, which I own broken still to this day, are nothing more than the same scores dressed up with 9s and 10s because people are getting paid. For some odd reason this game is being picked apart by an industry that just doesn't seem to be able to handle graphical innovation very well.But it sure can handle broken games and POS campaigns with no objective sense in them.... because well IGN and Eurogamer and the rest rate all these other games quite highly; only now have they even given any inclination to being even slightly critical about these franchise games. When an industry shills us a Halo game that is still broke after three months with 9s, 10s, and everything else you know something is wrong with said industry. It just ain't tellin' the truth for whatever reason.To the game: What else need be said about the visuals. As a high-end PC owner these visuals compete with anything I have ever seen on PC, though it obviously only runs at 30FPS... and pretty solid at that. You can say what you will about the length of the game but what we have here is a technical showcase that at least needs to be seen by just about everyone that calls themselves a gamer. I say the same thing for each new Crysis game and each new game in general that pushes graphical fidelity forward.There is honestly no other game with such macro detail to objects. The shaders are getting Hollywood-like here and no other dev so far has put forth such a presentation that is as consistent across the board. Anywhere. The IQ seems about on par with a normal downsampling option in a PC game with some added AA here and there. It's a little softer but still ultra-gorgeous and clear for the most part. You will not confused this with sub-hd. Shadows are amazing and feature high-resolution and accurate detail not seen in any console game to this degree as of now.The black bars obviously enable them to push more with less but they are at least natively displayed on a 1080p screen and actually give the game a fairly cool 'lens' that the devs have worked in their favor. I expect the few people with 21:9 screens are going to love this game ever more. You can always zoom on your TV if you really want to be rid of the bars. The game even looks good on a zoom option believe it or not. I've actually considered getting one of these TVs, if I have money lying about, just for film and possibly a few games like this one.As for the 60 dollar thing.... it all depends on what you are doing. Huge backlog? Maybe wait a few months and pick it up at 30. Casual gamer that just wants a fun romp with insane visuals? It is probably worth it. I have no problems with the gameplay other than they needed more environements to explore. They needed us to really feel the city for it to be one of the greats, and we needed a few more things to do around the city. It doesn't have that oomph and I have to dock a star for it. I can't give this game a six though. In 6 months the game will be 30 bucks and my review would look completely asinine and lame. The game is worth it. If it gets a sequel even doubly so.... you can't miss a product like this whether you rent or buy.It's more Gears of War than Uncharted, and it brings with that moniker all the things you associate with cover shooters. It does it well with a little too much hand holding. All of these things for me are usually expected with a developer's first big game. I fully think their inevitable second game is going to be so much better, kind of like many other games such as Uncharted that were totally dwarfed by their sequel.All in all the game is a mind bender. Insane graphics that make you want a 100 hour game. You just gotta sort through all the fanboy nonsense and BS being spewed by people who cannot handle a game being crowned as the new graphic king. I can see people rating it a 6. But 5s and 4s? Nah, that is just pure clickbait at its finest. I can also see people who look beyond price, rating it a 9. Storytelling it does pretty well. The dialogue is decent enough, and for a videogame it nears the top of the heap. It just doesn't quite feel complete enough to me and it ends too quickly.All in all this game was needed by the industry. We always need the people that are going to push the graphical innovations. I don't want to be stuck playing Pong for 30 years. I want to move forward. And Ready At Dawn has done something to move the industry forward. They didn't quite hit their mark on the first game, but I think they totally deserve a second chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PDLLBZ2ABOYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBLBMBQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PDLLBZ2ABOYK","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Definitely a positive experience here. The graphics are pretty good, though there are noticeable jaggies in some places. It is usually good looking and does its job well. The sound is okay, the story is decent to good, and the platforming is pretty fun. More of a combat/platformer without too much in the way of super complex jumping segments.I don't really like how the different Knacks you can get have to be used on different playthroughs. I wish the devs could have incorporated all the Knacks into the actual game. You only get so many relics so if you want to play with the other Knacks then you have to play multiple times. And really I don't see the point. I have absolutely zero intention of playing through this again. On hard the game is only mildly challenging from time to time. The story isn't that great and all in all it's very linear. Gamers amaze me with their patience, or obsession, in completing menial tasks and then doing them over and over again for little gain. For what it is this is a solid 20 dollar title.I should mention you can even shareplay this with a friend and play Coop throughout the story!

"I feel like I need to write a review to balance out all these reviews of the condition of the book. This book is terrible for someone that wants to be led through each section slow and steady with optimum examples and reasoning corresponding directly to the examples. The 'appendix' for each section, especially complex sections like Phonology, is painfully short.It has exercises but absolutely no way to understand how to do those exercises except within the framework of the main definitions of the book and the aforementioned appendix sections. Think of it like a math book with no answers and very few examples on how to work your way through the various problems presented. A study guide is usually very helpful with math but I find it absolutely necessary here.In short I find this book lacking for sections like Phonology. IMO you need the study guide or it's not going to be as clear as it needs to be. I guess with a great teacher and the book it is possible to work your way through it, but for me I was hoping for more.TLDR: Get the study guide.

"Wow, the reviews on this website for a great film.... never fail to make me laugh. Apparently, with this film the audiences of America thought they were going to get an emotionally--read soap opera--inviting film with everyone having a great time and also a happy ending. For what it is worth rampart is an actual word too. Just saying.... it may have some meaning to the film beyond the police department, as some people seemed to think the film should have been more about this whole scandal.Woody gives one of his very best performances. In fact, all the performances are great. The whole film flows very well to me. Not getting the complaints about the flow of the story at all. It follows this man around during various portions of his daily dealings and introduces us to his home life. It's pretty simple and straight-forward to me. Especially egregious and surprising is not one mention hardly of the excellent father/daughter screenwriting in this film, in all its horrible glory. No, nothing in this film is meant to entertain you really. It's about immersion, it's about coming to grips with reality in a very negative situation.Dealing with Race, Police, Relationships, Brutality, etc. No other film has been this honest for a while about some of these events. It's apparent that most Americans would rather live in a fantasy. It's honestly appalling reading some Amazon reviews. The ignorance is so ridiculous that it becomes a farce just reading through them for me. While not a perfect film, more like 4 stars, I have to give it the fill five here to balance out heavies below. Apparently, this film was badly marketed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z1DIZJ52O2FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AJMC4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2Z1DIZJ52O2FT","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Say Anything is a great film. Probably still Crowe's best film. As you get into the lives of the characters and identify with them, the film becomes more personal. Crowe leads Cusack and Skye to a pair of their best performances, despite their youth. The writing is what brings out the virtuosity in the talents at hand but the soul and heart of the film is in the acters and their ability to play the leads near perfectly.Not much more to say.

"I got the 770 4GB for a little under 450 dollars. I loved that card and the windforce design. This card is better, has a backplate, and is overall pretty much the same type of experience I had with that card. The 970s are savvy, powerful, and well-made. I have no coil whine on my 1.0 revision. I also use a nice Corsair 750w power supply. This thing is a beauty and actually smaller than I pictured. It is long though with the backplate though so make sure it fits. I for one love it.The major differences from my last experience are that this card retails for 360 dollars and has the performance edge by a mile on high-resolutions and anti-aliasing performance. And after one year and half, a long duration in the tech world at times, the 770 just wasn't quite cutting it with what I wanted: more MSAA, downsampling, supersampling, and also some of the other options like SSAO and high shadows and post processing.Also, because of memory configurations and the new chipset, the 970 uses 3.5GB of its RAM as the main stack and .5 more for lower bandwidth. So far it hasn't been a problem for me at all as the performance is ridiculously better than the 770. My stable overclock right now is a 1404 MHz core with boost, 1853MHz on the memory pool, and +15mV on voltage. It puts the 770 to shame and for much less money.Like people with more tech knowledge than me have said, a lot of it comes down to the design of the card. It has near double the ROPs and near 1/3 more transistors as well compared to the 770. This has to play into what I am seeing in performance, as I can FINALLY play Far Cry 3 with Ultra except High for Post FX, MSAA on 4x or 2x if you want better performance, and more importantly the HDAO on, which is the only good looking SSAO option in game. This with 1080p and it looks amazing. Almost a buttery smooth 60FPS even at 4xMSAA. A couple hiccups here and there.Those settings murdered my 770 for the record. The 970 usually runs through it with only a trip here and there. Fantastic I say. The performance goes on and on. This card is simply a better design all around. I paid a lot for my 770, but I did sell it back for a half as the 4GB version is still a decent card. I have no qualms about it. I love the upgrade. Totally worth it. Just make sure you have a nice power supply. And be sure to get more info on the 3.5GB RAM partition to make sure it doesn't affect your gameplay.Really, this card for me is a transition card. If you are keeping a card for say 4 years, simply don't buy the 900 series at all. If you are keeping this card for 1 year, two years max, then it's totally worth it, especially if you are gaming on your backlog or with games that are current. I assume in 2-3 years games will require more than 4GB of GPU RAM so keep that in mind.All in all the performance was too hard to pass up. I sold my 770 for decent money and paid about 100 more to upgrade this. Well worth it in every way. Just watch out for the 3.5GB RAM line and you are fine. An upgrade to the '1070' is in my future when Nvidia releases the 16nm designs because quite honestly the power of this one card with even full 4GB is not enough to sustain much past another year or so in technology.Ultra settings will be boosted accordingly as consoles are already upping the bottom line by a high standard. Expect 6-8GB of RAM usage in the next 2 years or so. For what you get here this is a great temporary upgrade. All the people that are whining about the .5GB seem to think the card was going to last them for years or something. That is ridiculous. There are already huge limits on this card that will be easily overcome with Nvidia's 16nm cards, which we will probably hear about in the winter. I find the 900 series to be just another solid step in progress line. It's cheap and offers great performance on just about anything out today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XL3011C2GP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH5T1MS#wasThisHelpful","R5XL3011C2GP0","A26N27LJVQNVI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26N27LJVQNVI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Whoever controls the artifact will win the war. Unfortunately, Adele is up against a much more knowledgeable foe.First, let me preface my review by saying I’m a total Vampire Empire fan girl.

When I heard about the The Geomancer's release, I was thrilled with the prospect to dive back into this amazing world…I was not disappointed.There was quite a few, I didn’t see it coming and even better, some amazing character developments that left me in awe of how it was masterfully handled. The possibilities are endless and leave you contemplating the what ifs long after you turn the last page.The Geomancer is a dark steampunk fantasy that had me white knuckle reading and leaving me wanting more.

Reeve now must prove that she is the good person to herself and those around her.The cop and criminal, both needing something missing in their lives, Better When He’s Brave is the story of Reeve and Titus finding that something.Life in the Point is dark and intense and definitely not for the light hearted reader.I found Better When He’s Brave to be suspenseful, packed full of plenty of romantic steam while still managing to balance the action, love and real life drama.The characters are genuine and their plight heartfelt but the overall tone was a little to dark and the topics they face to cringe worthy for me.I received this ARC copy of better When He's Brave from William Morrow Paperbacks in exchange for a honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUQN5IOFH53C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062385925#wasThisHelpful","RMUQN5IOFH53C","A2AQ7NZKYI10IS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AQ7NZKYI10IS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In terms of bluetooth speakers, I own a Jabra mini, Jambox mini, Big Jambox and a Bose Soundlink III. I would rate this Philips as ahead of the Jabra mini and Jambox mini in terms of sound quality and volume. The Philips is slightly larger than the the Jabra and Jambox but the sound is much better and worth the extra size. The sound seems much crisper at higher volumes. The 360 sound is perfect for any room or even outdoors since it's omni directional. The speaker itself is very easy to pair and then there is a twist dial which serves as the power and volume control. It's great that the speaker is splash proof so you don't have to be as careful. You can stand the speaker vertically or horizontally so it fits really anywhere you want it to. It does not come with a case but it feels pretty rugged so you can just toss it in your backpack and go. If you really want volume though, the Big Jambox (way bigger and more expensive) is the loudest of any of the speakers I have owned/tried. Overall though, I would choose this Philips speaker for it's size and sound quality at higher volumes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTPV90MVWW53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GBRSUO#wasThisHelpful","R2DTPV90MVWW53","AZAC8O310IK4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZAC8O310IK4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far the lightest weight stroller that I have used that wasn't an umbrella stroller. We have a 2+ year old toddler and we have been using it around town lifting it in and out of our SUV. Some of the great features are that it is very lightweight and easily foldable even one handed to put into the car. There are 2 ways to collapse the stroller, the most convenient being a twist action on the handle. When you twist you simply collapse the whole stroller. The stroller maneuvers fairly well and can get in and out of crowded areas pretty well. The seat also reclines quite a bit so it makes for easy napping. The wheels have a pretty interesting locking mechanism in that you lock the wheels by pushing down on 1 side of the wheels and unlock on the other side. The undercarriage provides ample storage for the size of the stroller. Now for the some of the bad issues, I am an ok height at 5'9"" and I feel pretty comfortable with the handle position but the handle is quite high and I can imagine someone shorter might feel pretty uncomfortable (the handlebar is not adjustable). The canopy provides decent coverage but does not go that far down as to provide full coverage. The last negative is that there is quite a bit of lateral movement in the frame structure if you make a really sharp turn (there is some flex in the frame). Overall though, our toddler seemed very content in the stroller and I would probably recommend this to friends that are taller and were looking for the lightest weight stroller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GPRTJC0H13N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VA0CGP6#wasThisHelpful","R4GPRTJC0H13N","AZAC8O310IK4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZAC8O310IK4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The toy comes with the main stage with a tree top, washing station and scale. Of course these are all pretend. It also comes with a talking elephant which has a moveable snout and legs. The sound from the elephant comes from pulling his tail or pushing the mouse. There is also a monkey, a zookeeper and girl that comes with it. There are also 2 balls that represent ""elephant food"".

"For the price and the compact foldable form factor, these noise cancelling headphones are pretty good! I just traveled with them on the plane and while they aren't as good as my over the ear noise cancelling headphones. I have the Bose noise cancelling headphone but these worked pretty decently. They drowned out quite a bit of the engine noise and I was able to listen to my music peacefully. The headphones run off 1 AAA battery so those are easily findable  There is also a monitor button so that you can temporarily turn off the noise cancelling feature. What I did like the most was that they are so packable versus my huge Bose noise canceling. I have to clip my Bose ones to the side of my bag because they won't fit anywhere else. At least these I can just slip into any of the pockets in my briefcase. Overall, I would buy these for traveling if you are looking to give up some performance for convenience!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R313W460MACHVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028E4SF4#wasThisHelpful","R313W460MACHVL","AZAC8O310IK4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZAC8O310IK4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These glasses are nice if you are entertaining outside and don't want to worry about anyone dropping their glass and shattering. They are definitely a step up from drinking out of a red SOLO cup.

It comes with a toy flat head screw driver, hammer, wrench, saw and ruler. In addition, there's the toolbox which makes sound to encourage putting the toolbox back together.

"I really like this bluetooth scale in that it is incredibly easy to set up and use. You literally take it out of the box and then you put the batteries in. Then you download the iHealth 2.0 app (for some reason there's a 1.0 but don't use that one). The only hang up for some people is that it prefers you to register with the iHealth website but I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Once you get the app set up, you just tap the scale to wake it up and then it pairs to your bluetooth device (iPhone 5S for me) and then after it registers your weight it transfers to your phone automatically. It does calculate BMI but it's based strictly on your height and age. Overall, I really like the scale for it's ease of use and accuracy. I know the scale is accurate because I've tested it against 3 other scales in our home and they are all pretty close! I plan to use this scale to help me lose some weight since I can see trends through the app and set goals!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SQJ7OB7KLSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF7DB1U#wasThisHelpful","R18SQJ7OB7KLSK","AZAC8O310IK4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZAC8O310IK4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's been pretty hot this summer in southern CA and boy has this fan been amazing. The fan has so many features that I haven't seen in a standing fan including a tilt option. When you first open the box, the fan comes with the fan unit and then the base. The base is very easy to assemble and connect to the fan with 4 screws. Then you simply plug in and you're off and running. There is a remote control which can control all options (except tilt, that is manual). There is a dial on the unit for controlling the speed, an on/off button, and timer. There is another button which controls the type of fan speed you want, it's actually pretty cool because you can set it for ""sleep"" mode which actually cycles the fan so that it's just not constantly blowing. The tilt feature is also very neat in that you can point the fan upwards at an angle to help circulate air more efficiently. Probably the best part of this fan is that it is incredibly slim and doesn't have a large footprint. Another thing of note which is nice is that the entire fan does not rotate but rather the unit itself is stationary and there is a fan within the outside unit which rotates!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17SGJW8D24GI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010814IYO#wasThisHelpful","R17SGJW8D24GI1","AZAC8O310IK4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZAC8O310IK4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So first off, our toddler loves this bottle because of the monkey sleeve. It also matches the rest of our Skip Hop collection. As for keeping his milk cold, it does a great job and the straw is easy to use. In addition the bottle is easy to clean. Now the major issue that we have is the lid, it is very hard to open or close and feels very flimsy. Unlike the Thermos Foogo, the lid springs open and out toddler can drink out of it without our help. The Skip Hop lid is designed so that you have to push the latch and then lift the lid with your other hand (our toddler can't do that). As for closing the lid, it is very difficult in that it doesn't latch that securely, therefore sometimes it might pop open after a few seconds.

"I've never tried one of these pivoting head shavers and wow what a difference it makes! I've never had this close of a shave on my neck ever. The shaver is pretty standard from a charging standpoint, you can charge on the unit itself or you can put the AC plug into the cleaning unit base and then charge from there. Overall, this is probably the closest shave that I've had using an electric shaver and one of the reasons is that you basically can clean the shaver heads everyday with the cleaning base. This shaver comes with a cleaning base that has a cleaning solution which you pop into the base. Of course the downside is that you have to buy the refill cartridges every 3 months. For some people this might be a deal killer but if you shave everyday like I do, this is worth the expense! The shave also comes with a grooming attachment which does some pretty fine work on your sideburns and if you are trying to trim your beard!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Z6UVTN4I6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOTALG#wasThisHelpful","R4Z6UVTN4I6G","AZAC8O310IK4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZAC8O310IK4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great fast action plier tool, it's awesome that you can open 1 handed and the action is incredibly smooth and fast! There are 12 tools on the multitool all of which work very well. The 12 tools are as follows (they are all locking too):1. Pliers - work very well for pretty tough jobs2. Half serrated knife - typical SOG quality3. Large flathead screwdriver - most of these multitools have pretty this flathead screwdrivers4. Bottle opener5. Philips screwdriver6. Can opener7. Small flathead screwdriver8. Awl9. File10. Ruler11. Wire cutter12. Ok I had to look up the 12th one but I guess ""gripper"" is considered a tool which is the top of the pliersOverall this is a fantastic tool, the only downside might be that it is a bit heavy for EDC in your pocket.

"These knives were incredibly sharp out the box and the weight to them are great. You can tell that these are well made especially when cutting anything from meat to vegetables. The 8"" chef's knive by far the most useful, it is well balanced and the weight like I mentioned before makes it incredibly easy to cut through most things. The parer knife is the second one I use most for cutting fruit, that also is very ergonomic and makes it easy to cut the skin off of fruit. The scissors are very sharp but they do not come apart like other scissors that I have used (when the blades separate, it makes it much easier to clean. The bread knife like the others is incredibly sharp and slices right through the hardest of breads! This set also comes with a riveted serrated utility knife which I actually didn't know what it was for but after looking it up, it turns out that you use this knife for cutting things like bagels or stuff with a hard crust and it will cut without tearing. I tried it and it works! I tested the sharpner and it's pretty much a standard sharpening steel. Finally the is really nice, it really makes the knife set stand out. It's not a standard wood block but a white plastic resin which really pops on our dark granite counter!

A $100 belt will almost always be much nicer than a $29 belt.While I do not buy a lot of very expensive accessories, I like ones that look nice for the price.  This belt has a very nice buckle, superb.  Clean, modern, stylish.  The leather itself is just plain, no accents, stitches, understated, which is a preference for certain clothes.  The fact its reversable, brown and black, and has a nice buckle, for $29, I had to give it 4-5 stars.

"Wow.  First, I have been using Excel for 15+ years.  I thought I was good at using Excel, not GREAT, but good.  Seems I got the program to give me everything I wanted... kinda.  Like most people, and most companies, they rarely have the time to dedicate to further education of your tools...and software tools are ever evolving.  Excel is no exception.It was nice to read that our largest coruporations such as JP Morgan, also was/is using Excel in a very antiquated way.  My guess is, they too design the use of their software with people who find ways to get it done, but yet, are NOT fully aware of all the power and options u can create with Excel.  Excel is like a mixed bag of tools.  How successful those tools can be, depends on your creativity, imagination and knowledge that comes with books like this.I already got some great ideas from the examples in this book for my application.  I too have been an outdated user of Excel, kinda operating it like it was 2000, and not 2015.  I never updated my knowledge base as I updated the software ;)  This book gives excellent examples... of course, they are likely NOT be perfect for every application.  Instead, u combine bits and pieces of examples to build what works for you.  I love the concept of better interfaces, which now is termed Dashboards.  I really enjoy all the nicely designed Dashboards, it makes my spreadsheets appear inferior.

"Wow, what an incredible innovation.  I am an occasional ping pong player, not a competitive player, just a means to blow off steam.  I just had to try this!!  Its a gadget mans gadget for sure!It senses the ball strike from sensors below the table, so it knows which side the ball bounced last, hence who won the point.  If you hit long, it does not register a strike,  your opponent wins the point.  Of course, your opponent could have mistakenly hit it out of the air ;)  So some human intervention is still required.  This will take getting used to... why?  Mainly because,  we goof around a lot when we play, and the game thinks we are serious players ;)  Also, some strange things occur like when the ball nicks the corner of the table, (winner point) it did not sense the corner strike...no worries, easy to correct score... bottom line, if you learn to look at the score after each point, its a pleasant way to stop arguing over the score...the older we get, the more we keep saying, ""what""  I am up 5-3 not YOU!!  hee hee....  it happens, our minds drift.  Anyway, with a little adjustment period to avoid tricking the system, and an occasional correction, I am sure we will refine the process to maintain more accurate scoring.  I also like the notice to change sides... very clever.  Even  though I rarely switch sides.  Overall all, if you like ping pong, its hard not to appreciate the genius behind this.... of all the areas technology has chased, ping pong was prob. not high on Microsofts list of priorities....so Kudos to these niche markers who pursue such small markets.  A lot of technology for the price IMO...  I was torn between 4 and 5 stars.  If you like gadets, and you argue over the score when playing ping pong, u will prob. appreciate it !!

"I have used a lot of these in the past..., but, ALL have been Schage Z Wave locks.  My first Yale Zwave Lock.  I really appreciate the diversity this line offers.... with matching door handles, integrated lock / handle, etc.  So many options.  Also, keyed, and keyless.  One of the fears of keyless, was being locked out when the batteries die...however, a very clever 9V battery touch point is provided, to always have external power from the outside in the event of battery drain.  Batteries are a way of life with these locks, get used to changing them....or, in this case, keep a 9V in your car, so ur always safe.  Ridding the key, is a Major security improvement, as most thieves can pick a lock very fast these days.  So a lot of thought went into the design of this Zwave lock non keyed system.  Kudos to Yale Design Team.I have installed many of these, so I am not a good judge of how hard it is.... it becomes simple after your 5th one, I  barely need the instructions....but not so for your first install.  Very good instructions.  The unit looks very attractive, sleek and modern.  Keypad IMO is ideal for outside use, however, its black, so maybe direct sun contact is not ideal, u might toast your fingers.  I like the fully rubber coated num pad vs individual keys, which can get dirt and debris around each key.  I won't bore you with the digital set up, as u need to know about Zwave and programming of such, not very difficult if you are PC savvy.  After installation, this was up n running in 15 minutes.  I really like this auto lock feature, very clever... HOWEVER.... always make sure the door is fully closed if you are relying on auto lock, as if the dead bolt is NOT fully aligned, it will NOT lock.... a false sense of security - if your not careful...One thing to consider when choosing a digital lock.  There is motorized locks, such as this, and there is non motorized locks such as the Schlage and other lines.  There is pros n cons to both.  The motorized lock is simple, enter code, door unlocks...or use zwave app, and door unlocks.  However, the motor drains the batteries much faster vs. non motorized locks.  With a non motorized lock, the door unlocks by pulling a pin up, allowing the manual lock turn handle to spin (conventional lock mechanism).  So after entering the code, you must then spin the deadbolt handle to open the door.  Since its ONLY a pin that moves up n down and NO motor, the battery life is quite impressive, well over a year on 4 AA batteries with heavy use.Also, if you have any friction on the deadbolt with a motorized lock, the lock will drain the battery even faster, as it must overcome the friction.  So make sure installation is clean, then check if things has changed during the seasons as wood moves a bit with change of weather.  You can hear when there is friction as the noise of the motor changes, as its burdened by friction.Also, with a motorized lock, the motor can fail, so always be sure there is another way into the facility  Specially if no key back up.  I don't suggest motorized and keyless when there is only ONE access into the building.So lots of choices, u have to prioritize what is important to you.  If security is very important, keyless sure rids the biggest problems of pic'd locks.Very impressive product","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUUARKG1ONL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HS1O77G#wasThisHelpful","R1SUUARKG1ONL1","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using Cresent tools all my life... IN general they make good tools...NOT the best, NOT the worst, some are very good, some have been OK at best.  But to be fair, with Cresent, u get a lot of tool for the dollar spent.  This matters, as not everyone requires the BEST tools...not everyone uses their tools every day of their lives, so some small variances in the tools might bother a daily user, but not a weekend warrior...I was glad to see these appear on Vine, as I have been a Channel Lock fan for years... they kinda own this tool line being the original inventor.  I think a few of the other Vine reviewers were being very fair by stating these are NOT in the league of Channel locks... the jaws are not as long, and most importantly, the tool is very heavy and bulky.  The obvious reason is, they used a lower cost metal which requires more volume to create equal strength.  The benefit, of course, LOWER COST!  IMO, I think some reviewers miss this point... Cresent is not going after the Channel Lock user, but rather the mid user who will not use the tools hours every day.  In which case these small differences are minor....but the price differential is VERY significant!!!  So, I always try to evaluate a products price vs performance, and in this case, I was between a 4 - 5 rating.  A nicer finish would have pushed me to a 5.  I do like the nice and thick rubber coating, seems very durable and should stand the test of time...Overall, this kit is quite the value, 3 nicely sized angled pliers at a very reasonable price point.... so IMO, Crescent is still doing a great job at picking their market and providing high quality products at reasonable prices...backed up with excellent customer service.

"My first venture into vacuum tumbling meats with marinades .... I have nothing to compare this unit to.  I never even knew the existed!The premise is novel... create a vacuum in the canister which holds the meat and marinade.  The vacuum allows the marinade to better penetrate the meat.  At first, it thought... no way.  But, my first try at using Chicken Breasts with a lemon marinade, was a total success!I have tried marinading overnight, but the marinade never penetrated as well as using the Chard.  So, the key is a vacuum!  The tumbling simply keeps the marinade equally all over the meat, which solves the problem of marinade falling to the bottom of the bag or tray when you let it sit in fridge overnight.Its a nice size for family use, not too big, not too small, and you need very little prep time....easy to clean, but keep away from dishwasher.

I love the mini HD port for a 2nd display, great for desk use.  I will upgrade soon to accommodate this.... the unit has no fan, so I will sit the unit on a pc cooler when at my desk.  It gets very warm, but not excessively hot.  But the more you push these PC's, the hotter they run..and heat is the enemy for all PC's.  AT this thin size, an internal fan is not possible...I am a but clunky with Windows 10, but that is another story ;)Two USB 3.0 ports is nice... I never realized how blazing fast these ports are, till I hooked up an external hard drive in one. sheeesh!  The track pad is OK at best, but again, u must consider how thin and small this laptop is.  You can't have the BEST of all features, specially mechanical features,  and maintain the size this small... it works well enough in a crunch, otherwise, I use a small a mini microsoft BT mouse.  Battery life although rated at 10hrs, prob. less if you drive the machine hard... so far, I had it go 7 hours with no problems... so, again, considering its size, that is very impressive to me.Screen colors are excellent considering the size...sure, my $2K desktop LED displays are better, but, they are HUGE... to pack this much light in such a tiny display is again, impressive.  No lag on display when working with files in Photoshop.  Asus mentions 178 deg viewing angle... not sure about that, but its better than any other laptop I have ever used... at least 120 deg with the best views being in the 80 deg range from center (+/- 40 deg).  The ""ac"" vs. ""n"" wifi connections is NOTICEABLY faster... but, that is not unique to this PC, but rather, just upgraded technology to the entire industry.  256GB Solid state hard drive... very generous size considering PC size and its thinness.  Its very fast... and with USB 3.0 port, easy to carry a larger drives which are very compact these days.Overall, Assus has packed an amazing amount of the latest and greatest features and offer it a very impressive price point.  The mixture of all this, its hard for me NOT to give this pc 5 star rating.  I know other reviewers are much harder on each feature, but IMO, u have to evaluate the price vs. performance ratio of the product, vs. what other competitors have to offer.  Sure, there is better laptops, but they get bigger and way more costly.Will try to update this review in due time after more use...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36J3VU9JQJ0MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KKANTE#wasThisHelpful","R36J3VU9JQJ0MM","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This appears to be a very high end product for Artists.  I am a photographer, and never could paint or illustrate.  However, I always had a desire to turn my photographs into paintings.  This software, like many high end graphics programs has so many facets, often users only utilzie maybe 10% of the programs capability.  That is certainly the case with me on program like this, as I have had no previous experience.  My initial impressions, are WOW.  I find it incredible how the software converts photos into paintings, and even more impressed with how many tools we have to manipulate the conversion.  I can see this program taking years to master.... as I need to master the understanding the final product...and get a better feel of how I want the final art to look.  I can see already, this will come through much experimentation.Being a Photoshop user doesn't seem to offer a lot of help for a program like this, as photoshop is quite precise, almost mathematical vs. Painter....but then again, photography is very mechanical vs. creating a painting from a blank canvas.  Hopefully I will learn more and update this review, as it will take me months to get a good grip on all these tools.  Unfortunately I don't work on this full time.  I am sure there is other programs out there that does these conversions as well, but having never used them, I can't offer a comparison.

"Otter really is atop the ""protection"" market...not only do their products protect BETTER than their competition, they continue to innovate more features into their design.  IMO, this is the crowning achievement of all of OTTER's design.  It's a one size fits all solution protecting your Ipad.  In my case, I often use mine with a keyboard for email, other times, I just want it upright for viewing video cams, other times, just carry on board the plane.  Of course, you have to buy the accessories, but you only buy the ones you want.... and while some might find them costly, IMO, they are cost effective considering the high quality of the product.  I will surely buy the dock.Some reviewers had problems with adhesive, so far, mine has not had this problem.  The look is industrial sleek, and open / close is a little clunky, but not enough to ding a point.Overall, this will prob. be the new standard for tablet protection... Once u adapt to the Agility Otter system, u will only have to buy new protector for each new sized ipad generation, as I am sure Otter will keep all the matching components compatible.  That IMO is a win / win... win for Otter, they get our repeat business, win for us, we can use the other accessories for many years to come.  Kudos to Otter Design team on this one!!Now, to be fair, if you only want mild protection, and do not use your Ipad except for couch lounging for example, this Agility Portfolio is prob. overkill for your needs.

"I have bought hundreds of B+W filters through the years, they are by far, IMO, the best filter maker on the market.  This Kaesemann filter IMO is a breakthrough circ. polarizing filter, as not only does it have classic B+W quality, it uses a new type of glass treatment that reduces light loss by up to 2 stops.  Loosing only 1 stop of light for a circ. polarizer is a big deal.  Specially when shooting fast moving subjects with glare, such as swimmers, water skiing, snow skiing, etc.As with all B+W products, the threads are meticulous and the movement is smooth as silk, with very tight tolerances...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXYPHSOGRMPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R69839S#wasThisHelpful","R2WXYPHSOGRMPH","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Box is big and HEAVY, be prepared for two man lift.  I own a  lot of Delta ww gear, nearly all of it, is very high quality.  I rate most of it as good as, and some better than Powermatic, two excellent USA makers...of course, no tools are actually made in the USA.  The mid tier gold standard for tool manufacturing is now Taiwan, which is where this Delta is made.  Assembly was smooth.  Anyone buying this product, knows how to read instructions and assemble something like this.  Lifting the motor is the only two man part of assembly.  Like all Delta products, the unit runs well.  Noise is ""as expected"", but if you have never used a unit like this, be sure to listen to one first, as neighbors can complain, they are loud.  But then again, so is a Table Saw ;).  Love the hip level switch, no bending.  Heavy duty build.  Height is made to just barely fit within an 8ft ceiling... at 93"", u have 3"" to spare max, assuming no drop lights.  CFM at 1200, this is the most you can expect at 120V and 15amps.  Delta offers a 5 year warranty on this unit, SUPERB, Delta stands behind their products.  I like the 6"" hose connection, which can Y into two 4"", as often some machines do have a 6"" dust port, so nice feature.  To properly size a dust collector, u must know what the CFM requirement is at the tool, and work backwards from there.  Calc. losses from the dust collector to the machine as every foot of hose, bend, etc. all reduces CFM...the reductions are extreme...even the type of pipe used matters a LOT.... for example, clean PVC pipe has less friction than flexible hoses.  There is good resources on the web about how to calculate losses...its important u buy a machine that meets your needs the FIRST time.I have owned several of these portable dust vacs.  For those new to this, picking the right type of dust collector is paramount.  This type of unit, is ideal in applications that require you to move the dust collector to different machines.  They are also ideal where you only have 120V, vs. 220V.  This is about the max. vacuum suction u can achieve at 120V power supply.  If you have only used a shop VAC in the past, be prepared for some serious suction, no comparison.  If you have no need to move the shop VAC around, a wall mounted VAC saves floor space...and if you have 220V, you can buy up to 5HP cyclone arrange and run duct work to each machine.  The more powerful the VAC, the more losses it can sustain through resistance losses through the ducting, WHILE, still having sufficient CFM at the ww machine.  So for 120V on wheels, this Delta 50-767 is more than sufficient for any ww machine with a 4"" dust collection fitting as if the machine is very close to the Delta, there is little loss of suction.  Never under estimate how fast suction is lost by hoses, specially hoses smaller than 4"" diameter.  Also, with a unit like this, you can set up some adapters and run some shop Vac hoses off it, for other smaller tasks like car vacuuming, etc.The premise of these units is similar to a cyclone, without the circular action...  gravity drops the dust and chips down into the collection bag, while air escapes through the top bag.  The tighter the bag (lower micron rating) the more dust that gets trapped, but less suction.  The looser the bag (higher micron rating), less resistance =  greater suction.  The 1200 CFM rating is with the included 1 micron bag.  This is a critical issue for two reason.  First, with greater suction, the further you can run hoses.  With better filtration, the shorter you can run hoses, but the air escaping the filter bag has less particulate matter, measured in ppm.Since there is several good reviews on the operation of the unit... I would like to write more about health consequences of dust, and ways to best reduce your exposure to fine dust particles.The internet is full of information on this subject...but in a nutshell, for wood workers...It is NOT just the heavy, or large airborne particulate that causes health problems.  Instead, its the < 5 micron size particles that have proven to have the most damaging health effects.  This was first discovered in grain plants, where breakfast cereals were made... u would think since grain is a food we eat, grain dust would not be toxic (vs. wood dust).  However, even fine grain dust from cereal making was producing crazy high levels of lung cancers.  Now, all grain plant workers wear filtration masks.The value of dust collection is to remove the dust at the tool u are working at.  If sized right, and the with the proper dust collection set up at the tool, they do a very good job at this, but not perfect, hence why I still use a dust mask.  Using a particulate meter will easily demonstrate this.  But this air is being pulled from the ww machine into the dust collector..and then, sent back into the room through the top filtration bag.  Unfortunately, what is being sent back into the room is the very fine, invisible < 1 micron size particles.  With no outside air flow in your shop (like many basement shops), the invisible particulate matter begins to accumulate, this is dangerous.  This Delta comes with a 1 micron bag.  You can buy other bags at different micron ratings, such as 3 or 5 which are common.So, the measures to make your dust collection as safe as possible....In order of significance....1)  Place the dust collector in a location where the exhaust air does NOT re-enter the work space...such as an accessory shed u build on the outside wall of your shop or garage.  A good place to put an air compressor too, which is quite noisy.  You can sound insulate this room.  This allows all the small particulate to leave the dust bag into the outside, vs back into your work space / lungs.  If this set up is possible, you can than change the filtration bag to a 5 or 10 micron bag, and the added suction will allow you to run long hoses to your machines and have the same net suction.  This is by far the most ideal dust collection set up....  of course, not always feasible.2)  If the dust collection unit remains in you shop, and the exhaust air dumped into your work space... have windows or doors open with fans, always moving out the invisible particulate.  In a basement, simply build a fresh air intake system with some duct work, and an exhaust fan to pull air out.  In cold weather, this can add to heating costs.  If you use the shop a lot, and it the cost can justify it, consider a ERV, (Energy Recovery Ventilator), these will salvage about 85% of the nrg content of the inside air u are exhausting.3)  If this is not possible, at a bear min. use an overhead, shop dust collector such as a Delta 50-871.  These are also 1 micron air cleaners.... remember, there is a lot of dust that still escapes these units at the machine and other tasks like drilling holes, etc. that we often never use dust collection.  So the over heard units really do a great job of continually cleaning the air.4) Any extreme dust generating task, like sanding, Table Saws, re saw on band saw, planars.... use a good 3M cartridge based dust mask while performing the task, of course, with heavy duty dust collection working.  Belt sanders are nearly impossible to capture the dust.Hope this sheds some light on all the different options for dust collection to assist in maximizing dust removal and reducing the risk of dust related health effects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Q9FD9NMC9ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146RKJRQ#wasThisHelpful","R17Q9FD9NMC9ZH","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love tool gadgets... I am no stranger to these laser levelers.... to be fair, at this price point, its a unique product for sure.I am curious what the maker had in mind when this product was designed...most levelers are made for specific tasks...The cool factor lies in the units size!  tiny!  6"" flashlight size...  The smaller the product, the more compromises have to be made in its capability.... the maker used a plumb bob type of self leveling system.... when the internal plumb bomb settles, the line is suppose to be level... well, within the makers tolerance.  Mine was slightly further out of tolerance than the maker suggested, but not enough to complain.  How well the plumb bomb performs over time, temp, getting banged around, etc, ??  It was smart to dial in a lock position, assuming people use it, this is very helpful..... making the lock integrated with the legs would have been a nice safety feature to assure when the unit is closed down, it will lock....I think some people will struggle with the concept here.... as u set down the laser with its wobbly legs, u have this desire to make it level, but that is not required, as its self leveling (within  4 deg surface vs. level)  However, when you then spin the unit, u then have to wait for the plumb bob to settle, which takes some time... so pros n cons to this method...If there is one area I would like to see this product improved...its the ability to move the horizontal line up/down, without moving the unit up / down..this might be hard to accomplish at this price point...but u immediately desire this, unless u are only working with the vertical line.  Regardless, there is always work arounds, like measuring, story sticks, etc.Overall, clever product, fits a niche in the laser level market...

"this is an incredible replica of the early 1900's binocs... It requires a lot of precision optics and machining to make a product like this...only Nikon or Canon could make such a product and sell it for this low price point.  However, as a pair of useful Binocs, they are average at best... why?  A few reasons.... first, the light is folded through an extra prism to accommodate this design... which can slightly degrade the image quality.  Next, for this price, u don't get Zeiss like glass, so contrast is mediocre at best.  The exit pupil is 2.5mm, so it requires perfect alignment with your eye pupil in sunlight, when your pupil is stopped down to about 2-2.5mm.  So you get a lot of black-out effect, or vignetting whereas the exit pupil (light circle from binocs)  is missing your eye pupil opening...  The eye relief is very short, not good for eyeglass wearers.So, to be fair...if you want this for your coffee table as a conversation piece, I would give it 5 stars, as its truly an amazing replica for the price.  But if your looking for a good usable pair of 6x binocs, these will have inferior views to most binocs in this price range, or even much less.  U are paying for added prisms, and sophisticated metal machining....Also, since the light path does not extend outward like normal binocs of this size, i.e. two straight tube monoculars.... the point at which you hold the binocs is very close to your eyes, vs. further away from your body...this makes keeping them still very difficult.  The further out you hold the binocs, the less effect hand shake as on the image.  double the hold distance, u cut the shake effect in half, the relationship is linear.  Even at 6x, I have a horrible time holding the image still vs. tubular binocs at 6x.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39J2ZHFA3IJMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ETQQBO#wasThisHelpful","R39J2ZHFA3IJMZ","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like large national brands, they have more to loose if something goes wrong, so I suspect they have better quality controls.  I have been using this Curcumin for the past year, on and off, like most supplements, I get tired of taking them.  As many have read, this is suppose to be a miracle natural ingredient found in tumeric... there seems to be a mountain of evidence it reduces inflammation, and now, inflammation of the cells is new ""cholesterol""... it makes sense, but as with all these buzz words, they often fade over time.  However, I tend to stick to the items whereas humans have been consuming them for thousands of years.... and although Tumeric has been consumed as a spice for all these years, its never been taken in massive quantities like we do with these supplements, i.e. where they extract a very small component of the tumeric and place it in a capsule....so humans could never consume this much Curcumin in the form of Tumeric as a spice.  Whether that has some negative effects, I guess science and trial and error will teach us.  Till then, like other posters have mentioned, I too am hedging my bet on this one.

"I have about 6 of these in my garage and office,  where I am always short on outlets.  I would say Woods makes one of the better units in the ""consumer"" market.  For even better office protection, Belkin units are even more robust and offer additional protection...expect to pay up to 2x more.  This is for outlets only, not phone, dsl, ethernet, etc.  If you need that protection as well, look for a multi use outlet.  For business use, there is even better units by GE, Belkin and others.One reviewer mentioned the outlets are too close together.... Considering there is 8 outlets on this model, I would say it was a fair compromise, as the last two outlets have large spacing, for larger transformers.  If they all had this much spacing, the unit would become too large.  they make short pigtail extenstions, like 15"" that you can buy that solves this problem, so you take the extension, and plug in the transformers away from the 8-Outlet.  I think this is the right solution, so the outlets don't become over-sized for most peoples use.  Never had any problems with Woods units yet and plan on buying more as my office and garage keep expanding.  Woods IMO offers the most value for the dollar... u see their products in Home Depot, so that tells u the value they offer, as Home Depot buyers really scrutinize ""value"" of a product...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R186VMQD7E9RGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZY07UG#wasThisHelpful","R186VMQD7E9RGU","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am new to electric razors... Since they were on Vine, hard to resist trying to become a CONvert vs. my Gillette Fusion blades, which I love.  While the Philips is incredible with how well these products are designed, packaged... I only took 1 star away, cause, as good as this is, the best blades IMO still get a closer shave.  BUT, if that is NOT a big concern, I can see why these are gaining in popularity.  The fact u can shave without cream, is helpful and faster...  With the new Fusion blades, going against the grain provides a level of closeness that is tough to beat.The contour of the head is very nice...seems to fit everywhere nicely, very comfortable...ergnomics in the hand, surperb.  Cleans relatively easy, but I am sure after awhile, added stubble build up, the cleaning tank will be required.  The process seems a bit cumbersome for my limited attention span for things like this.  The sideburn attachment is very nice as well, lots of power, easy cutting.  A bit cumbersome to install though, so I would prob. not use it.  I have a small dedicated unit for $20, less fumbling around with changing heads.  Footprint is small.  Looks cool, thats for sure!There has been some issues with other Norelco users about reliability of the heads... I never used them enough to have this problem, as I always seem to resort back to blades.  But u would think, if they are unreliable, the cost of the new heads will make these electric shavers very costly to use.For me, the real benefit of this unit is a fast shave, without using cream... the downside is, not quite as close...but, sometimes that is not an issue for me.  So maybe that will be its place for me...","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJV3GDSV7Q1Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","RJV3GDSV7Q1Y3","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using Flax seed oil since it was introduced over 25 years ago...some have very strong flavor... not usually tasty... but you consume Flax oil for Omega 3 health benefits..not flavor...I can NOT take fish oil supplements, so this is most Omega 3 I can consume, as its not abundant in many plant based foods.although maybe some find the Flax flavor tasty... most people would be happy if the taste of flax oil is tolerable...Alliga Flax oil is by far one of the least offensive ones I have used...and since its Organic and non gmo, I will switch over to this brand.  I am very surprised at the high heat rating.  Most Flax oils can not be heated as they de nature...I won't fry with it, unless on low heat, but will add it to soups...i often mix it with other oils, such as macadamia nut, for Omega 9.I do refrigerate my flax oil, as it seems flax oil spoils much faster than most other vegetable oils.Alligga charges a bit more, but the extra $ is well worth it considering they raised the max cooking temp, Organic and non GMO.. well done...

"This is may first Swiss Legend Watch.  I do admit, I like collecting watches as they are my only form of Jewlery ;)As much as technology has marched forward, it seems analog watches are still as popular as ever, strange, huh... all those mechanicals never got replaced by high tech electronics.The packaging and storage case is superb, so are the instructions.  Although, I don't use a watch for much, other than glancing at it and telling time.  But if you like all the twist dials and small inner timers, this watch will not disappoint.  While a few other reviewers mentioned this watch is too large for most men... I would somewhat agree...while I prefer a large face dial, this one is adequate, but its the thickness makes it quite the beast on your wrist.  And it has some weight as well.... its noticeable.  So, for those sensitive to heavy watches or watches that ""stand out"" due to size, this is not a good fit for you.Time setting was a little different, but the instructions take you through it... I did try to experiment with the inner dials, and they are too small for me to see well... the date is small as well.  The blue tint in person, is NOT as strong as the picture suggests, it has a very slight blue tint, noticeable, but not overwhelming.... a nice touch IMO.When you look at this watch, at first glance to the average person who is not a watch enthusiast, it can be mistaken for a watch MUCH more expensive... as those watch enthusiasts know, similar looking watches can cost thousands.  The best switch watches today cost over 6 digits!  So, I would surely say it passes the bling test, if that is what you are after!  And at this price point, that says a lot.Overall, this is a nice watch for the price, IF, you like em big n heavy and a want bling on your wrist.  Its not for everyone for sure... but a LOT of watch for the dollar....","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2730AYTDIAUHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJIR3HM#wasThisHelpful","R2730AYTDIAUHL","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to print fine art prints using many different types of epson printers.  I think the company makes excellent products and always innnovating.  This product is no exception in the innovation area...they are getting ahead of the curve IMO.So, the marketplace finally tired of these constant small ink cartridge prices...with prices ranging from dirt cheap to very high for OEM.  Some printers had chips on the carts, so you could not use 3rd party.  Its the old, make money on the consumables concept.  Epsons response is large refillable ink jet printer.  Refilling is quite simple, if you can follow directions ;)  The print count is quite impressive, see above product description... now, whether this is reality, most people never check.  Regardless, its quite the convience vs. constantly changing carts which held very little ink.  The description states, equal to 20 carts... well, that is quite impressive.  I have not seen price of the ink bottles, but it has to be waaay more cost effeftive than carts.In return for not buying carts, the makers willl make less money on consumables....so I imagine Epson had to charge more for the printer as the consumable revenues would be way less... and I think this is the case, you get less features for the cost vs. ""buy our cartridges"" type machines.  Fair enough IMO.  For example, no LCD disiplay?  Build is solid, which is an Epson trademark vs. the low cost compeitors.  Did not set up Wifi, so can't comment on that....The scanner works EXCELLENT, both text and photos.... Epson knows scanners well, they make some nice dedicated photo and text scanners.  The printer works, well, like most ink jet printers, so nothing new there, prints look sharp and crisp.  Paper tray holds 100 sheets, a bit light IMO, but, then again, the footprint of the printer is small... which is a major factor these days in such crowded home offices.Overall, the unit performs very well.... is compact, quiet, and considering the low cost for ink over its life, surely offsets the small price premium you pay for the printer.  If you print a lot, the cost effectiveness alone would make the initial cost a non issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MW30SK2HTWXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","R2MW30SK2HTWXA","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow!  First,  I weld as a hobby... I never owned a top notch helmet  like this, so its possible I am overwhelmed since I only have experience with lower cost masks.  This is my first auto darkening helmet as well, so what a treat.  I never knew this level of sophistication existed in welding Helmets.First, and most important is the ergononics... Once I got the adjustments right, it fit like a glove... no real pressure points, and most of all, the helmet is so light weight, I barely notice the weight vs. my other helmets.  I guess this really matters if you are welding all day...even my eye glasses I wear for my PC benefitted greatly by swtiching to Nikon lenses and ultra light frames, what a difference it makes on the bridge of your nose.  The mask can still get hot in the summer, so if you sweat a lot like me, you still need a head band to prevent the vewing area from getting wet.  Unless the helmet makers start installing AC systems,  this will always be a nuissance in hot weather.  Nothing unique to this maker.The auto darkening is quite the treat if you never experienced this before.  Damn, it darkens FAST!.  It is so much easier to work by not constantly flipping the mask, or filter, on and off to see when the welder is off.  The system does account for ambient light very well.  I have only used it in Weld mode, so I can't comment on the other modes.  I do appreciate how clear the viewing panel is... I imagine a lot of the cost of the helmet is in the viewing glass... to offer all these features and still be crystal clear is quite the engineering accomplishment.Excellent instructions, well written, nice to see this, so tired of illegible instructions.  Overall, very very impressed with the helmets performance!A friend of mine is a more serious welder, and he too was very impressed with the clarity, quick darkening, the modes of operation, and ergonomics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUOVDSV3A40V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00982XCB0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUOVDSV3A40V","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What makes these chairs unique vs. all others I have used... is how FLAT they fold!  Less than 3"", closer to 2.5""!  I am shocked the maker does not shine a spotlight on this feature, as in so many living quarters these days, space is at a serious premium.  4 of these together is 10-11"".  The material is very nice plastic, has a slight granite appearance...and appears to wash easy, making them OK for outdoor use, vs. folding chairs with fabric on them.  The load capacity might be an issue if you are a big person, as the legs don't seem to thick... another reviewer mentioned 275lb load capacity, if so, that is impressive considering how lean the chairs are.  Will make great use of these folders...

Well, its a bit better than the old version... faster steam times, love the foot on off pedal, nice size wheels for moving.  Very simple concept, steam removes wrinkles... but, lets get real here, not 100% of them like an iron will do.  So you pick and choose what to use it on.  Also, it is nearly always ready, assuming you have it in a place where its ready to use.Another reviewer struggled to get wrinkles out... I have a large board with fine carpet on the front, which you press the clothes against...without this, its much less effective.

"I am a huge Hunter Fan customer.... the company has always stood behind their products.... great support, and friendly customer service, a rarity in the good ol USA anymore.  I had one fan with a pull chord, no remote, so was glad to see this product come up on Vine.  Now I have a remote control, as well as a cell phone BT control.First, I am a super techie guy... I have wired homes,. installed way too many ceiling fans and know electricity very well.  So as others have pointed your, your mileage may vary based on your expertise.  Installation was a breeze for me, instructions ultra clear as with most Hunter products.  Product worked on first try, no reason to call tech support.  As an added remote, its superb...but I wonder how many fans don't come with remote controls these days?  Not sure what market this product is targeted after.  Next, the BT control with the cell phone... worked first try, flawless... but, will I ever use it?  Prob. not... again, maybe there is some specific uses for this that I am not aware of... maybe just a couch potatoe who always has cell phone in hand?  Regardless, its a neat gadget, that alone makes it worth its while... overall, a great product for the right application.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R44RJLTBP9SJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQOP2JO#wasThisHelpful","R44RJLTBP9SJV","A3OEIPLU13BEW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OEIPLU13BEW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I found The Man in the Empty Suit by Sean Ferrell, I was surprised that the book isn't longer than it is.  My ebook version is a mere 225 pages. Having said that, after reading the book, I can say that it is long enough.The idea behind the story, a time traveler returns to the 100th anniversary of his birth each year to celebrate his birthday with other both younger and older versions of himself is, in itself, quite grabbing.  As others have pointed out, this creates several difficulties dealing with a time paradox.  If this weren't enough, the murder of one of the versions of the protagonist drives the action for the rest of the book and creates a paradox in it's own right.The Man in the Empty Suit has enough atmosphere to keep a 1940's black and white film noire movie fan happy for a long time.  Most of the action takes place in a rather run down hotel that becomes another character entirely.  Combine this with a wonderful cast of characters, and the book is a reading party unto itself.One of the touches I liked in Sean Ferrell's story is the way the various versions of the main character interact.  The Suit, the version at the center of the story, refers to other versions of himself as The Nose, The Screwdriver, Seventy, etc.  There isn't any level of affection between the versions either.  In fact, the reader gets the feeling that the versions really don't like each other even though there is only a few years between them in some cases.One of the distractions for me was the endless, and really pointless, chase between The Suit and the juvenile versions of himself.  What was the point?The setting of the annual party is in a crumbling hotel which provides the atmosphere.  The hotel, in post apocalyptic New York City is an additional factor which, again adds to that atmosphere.Though I enjoyed The Man in the Empty Suit, I just can't award more than four stars.  I thought the story, as written, it too long.  I had difficulty in getting through the central part of the story.  I was disappointed that some of the questions the reader is left with are never answered which adds to the level of dissatisfaction the reader is left with.Still, The Man in the Empty Suit is a worthwhile read.  A beach read.Peace to all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8MOQ5UC28XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616951257#wasThisHelpful","R2K8MOQ5UC28XO","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nothing Gold Can Stay by Ron Rash is another gripping collection of short stories.  The short story is Rash' preferred format and I think it is where he shines the most.  Having said that I enjoy the poetry as well as his novels.Of the fourteen stories included in Nothing Gold Can Stay, ten have appeared before in various publications.  The New Yorker, Shade, The Warwick Review, and Ecotone are among the periodicals where these stories have appeared.While all of these stories have power and the ability to grip your imagination, several were especially defining for me.  I acknowledge that other readers will be touched by different stories and this reflects the literary DNA we bring to the experience. ""Those Who are Dead Are Only Now Forgiven"" was especially memorable because it looks at how hope can turn to hopelessness before we even realize it has happened and how those we choose to love can direct our chosen path.Also worthy of special mention is The Trusty.  The way we interact with those who appear to be nave can often have surprising results even though that isn't obvious at first.....or even at the end.As I said, all of the stories are wonderful but these spoke most loudly to me.By his own admission, Ron Rash is a poet first, and novelist second.  That is evident on virtually every page he has published and is no less obvious in Nothing Gold Can Stay.  The best time was always right before dusk.  The water got quieter, more still, especially the deep pools.  Sometimes there'd be a mayfly hatch, and it looked like pebbles hitting the surface.  It was the trout feeding, but they wouldn't make splashes, just those tiny sips, as if they didn't want to break the stillness.  Donnie and me would break down our rods, knowing a spinner wouldn't work with a hatch going.  But we didn't go right home.  We'd sit on the bank a few minutes.  Donnie might smoke a cigarette but otherwise neither....  Nothing Gold Can Stay, p36Or,  The cow's abdomen relaxed and the round eyes calmed.  Somewhere in the loft a swallow stirred.  Then the barn was silent and the lantern's light seemed to soften.  The calf waited in its deeper darkness for Carson to birth it whole and alive or dead and in pieces.  Carson's hands suddenly felt heavy, shackled. He looked down at them, the liver spots and dark blue veins, knuckles puffy with arthritis.  He remembered another misaligned calf, not nearly as bad as this one.  He was just months into his practice and had torn the cow's uterine wall, killing both cow and calf.  Doris had been pregnant with their first child, and when she'd asked Carson if the calf and the cow were okay, Carson had lied.  Three A.M. and the Stars Were Out, p233Nothing Gold Can Stay is a pretty fast read, and a re-reading gives time feel the stories.  Ron Rash often tells dark stories that reflect the reality that is Appalachia.Still, there is hope in the place and in the people and in the story.I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA99B3CE5ASRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062202715#wasThisHelpful","RA99B3CE5ASRD","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"19 Lessons on Tea:  A Guide by 27 Press is an impressive and very informative book.As a committed coffee drinker, I have long been tempted to explore the other side of the domestic non-alcoholic beverage world.  Unfortunately, my familiarity with tea is limited to the ""bag"" realm and the wonderful stuff served iced in the restaurants.Lessons are chapters.  At 95 just pages, plus space for notes on new tea sampling, 19 Lessons won't take much space on your bookshelf.  However, if this fact leads you to believe that this is a quick read you are mistaken.  I found myself flipping back to earlier lessons as I progressed through the book.  Add to this the fact that in many ways, 19 Lessons, is a reference book; a volume that you will want to refer to many times. Beside the lessons on tea types, I thought the most interesting Lesson (chapter) was number 15, Regions and Rituals.Lessons on Yellow Tea, Green Tea, White Tea, Oolong Tea, Black Tea are obviously needed.  But also included is a chapter on Iced Tea, Teapots, and Buying Tea.Tea is becoming an increasingly more popular drink.  19 Lessons is a great book if you're interested in gaining important information in this area, and doing so in a quick and efficient manner.I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2QZSDYE2YB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988770504#wasThisHelpful","R2N2QZSDYE2YB4","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead is an interesting read.  Had I seen this short novel in a bookstore, the title and the cover art might have dissuaded me from even picking up the book let alone reading it.  However, I did read it, and I have to admit that it was an interesting read with a somewhat surprising read.The book's action takes place in Savannah, Georgia with a significant detour to Paris, France.  Gordonston is a mid to upper class neighborhood that serves as a bedroom community for Savannah.  Most of the primary characters are of retirement age but the community they live in does have younger families.  We know this because of the Girl Scout cabin in the center of the neighborhood park and the play area referred to a number of times.Cindy, Carla, Heidi, and Thelma are the dog-walking club.  Thelma we never really meet since she has an advanced case of cancer and is never a part of the story.  It is the interplay of these three older women that drives most of the story.  Tom and Kelly, a young couple that are relatively newly married and Doug and Veronica, also, a young couple, add to the set of characters.  Elliot, Thelma's husband, and Mr. Jackson, round out the cast.  Whitehead has a talent of developing interesting characters.  The entire novel is only 189 pages (my copy) and in that short space he has developed nine fully developed characters.As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a word for word repeat of an early chapter near the end of the story.  I'm not sure the reason this was allowed to happen.  I have seen movies that replay an early scene at the climax of the movie, which is what Whitehead has apparently done.  While effective in a movie realm, it only mystifies the reader and, at least in this case, caused a slight episode of frustration.I also found the novel very wordy in places.  It's apparent that additional editing would have helped the story along.  Again, at only 189 pages, there are many places that the story could have been effectively expanded had page count been a consideration.I suspect that we will see additional novels based in Gordonston.  This prediction is made because so many tidbits regarding the characters were introduced and then just left out on the floor.  Just a random thought!Given these two negative issues, I still consider that a worthwhile read.I recommend Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, a pretty good beach read.( I was provided a free copy of this book but in no way influenced this review)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1034Z25AU8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1457514508#wasThisHelpful","RA1034Z25AU8W","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a committed, albeit, minor book collector, I found A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books by Nicholas A. Basbanes to be a profoundly eye opening read.  I've always known that book collecting existed in a world of it's own, but I never dreamed of the passion driving most collectors.Additionally, it has come as a surprise that the passion for book collecting has existed as long as it has.  Having been collecting books since my Marine Corps days, I thought my feeling toward my books was unique.  However, I have learned that many others have loved their collections as well.  For example, Silvestre de Sacy, who said ""Oh my darling books.""  ""A day will come when you will be laid out on the salesroom table, and others buy and possess you....""  It finally hit me that one day, someone else will own my signed and unsigned first editions of current literature.  My signed copy of The Reivers will be owned; possessed by another.  It was at this instant that I made a connection with the story (ies) that Basbanes had to tell.Virtually every named collector that Basbanes includes is new to me.  I am a babe in the woods in the world of book collecting, but therein lies the value of reading A Gentle Madness.  This book opened a completely new world to be, one that I somehow knew existed, but had no idea of the history of book collecting or the extent that collectors will go to build a collection.Basbanes does a marvelous job of illustrating the passion (s) that the collectors he includes in A Gentle Madness had for their avocation.  Whether it was personally perusing the book fares or Paris, or sending agents to the four corners of the planet to make purchases on their behalf, one is given a private glimpse into the mind of a bibliophile.  Well done Mr. Basbanes.Given the rise of the ebook, A Gentle Madness is a quietly re-assuring message that the physical book will continue to exist, even if it is only in private collections.  When you think about it, how big a deal will it be to collect an ebook?  How can you ask an author to sign an ebook?  Collections (libraries) of ""books"" will always be there.Finally, a private observation!  One of the great treasures of holding an antique book, collectible or not, is finding margin notes that some long past reader took time to put down.  Their reaction to the author, positive or negative, is a bonus to reading the book.  I'm not sure that's possible with ebooks.I highly recommend A Gentle Madness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RFY8S53NV2JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979949157#wasThisHelpful","R2RFY8S53NV2JR","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keeper of the Dawn, a wonderful debut novel by J. B. Hickman is a sensitive story and somewhat of a ""coming of age"" foray into the life of Jacob Hawthorne.  Reading debut novels is always a treat but sometimes filled with disappointment.  Nothing could be further from the truth with Keeper of the Dawn.Haling from a dysfunctional family, Jacob is sent to Wellington Academy located on a small island off the coast of Rhode Island.  Jacob eventually sees that he is with other boys from families headed by fathers of stellar success but also lacking the bonds of family.  Both of Jacob's parents are pre-occupied with their lives.  His older brother has fled the family for the four winds.  In an interview, Hickman said that Keeper of the Dawn was a novel of denial and so it is, profoundly.Part of the beauty of Keeper of the Dawn is the wonderful characters that populate the story landscape.  Perhaps the strongest attachment that Jacob makes in the story is that with his grandfather.  Other characters, Sal, for example, and several of Jacob's teachers are also memorable.One additional comment about Hickman's style.  Very few authors have the ability to use prose in such a magical way.  Mr. Hickman, through his use of language transports the reader into the story.  Wonderful!I truly enjoyed this novel and can recommend it without reservation.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQAWWY86MRD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983582904#wasThisHelpful","R3KQAWWY86MRD3","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years I've read perhaps a hundred books dealing with World War II, most I will admit have had to do with war at sea.  I can honestly state that I'd never heard of the incident between American 2nd Lt. Charles Brown and German 2nd Lt. Franz Stigler over the skies of Germany on one fateful day.  I'm not sure I would have believed it.  But, I've read the book and the story is true.A Higher Call by Adam Makos and Larry Alexander is perhaps the greatest book about WWII that I've read and that's going some.  A Higher Call is an emotional taffy machine.  It will influence your attitude about the German combatants that faced the allied soldiers.  Instead of all being the monsters we've learned to hate over the years, A High Call provides us with an intimate glimpse into the German ranks, admittedly on a limited basis.If you chose to read A Higher Call, hold on.  Use the chapter breaks to catch your breath.I highly recommend.Semper Fi.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EAPOF80ZPEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425252868#wasThisHelpful","R2EAPOF80ZPEO","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michelangelo's Last Painting: Its Chilling Revelation by Andrew Boemi is a pleasant surprise.  So many of these arty/suspenseful novels are over written and yes, over acted by the participants in the story and barely pass the Dan Brown smell test.  While Boemi's novel is a bit top heavy, it is a page-turner with an original take on Michelangelo and his work.  As I read the book I was hooked early.  I have a busy life and cannot read all the time.  When I was forced to put the book down I have to admit that I couldn't wait to get back to reading.  Only the fact that I had grandchildren visit for a week kept me from knocking out Michelangelo's Last Painting in near record time.The plot is grabbing even in its simplicity.  A painting of Christ on the Cross is created for Vittoria Colanna, Michelangelo's love interest.  However, certain elements of both the charcoal sketch and the actual oil painting are up setting to Colanna and are smudged out.  However, one of Michelangelo's assistants fails to follow instructions after the master's death and merely covers the painting with another art work.Spring forward 400 years and the original artwork is rediscovered and immediately develops a following among powerful interests who desire to possess the painting.  The world by the time this all takes place is a much different and more sinister place.  Technology has progressed to the point that wondrous military equipment is possible.  The geopolitical environment of Boemi's world is very scary with the distribution of power to rogue nations, city-states, and powerful individuals making for a very dangerous world.All this makes for a novel that is paced almost to the point that the reader is left breathless after just a few pages.  I can't remember any ""dead spots"" in the novel, which is surprising.Boemi has much to say in chapter 20 that is very insightful of our present predicament with both the economic and political environment in the United States.  I think he has a handle on what's going on in Washington today but this is not a distraction from the story; merely and explanation as to how the world in the novel came to be.  This is scary because it is plausible.If you're looking for a wonderful read I highly recommend Michelangelo's Last Painting.(I was provided an uncorrected proof by the publisher but this review is entirely my view point and is not influenced by anyone.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XIDP8RTSLN2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988322919#wasThisHelpful","R2XIDP8RTSLN2Y","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Wind Through the Keyhole: A Dark Tower Story is Stephen King's latest addition to his Dark Tower opus.  It actually takes place between Dark Tower, Book 4, ""The Wizard and Glass"" and Dark Tower, Book 5 ""The Wolves of Calla"".Roland and his ka-tet are caught by a sudden winter storm while on the way to the Outer Baronies.  It is during this layover that Roland tells his cohort three tales.  The tales fit together nicely and the reader is (especially if you're a Dark Tower fan) treated to some of Roland's past.  First young Roland is sent to a small mining town to hunt down a shape shifter who has been terrorizing the community.  It is during this part of the tale that Roland comes across Bill Streeter, a young boy who is the sole survivor of the ""skin-man's"" latest killings.  In an effort to ease young Bill's mind Roland begins telling a story from the Magic Tales of Eld.  We are introduced to Tim Stoutheart's story.  When the tales are over Roland ka-tet, all of them are still there and we know they're bound for the adventures in the Wolves of Calla.Like another reviewer, the best thing about The Wind Through the Keyhole is that King does not change anything.  Stephen King is not averse to changing, expanding, or rewriting his stories as evidenced by the reissue of The Stand.  I for one would never tell Stephen King, of all people, how to handle his storytelling and to be honest I thought the expanded version of The Stand was better than the original issue.  Still, when I saw the announcement of The Wind Through the Keyhole I did get a bit nervous since I like the series the way it is.The Dark Tower series now stand a eight novels.  Beyond these, many of King's other novels touch on the series either directly or tangentially.  In any case, King is a master storyteller.  Like so many other great writers, it may be the next generation of professors and literary agents that finally recognize the fact.The Wind Through The Keyhole is a must read if you're a King fan.I highly recommend.Peace always.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MEHBAEJNC3HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451658907#wasThisHelpful","R3MEHBAEJNC3HK","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lincoln Child's latest book, The Third Gate, is a terrific read and filled with enough suspense, mystery, and drama to compete with the best of the 1940's film noire movies.  In fact, the book felt like an old black and white movie.  Mixing hard science, history, archaeology, and the occult The Third Gate is a page turner and sure to please a wide audience.The story largely takes place in the Sudd, a swampy area of the upper Nile at a research facility looking for the grave of Egypt's first pharaoh.  Jeremy Logan, a history professor, is recruited by the expedition's organizer and underwriter, Porter Stone.  However, Logan's training as a historian is not the expertise Stone is after.  In fact, Logan is what he terms an ""enigmalogist"".  Logan studies paranormal events and near death experiences (NDE).  Why is this particular specialty needed on an archaeological expedition in the middle of a swamp in the middle of the desert?  Well, that's why you might want to read the book.I would love to give The Third Gate five stars.  However, there are places where the story wears a little thin and some revelations are ""telegraphed"" in advance.  I would love to share them, but then this review would be a spoiler for you.  Still, there are enough twists and turns to keep you reading.  Certainly the story proper is lean and streamlined with no fluff.  Child is recognized as a writer who turns out tightly written stories and The Third Gate is no exception.Despite the one thin spot, The Third Gate is a very worthwhile read.  I finished the last hundred pages in a single sitting and couldn't put the book down until I'd finished.I highly recommend The Third Gate.Peace!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5W8O81QMXR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531389#wasThisHelpful","R1E5W8O81QMXR6","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to give Winston Groom top marks for his book Shiloh, 1862.  While much has been written on all of the major battles of the Civil War, there always seems to be something new to say.  I believe that in most cases, new books covering these battles stem from an author who feels they have something to add to the literature.  It could also be that an author feels it is simply time to get the study of a battle in front of a new audience and rather than republishing an older, updated work, its just easier to write a new account.  Whatever the reason, I enjoy these works as they are published.  In this case, Winston Groom, an experienced Civil War author, does a great job with the first bloody battle of that conflict.Some authors have a knack at brevity in the books they publish.  Frankly, I prefer an author who is willing to fully explore the backgrounds of the major players and decision makers in a given study.  In this case, Groom provides a decent exploration of all of the major leaders involved in the Shiloh battle.  Better yet, I like that he took the time to provide updates on those he mentioned by name as he told the story, both general and private, both northern and southern.  That was an especially nice addition.Also, the maps covering the battle are first rate as are the notes included at the end of each chapter.Winston Groom loves the English language and proves it on each page of the book.  As one reads the book, it is easy to see the great amount of research under taken in preparation for the writing of Shiloh, 1862.  The many colorful details provided for the reader that adds so much detail, texture, and color had to be mined by countless hours reading letters, diaries, and official reports of the participants.  While some may feel that much of this information is of little importance and may even detract for the book, I feel that these details help clear the window and provide as realistic picture as possible.Well written and intended for a general audience, I highly recommend.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21RXTOJ5CBWEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142620874X#wasThisHelpful","R21RXTOJ5CBWEZ","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Complete Peanuts, 1983-1984 (Vol. 17) is another installment on what will be the complete republication of all of the Peanuts comic panels.  On the one hand it seems hard to believe we're already to volume 17 and yet there seems so much more to go.The 1983-1984 edition continues some of the more established storylines.  Snoopy and his World War I flying ace, Charlie Browns continuing search of a Valentines card, Lucy's love affair Schroeder, Snoopy's brother Spike's adventures in the desert, as well as the Great Pumpkin and more are included.  Also, some interesting new elements.  Peppermint Patti's dismal progress in school results in failure to be promoted in school.  During the summer she tour's Europe with her father.  Spike's infatuation with a girl in a red pickup truck is also launched in this volume.I did notice that Charlie Brown avoids Lucy's trick of pulling the football away at the last minute which shows some real growth for this character.For confirmed Peanuts fans there is much here to read and cherish.  Again, I found myself thinking back to memories for these two years.  In this case, the birth of my youngest daughter on July 18, 1983 as I read the panel for that day.  Other memories surfaced as well.I highly recommend The Complete Peanuts, 1983-1984.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WOP9WNH0U7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606995235#wasThisHelpful","R13WOP9WNH0U7V","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure that like many Americans, I was completely unaware of Madeleine Albright's background.  When she was selected to be Secretary of State by Bill Clinton, I just assumed (you know what that can do) that she was another sheltered and pampered intellectual; another product of an Ivey League education.  Well, it just goes to show you that one should never take at face value what one sees.Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance and War, 1937-1948 by Ms Albright opens the curtain on a historical event that is a lesson on appeasement.  Of course, the betrayal of Czechoslovakia is not new information.  Those of us that remember our second or third semester of Western Civilization have had this tale told to us.  However, reading Ms Albrights book places it on a very personal level and we are also provided with details that most of us were unaware of.  We are intimately shown what betrayal of this small central European country meant and it's cost to those who had to live under the events that were triggered by the actions of the western democracies, mainly France and Britain.Prague Winter is not an autobiography.  Albright's life is secondary to the history that she tells.  While she does tell us about herself growing up and how the various moves that her father, Josef's work required impacted on her, the main part of the book is reserved for what happened on the world stage.  Diplomacy and failed diplomacy.  Promises and the promises turned to lies.  Action and inaction.  The old saying that ""the road to h___ is paved with good intentions"" would serve as a good synopsis of Prague Winter.But the biggest lesson of Prague Winter isn't a new one.  Appeasement, whatever it is called simply doesn't work with mad men.  Dictators, as did Hitler, see the intention of others to avoid war as weakness.  Albright reveals several times that had Hitler thought the western democracies would have fought him over Czechoslovakia and then Poland, that he probably would not have proceeded with his plans.  We can only guess what would have happened but World War II might have been avoided with all of the tragedy, suffering, and death.Prague Winter is a gripping read.  Though the reader probably knows the outcome of the major events discussed, there is a power that draws the finger to turn the page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W59VWKNILQ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062030310#wasThisHelpful","R3W59VWKNILQ4S","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always a pleasure to have the chance to read and ponder and then review a writer's debut novel.  There is only one first of anything.  Wiley Cash has written a sensitive, troubled, yet spiritual story set in the western mountains of North Carolina; Madison County specifically.A Land More Kind Than Home is an interesting title and accurately reflects the story and the characters held within its pages.  The story turns around three main characters.  Adelaide Lyle, an elderly single woman who narrates several key chapters and provides most of the back-story. Jess Hall, age 9, the central character who is a young boy growing up in Madison County along with his older brother Stump and his mother and father.  Clem Barefield, the county sheriff is central in several chapters and also provides some background as the story progresses.We are told that Stump, Jess' brother, is deaf and dumb.  It may be that he is autistic and though a minor point, would impact the story.  At any rate, Stump and Jess witness an event that begins to impact everyone's life and eventually spins out of control.  It is this singular happening that then triggers the most tragic part of the story.  It is interesting how Cash layers his story.  Each layer is interesting in and of itself, but then as more of the story is revealed you realize that what you read earlier is more interesting.  I hope that's not confusing.The reader is also treated to a glimpse into backwoods religion that includes speaking in tongues, and handling snakes.There are a host of other interesting characters that fill provide contour for the novel.  Jess' father and mother, Ben and Julie are also central to and play a significant role during the last two thirds of the book.  Carson Chambliss!  It is dangerous to say too much about him without throwing spoilers all over the floor.  Suffice it to say that Carson will live in your memory for a long time and is the poster child for what is wrong with organized religion.Full of wonderful description and introducing characters that are three dimensional and fully developed, A Land More Kind than Home is destined to make Wiley Cash' name familiar to many readers.I highly recommend A Land More Kind than Home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEMZI9PZHUTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062088149#wasThisHelpful","RNEMZI9PZHUTM","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Boyd is a prolific writer.  His latest novel, Waiting for Sunrise, is a journey in the months just before World War I and the early years of the conflict.  The primary protagonist is Lysander Rief, an actor in the flower of his twenties.  The story opens with Lysander in Vienna seeking psychiatric treatment for a condition that is of some embarrassment to him.While in Vienna, Lysander meets a young artist named Hettie Bull and begins an affair.  In the end she becomes pregnant and in an effort to cover her betrayal of her full time lover, claims that Lysander raped her.  This forces Lysander to make his escape from Vienna with the help members of the British consulate.His escape puts him in debt to the British government, both figuratively and literally.  As a way to repay the debt, Lysander agrees to perform a mission behind what are now enemy lines.  It is through this experience that his life changes.  In fact, he discovers that he has the ability to be quite brutal in accomplishing his mission.  Once he completes this initial foray into the world of spies, it becomes easy for him to continue since he is able to bring to bear his talent as an actor.Waiting for Sunrise is a suspenseful story.  This first half of the book is tedious in places and moves rather slowly.  However, it is the first half that really sets up the suspense of the last half and allows Boyd to create the intense atmosphere that he is so good at.Waiting for Sunrise is an excellent period piece full of interesting characters and a clear eyed look at an earlier time; a time that proves that life then isn't as innocent as we think.I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQCWYL8H2885/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061876763#wasThisHelpful","R2WQCWYL8H2885","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Ben Carson's America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made this Country Great is perhaps one of the most significant books published in many years.  It is certainly the most profound book I've read this year.Dr. Ben Carson grew up in poverty.  His mother realized that the path out of poverty required a love of reading.  She required her son to read a book per week and write a book report and hand to her.  It took a few years, but eventually he discovered that his mother was illiterate and unable to read the book reports.  Still, she instilled upon him a love of reading that did lead him to a better life.Dr. Carson, as a black youth, experienced racial hatred and discrimination first hand.  He reacted as anyone would; with anger and aggression.  One incident he relates is attempting to use a knife on another youth.  Lunging at the boy, the knife hit his belt buckle and snapped.  Had the belt buckle not deflected and break the knifeblade, he might have killed the boy changing Ben's life forever a robbing us of a very talented surgeon.Dr. Carson realizes that the path to success lies in getting a good education.  The founding fathers also believed that the nation's health rested with an educated electorate.  He asked the question ""what are we becoming"" as we get away from our basic values; reliance of education is one of those values.Dr. Carson also believes, rightly, that physicians should be more involved with their communities in leadership roles.  He points out that four of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were physicians.Most who read the book will know that Dr. Carson is a neurosurgeon and tops in his field.  He is an excellent example of what it means to be successful today for all Americans, not just black Americans.America the Beautiful is a valuable read in a nation that seems to have lost itself.I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WN1D9087TC9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310330718#wasThisHelpful","R1WN1D9087TC9Z","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not trained as a poet but I know good poetry when I read (hear it in the ear of the mind) and Robert Morgan's new volume of poems Terroir is a good collection.  By the way, not being trained in French, Mr. Morgan says that Terroir means Dirt in the French tongue.There are 78 poems in this collection and virtually all of them relate to home, country, family, and nature.  Morgan is a truly talented novelist and historian, but he is a poet first.  You can hear his love of language not only in his poetry but also in his fiction.  I find that writers who are poets first are much better writers in their ability to use language in a playful manner than those who are not.All of these poems are worthwhile but I have a few that are my favorites.  Snakes in the Attic, pg. 81, (having had that situation before) seems to touch me most directly.  Also, Flag on the Barn, pg. 90, speaks to love of country, family, and place.  Confederate Graves at Elmira deals with the tragedy that prisoners of the Union Army suffered and one lone black custodian  ""who dedicated twenty years  to finding out the name for each  Confederate grave and then had etched  the proper words on fields of stones,  to honor those lost far from home,  because it was the decent thing,  he answered neighbors' questioning.I recommend all these poems highly, but my most favorite of all is The Years Ahead, pg. 57.I highly recommend Terroir by Robert Morgan.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R324Z0CY0D0QZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143120190#wasThisHelpful","R324Z0CY0D0QZF","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a man in his early 60's I have no problem identifying with Tony Webster the main character in Julian Barnes' The Sense of an Ending.  Given that the book is nominated for the Man Booker is enough said.  Even given the book's shortness, the story is captivating and worth reading.The first part of The Sense of an Ending deals with Tony Webster's formative years.  While some feel this isn't the strongest part of the book it is never the less, an important part because it sets up the last part of the book.  As another reviewer pointed out, the book is more character driven than plot driven though the plot is a strong one.In many ways The Sense of an Ending is a book about remembering; something that is becoming more important to me.  I identify with Tony Webster on so many levels.I recommend.Peace to all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5X6H0QEA3PB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307957128#wasThisHelpful","RY5X6H0QEA3PB","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Morgan is one of the premier authors writing today in the South.  Though many of his books have been fiction and poetry, his last two ventures, Boone, and his current release, Lions of the West: Heroes and Villains of the Westward Expansion are explorations into American history.  Boone dealt exclusively with the life of Daniel Boone, his place and times and that work was well received nationally.  Lions of the West, on the other hand looks at the lives of ten prominent Americans and their contributions to the American story and the settling of the west.  When I say prominent, I mean Americans who have contributed significantly to our development and success.  And, as the subtitle states, some of these people may have been villains, and others heroes and some have been both.  I guess each will have their own opinions.I believe that Morgan portrays these Americans in chronological order so Jefferson is the first personality that is explored.  Then follows Andrew Jackson, John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed), David Crocket, Sam Houston, James K. Polk, Winfield Scott, Kit Carson, Nicholas Trist, and finally John Quincy Adams.  The longest chapter is devoted to Winfield Scott and the shortest to John Chapman.  Which is the most interesting?  Again, everyone will have their own ideas.One of the joys of books of this type are the tid-bits of knowledge picked up by reading the chapters.  I'm always amazed when reading a book of history how the author develops the story he is going to tell.  Sometimes, as an author spins his tale I wonder why this information or that information was included.  In almost all cases, by reading on, all becomes clear.  Morgan also lets his tale of each person wander, but never does he include needless information. You might be wondering why James K. Polk was included in this group.  Most Americans couldn't tell you two things about Mr. Polk, one of the lesser known Presidents.  Morgan points out that Polk is the only President that did everything he said he would.  He promised he'd serve one term and he did.  He is the President that gained for the United States Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, etc.  He gained for his country nearly the land area purchased by Mr. Jefferson.  And among historians everywhere regarded as one of our most successful Presidents. Then there is Sam Houston as another example.  Houston was anything but a good guy during this youth.  He was a drunkard, and a scraper, an fought more than he share of duels, winning most of them.  It was only after his move to Texas that the statesman and military leader that we're familiar with surfaced.  Read the book and you'll see why each man was included.One thought is that, as Morgan shows, some of these men have been both heroes and villains.  In many ways they reflect there country.  The United States, over its short history has proven that it has the capacity to do extraordinary good and has also filled the role of villain.I had an opportunity to have lunch with Robert Morgan and several others after he delivered a program on Daniel Boone at my library.  He mentioned then that as a result of the research for Boone that he had gained an appreciation on the settlement of the West.  It is pretty evident that Morgan likes doing the research for his books.Robert Morgan is a tremendous author.  I've enjoyed his fiction for years and became a stronger fan after reading Boone.  That appreciation has grown even stronger after finishing Lions of the West.I highly recommend.Peace always.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB5MLKXSN2IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565126262#wasThisHelpful","R1DB5MLKXSN2IB","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Waking, Ron Rash's first collection of poetry in ten years, is a unique collection of works.  Some of the poems relate to the Civil War (Shilo, Cold Mountain, The Belt).  Others spring from or relate to novels Rash has written.  Girl in the River (Saints at the River), and Good Friday, 2006: Shelton Laurel (The World Made Straight).  There may be other poems that relate to his other two novels, One Foot in Eden, or Serena, but I haven't made the connection.Rash is a fluid novelist, and his poetry is even more lyrical, the rhymes subtle, and the word play surprising sometimes.  He richly reflects the traditions of Applachia and gives voice to the people who have populated the region for generations.  The poem ""Tobacco"", for example, demonstrates the farmer's struggle to make a decent living and the tragedy of pursuing that cash crop.  ""Dismal"" explores the heartbreak of farming in the mountains: ""though fog was worst, / how it settled / for days to snuff out light and sound, / rot barbed wire, fence posts and grain. / No gaze but inward in a world / gray and still as any gravestone.""Waking contains 74 poems, most not longer than a page and many much shorter.Ron Rash is a significant author and poet who has found his voice.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R135ZGA44657UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1891885820#wasThisHelpful","R135ZGA44657UR","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Luce is content to live her life as she now has it.  She's a caretaker for an out of business bed and breakfast whose better days have come and gone.  Luce is happy to live in isolation, socially as desolate as she can get.  So attracted to the hermits creed is Luce that she has burned the boat that could take to town across the lake in just under half an hour.  By road that closest town is an hour away.  No matter, Luce is happy.  But this happy existence is doomed.So opens Charles Frazier's third novel Nightwoods.  Nightwoods is different in several ways from his previous novels:  Cold Mountain and then Thirteen Moons.  First, Nightwoods is set in the 20th Century.  More fundamentally, however, the current book is pared down and less affected by history.  The Civil War was the background for Cold Mountain and the removal of the Cherokee from the Southern Appalachians was the core event in Thirteen Moons.  Nightwoods is historically isolated in that respect, but that's okay.  Nightwoods does fine in its time and place.Luce's existence is set on it's ear when she learns that she must raise her sisters twins.  The social worker merely shows up and that is, as they say, that.  One boy and one girl!  However, these children aren't the cute and cuddly type.  These children are ruined, almost feral.  They're neither interested in talking or interacting in any other way for that matter. They even avoid eye contact.  That Luce must care for these children is even more interesting when we learn that she doesn't even like children.The state shrink thinks they're weird.  I mean, they make roosters disappear, set the house on fire and generally zone out.Then there is Bud, a backward thug who is convinced the twins know where money is located.  Luce has suspicions of her own regarding Bud but to say more might be a spoiler.Frazier has created a very interesting character in Luce but then Frazier is great in this regard.  Can anyone deny that Ruby is the most memorable character from Cold Mountain.Nightwoods might be the best book of the year for but, but there is still three months left.I highly recommend.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2491UERJHGHP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006709X#wasThisHelpful","R2491UERJHGHP7","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matthew Pearl gives his readers another well constructed and well written story in The Technologists.  Centered in Boston in the post Civil War years, the story revolves around a group of MIT students trying to solve several technological disasters that have befallen the city.Pearl does a good job inter-weaving the real and the fictional in constructing his story.  For example, Professor Louis Agassiz was a real figure that did in fact teach at Harvard.  Whether he is accurately portrayed in the Technologists I can't say.  However, a quick Internet search will reveal all.  Pearl also did an enormous amount of research because he has seemingly nailed the depiction of the time period in which his story takes place.  Even the dialog of the characters rings true.  Many of you know that the Dicksonian period was extremely harsh in the social norms that were imposed on everyone.  Pearl deals with the period by including the lone woman student, Ellen Swallow, who must study in absolute isolation from her male counterparts.  Harsh even in fiction!Marcus Mansfield, is a student in the first class at the fledgling Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Marcus is a Civil War veteran, a former prisoner of war, and a charity student.  While he comes from a humble background, Marcus is a sharp student in the sciences.  It is he and several of his classmates that decide to investigate the recent occurrences both in Boston Harbor and later the business district of the city.  We take for granted the gifts (or curses depending on one's point of view) of modern science and technology.  We forget that at an earlier time, technology and the science that bread the breakthroughs were viewed with mistrust as were those that practiced these ""arts.""  This feeling puts Marcus Mansfield and his cohorts at a distinct disadvantage which they must deal with.One of the things I like about some authors is when they refer to an earlier novel or short story in their most recent publication.  Stephen King does this routinely as do many others.  Pearl briefly refers to the Dante Club in The Technologists.  I don't know why I like this trait in some authors but I do.Finally, the author creates an atmosphere in the story that is similar to the work of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Very effective!I wouldn't necessarily call The Technologist a page turner, but it is certainly an above average mystery story.  Matthew Pearl is a gifted author; one that I will read again.I highly recommend.Peace to all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HT0BGGH1QPZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400066573#wasThisHelpful","R3HT0BGGH1QPZE","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was fully grown when I discovered Shel Silverstein.  My oldest daughter brought home Where the Sidewalk Ends from her school library.  I don't think she opened the book, but I did, and I've been a huge fan since.  My youngest daughter is also a fan.  When she was about 9 she made a point of memorizing several of her favorite Silverstein poems.  It is this ability to reach some children that makes Shel Silverstein such a unique artist.  His passing was a true loss for the country as a whole, but for children specifically.I've purchased and read Every Thing On It and will be sharing this volume with my granddaughter when she visits.  I may even read a poem or two to my now fully grown daughters.  So what if nobody came?  I have all the ice cream and tea,  And I'll laugh with myself,  And I'll dance with myself,  And I'll sing ""Happy birthday to me!""Of course, when you read Silverstein's poems you experience the same lyrical wordplay that he is famous for.  These fresh poems continue his legacy of talking to children with respect and at the same time honoring their wonder at the world around them.I highly recommend Every Thing On It to children (of all ages) everywhere.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7RNH8LPXZ4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061998168#wasThisHelpful","R1V7RNH8LPXZ4Q","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something reassuring about the steady arrival of these collections of the Peanuts gang.  Honestly, as I've said in virtually every volume that I've reviewed (not all of them) each book is a trip down memory lane as I recall what I was doing when these panels appeared.The 1981-1982 volume continues with the same members but with the introduction of Marbles, another of Snoopy's siblings.  We also see Spike drafted into the Army (Snoopy's imaginary WWI experiences).  Charlie Brown plays for Peppermint Patti's baseball team and ends up blowing a fantastic lead.  Charlie Brown's family also gets into farming, etc., etc.If you're a fan of the Peanuts neighborhood then you'll grab this 16th volume.  If you've missed one of the best retrospective publishing efforts of all time, it might be time to get on board and enjoy a new tradition.I highly, highly recommend.Peace to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CV2CTG7BA7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606994719#wasThisHelpful","R30CV2CTG7BA7Y","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been some time since I picked up a Temperance Brennan (Kathy Reichs)novel.  In fact, Grave Secrets, was the last one I read completely.  Something in the description for Flash and Bones led me to pick it up and read it and I'm glad I did.  As with another reviewer, I am struck also by the difference in Temperance Brennan in the books and on the television.  I'm pretty sure I prefer the book character hands down.Its NASCAR time in Carolina as the Coca Cola 600 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway becomes the mecca of the moment for race fans everywhere.  But then a barrel filled with black goo turns up with a body in it.  Temperance is called in both to investigate and identify the body, a victim of an apparent homicide and also to clear the way for the race to proceed......pronto.Wayne Gamble, an employee of the race track suspects that the body is either that of his sister Cindi or her boyfriend Cale both of whom disappeared twelve years earlier.  It seems that Cale had connections to a right-wing extremist group.  The investigation into his and Cindi's disappearance was dropped by the local police as well as the FBI at the time the couple went missing.  Tempe isn't buying that theory, however.  She thinks the body is that of, Ted Raines, a recently disappeared employee of the Center for Disease Control.  The FBI is taking no chances and swings in and takes the body.Given the absence of a body and any other leads Temperance is stymied, but not for long.  Not only is the investigation not going well, but Tempe must deal with her ex-husband's  issues.It is an understatement to say that Kathy Reichs is a gifted author and has a sure fire franchise in Temperance Brennan.  Flash and Bones is a gripping, well written novel by a mature author practicing her craft.  Having said that, the novel is realistic and doesn't fall off the ""reality scale"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MX7N8QTBMSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439102414#wasThisHelpful","R14MX7N8QTBMSS","A23US54A0OILE4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23US54A0OILE4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using a whetstone to sharpen my blades.  It's a lot of work and takes some skill, but when done right, the result is a sharper blade than this sharpener. However, nobody else in my kitchen would even tough the whetstone, and a small mistake can damage the coating of my new set of Komachi knifes.The biggest difference is the angle.  Knifes that have been sharpened with whetstone tend to have a more acute angle and the edge is more like the tip of a heart shape than straight V shape.  I tried these knifes on this KitchenIQ sharpener and had to run through it 20 to 30 times to reshape the angle. I'm surprised to see a lot of metal metal shards falling out.  On the new Komachi knifes having the normal angle, it only took 4-5 times on each groove as instructed.The result is quite sharp, but I still miss the effortless feeling of a blade just sharpened with the whetstone where cutting everything feels like a hot knife through butter.

"It's not the filament that amazed me, but rather the lack of a bulky unsightly base.  Where is it?The base is for a circuit and a transformer . The transformer is needed because LED chips can't work with 120V AC.  It must be converted to something like 4.5V DC The transformer emits heat, so the base casing also acts as a heat sink.  The case must be big enough to cover up the transformer as well as dissipate heat.With the filament technology, it appears that they put a large number (25) low-powered LED chips in a series in each filament, reducing the requirement of converting the voltage.  One tear-down video shows a tiny transformer, while another tear down shows no transformer at all.  Without the the transformer, there's less heat and the base is gone.  There's is still a circuit, but they managed to squeeze it within the threaded section.What I like:+ no bulky base+ filament looks like incandescent+ light can shine down because there's no big base blocking it.  This is particularly important for chandeliers having the bulb standing up to mimic candles+ color is more true to incandescent.  It's slightly more yellow than other ""warm"" LED bulbs and has no nauseating green mixed in+ globe is glass, not clear plastic+ instant on, no hummWhat I don't like:+ increased cost+ unproven technology.  I wonder how long it would last.  The transformer is usually the first thing that burns out, not the LED chip, so it bodes well to have a smaller transformer. However, first generation manufacturing and common lack of QC in chinese factories could play a bigger role here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TTW71SNUO5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPQWPA0#wasThisHelpful","R16TTW71SNUO5T","AV3E6XNTB4RV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3E6XNTB4RV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The product is well built, but the ease of closing it depends on installation.  The two sides need to align perfectly.  This is more tricky than it seems because the sliding window might not be flushed with the frame bar.  In such case, add a shim to make it flush.  Alignment issue is the reason why phillips screws are included in addition to the one-way tamper resistant screws.  It might seem unnecessary to use the phillips screw first only to be removed and replaced with the one-way screws.  But don't skip this important step because once the one-way screws go in, you can't remove them to adjust the alignment.If you made mistake in drilling, or if you're replacing an existing lock and the old screw holes are not at the exact same location, you can easily cover up the old holes with Bamboo Skewer and wood glue.  Then a new hole near can be drilled right next the old one without breaking up the wood.  Drilling pilot holes is strongly recommended because it's so easy to crack near the edge.The way the key works is slightly strange.  There's no need to turn the key.

"Slim is in - I've had very cushy cases before, like the Ballistic case, but I really hate them now.  They are hard to pull out of jean pockets and teleported me back to the brick phone era. So now I prefer slim cases.The closest competitor for this Caseology is the Elago G5.  They are both slim and are nearly identical except:. The Elago is hard plastic, Caseology is flexible. When mounted on the phone, both of them feel hard. Hard plastic has better protection in case of a fall.. The Elago has no protection for the top and bottom of the phone.. The Elago is slimmer and exposes the aluminum rim around the Galaxy S3.  It makes the phone look prettier, albeit has slightly less protection for the screen.. The Elago hard plastic will eventually crack (after about 1 year). Both are glossy and slippery, which is good for slipping in jeans pocket, but hard to hand hold.No obvious winner here.Note that I'm using this Caseology on the Virgin Mobile version of the Samsung Galaxy S3.

"Why is this cheap?  Because it has no rechargeable battery inside.  The battery to support 40W power over hours would need to be huge. Just about any bluetooth speakers out there include a battery, so they have to use lower power amplifiers, resulting in tiny sound.  So if you have a place to plug in, then you'll get a lot more bang, or in this case thump, for your buck.Sound quality: flat + good by default or powerful + distorted when tweaked.  By default, the speaker generates high quality mid tone but lacks the high and low end.  If you don't need the thump then this would be your best setting.  When tweaked the settings, you can get a lot of bass and treble, but then distortion becomes a factor.  Increasing the volume makes distortion increasingly worse.  Regardless of settings you'll never get a solid kick or sparkling high like those of a quality car/home audio system (but that's an unfair comparison).  The settings include:. D-Bass. Base +1, +2, +3, +4. Treb +1, +2, +3, +4. Input Level +1, +2.

"The LED light is nice and bright, but the LED driver is dead after just a couple of weeks.  First it got dimmer then it only turned on intermittently.  I bought another LED driver and now the light works perfectly.A LED driver is basically a transformer that outputs a contant current while leaving the voltage to vary.  Voltage needs to adapt to LED temperature so that it has the same brightness when first turned on (cold) and after warmed up.For this 3 Watt light, look for an LED driver that says 3x1W or 1x3W.  It should output about 300mA current and let the voltage varry between 6-10V.  At the max, 10 Volt x 300 mA = 3,000 mW = 3 Watt.NEC code.  If you're planning to install this into the ceiling or wall, then you should know that it doesn't meet the code without extra work.  The hardwired connection to household 110V needs to be in an electrical box.  That's why if you buy a recessed light can in the US, there's always a junction box attached to it.  In China there's no such law, so they didn't make the box.I had to install a junction box right next to the light for this  purpose.  Also, the LED driver needs to be in accessible place for replacement, because it would eventually burn out.  I put the LED driver in the junction box.  There's no light can to contain the heat, albeit a very small amount, so at least make sure insulation material is at least 3"" from the back of the light.  Some cities also have the requirement that recessed ceiling lights need to be Air Tight for energy conservation, which this light is not.If you install it in a cabinet, then NEC code doesn't apply.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DY0HEI6MBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2ASPTG#wasThisHelpful","R10DY0HEI6MBT","AV3E6XNTB4RV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3E6XNTB4RV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the 50 ball version of the Gamma ball hopper, which worked so well.  When I needed more capability, I stuck with Gamma.  However, the larger size doesn't work as well as the small one, because sheer weight of 110 balls is too much for the metal wires.  These wires are thicker than the 50 ball version, but are not strong enough.  Common problems include: it collapses often when stood up, the lid opens by itself when I laid the hopper horizontally in my car's trunk, the legs slip out and had to be popped back in.So I used pliers to bend the metal wires where the lid and legs snap in.  I also used a metal file to rough up the slippery wire surface at contact points.

"After months of frustration with the Home Deepot fogger (from DIG Corp), I gave this a try.  The DIG Corp has a poorly designed mist head that either leaks or sprays only a tiny quirt instead of a fog.  It also fails often, because hard water eventually clogs up the tiny hole.In contrast, the hole on the Orbit is much bigger and thus harder to clog up.  It also sprays out farther and wider, like 3 feet long, so one sprayer can mist multiple hanging orchid baskets at once.  In windy condition, the wide mist coverage ensures some of the mist to touch the exposed orchid roots, rather than being blown away.  Of course, you can adjust the flow down all the way to a complete stop if you don't need a big spread. Turning it down will gradually make the mist thicker and more like a stream than a fog though.Tip: Unlike drippers, misters need a lot of water pressure.  While this mist sprayer connects to 1/4"" tube, the small tube diameter doesn't allow a lot of pressure to be carried over a long distance.  Keep the small tube short, like within a few feet.  Use the larger 1/2"" tube when you run more than 10 feet, and then connect the small tube to the big tube at the very end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TWEBBG5B1A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B8UXQ6#wasThisHelpful","R17TWEBBG5B1A2","AV3E6XNTB4RV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV3E6XNTB4RV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"True, foam will save money on soap, but that wasn't my main intension.  With foam, the soap easily spreads all over your hands, rather than just where you pour it on.  Foam is also quicker to rinse off than thick soap. This is espetially true for kids, who are too lazy to thoroughly clean their hands.  When one kid in class gets sick, they all get sick.I loved the disposable foam soap bottle that I bought previously, and that was why I looked for this dispenser.  Compared to the disposable bottle, the foam dispenser works nearly the same, but not quite as great:. The foam is a little runny. After a day or two, the first pump gives out very little foam.  I would have to pump it twice.I'm still giving it 5 stars because the problems are more likely the soap than the dispenser.  I'm diluting from a hand soap refill.  Maybe the formulated foam solution is better than mixing regular soap myself.  I'll also try giving it less water next time.I wish there are more styles to choose from.  The modern style of this dispenser doesn't quite match my traditional home.-------------Update on 9/7/2015The white plastic gets dirty after several months of usage, perhaps from greasy hands trying to pump.

"These are closed back headphones, which is expected for studio style -- helps keep outside noises out. That said, I found they didn't block external noises as much as other headphones I've tested. This may or may not be good for your situation; if you need to talk to others while wearing them, it's good, if you need absolute quiet in a noisy environment, it's bad.The cord length is nice and long; easily reaches to my recording device. Plus the coil at the bottom can be stretched out for an even greater distance. This is good because the audio cable is NOT removable/replaceable; it is permanently attached to the left ear-cup. I prefer to have the option to remove it, but in my case, I find it is a good length. Should you wish for a shorter cord, you are best looking elsewhere.The leather ear pads are comfortable. I found I could wear them for hours without feeling uncomfortable. The ear cups didn't get in the way when wearing glasses -- never once did the headphones press the earpieces into my skin. They fit snugly without adding excess pressure against the skull.What impressed me most with these headphones is the sound quality. The bass is rich and thick and the high notes are clear and crisp. I've tested a lot of headphones, and these stand out toward the top on sound quality. Impressive considering the low price range.Overall, these are nice studio headphones. I use them in my home studio for doing voice-over acting and they fit the bill well.

"I am impressed with the quality of this watch. The build is very solid and sturdy. The negative of this is that the watch is very heavy. The metal band doesn't help with the weight. If you have thinner wrists like me, you can take some of the links out to lighten it a bit, but I still found it takes a while to get used to the weight. Speaking of thin wrists, I was impressed that the watch face fit me so well. Typically, with larger watches, they stick out and look silly on me. But this one forms really nicely.As far as style, this watch has an executive feel. More for suit and tie than blue-collar workers or outdoor enthusiasts. Great for me since I've been going on job interviews in the business industry; makes me look more valuable.If you are looking for practicality, look elsewhere. Not just because of the weight and style, but because of the need to wind it 25 to 30 times once a week. Not that this is a big deal, but it is something that one could easily forget to do.Overall, this is a fine quality watch that I recommend to people who are looking for something classy. I liken it to those who prefer fountain pens over ballpoint; not the most practical, but has an appeal for the right audience.Note: the box I received looks different from the red one pictured in the product images.

"The headset is lightweight and surprisingly comfortable given the large size. The plastic build feels a little cheap, but that's part of what keeps the weight down. I found I could wear them for hours without feeling uncomfortable. They do feel a bit bulky when laying my head against a pillow, but didn't get in the way when wearing glasses -- never once did the headphones press the earpieces into my skin. They fit snugly without adding excess pressure against the skull.It's important to note that these are open back headphones; not designed for noise isolation. If you want to put these bad boys on and tune out the world, look elsewhere. Logically, SteelSeries made these open back with the PS4 in mind; designing them for people who want chat audio alone. This means you can put both earcups on and still hear the external audio (eg. game music and sound effects) put out by your TV or stereo speakers. Think of it as having chatting internal and gaming music/sound external. You can hear your buddy cursing in your ear after you got in a good headshot, but only have the sound of the sniper rifle available for outside ears. A good privacy feature without muting your 1000-watt sub-woofer (assuming you have one).That said, know that you can set them to pump in both chat AND game audio. This isn't set on the PS4 by default, however. You'll need to go into your settings and click on ""Devices."" From there, select ""Audio Devices."" Under ""Output to Headphones"" select ""All Audio."" Now you have full privacy with both chat and game audio, but keep in mind you will hear outside noises when the sound output is low.I found the audio cable to be a bit long for hooking into the PS4 controller. I'm a 6' man with pretty long arms, and there was still a fair amount of slack between my ears and my extended arms (where I hold the controller). This extra bit of slack in the cable was slightly annoying as it bunched up and got in the way. I'd have preferred the audio cable to be removable/replaceable so that I could swap it out with the exact length that suites me, but as it is the cable is permanently attached to the left ear-cup.I do have a PS3, but honestly didn't bother to set this headset up with it. Unlike the PS4 where you can plug the headset into the controller, you'll need to find a convenient way to plug them into your audio system. For most people this will require an audio extension cable. Which, to me, is kinda annoying and a bit outdated.In reality, this headset isn't limited to either the PS3 or PS4 gaming system. Any device with a standard audio jack can be hooked up. And since there's a mic, you can even use them with your smartphone for phone calls. I tested them on the PS4, Wii U, Laptop, Chromebook and smartphone (LG G4).The sound quality is actually pretty good as long as your device is setup with the right drivers. I had a laptop running Windows 10 and the audio it outputted was flat, but I fixed that by updating the drivers. There is deep bass (considering the open back) and somewhat crisp highs. I say somewhat crisp because I noticed a few notes that just don't hit it as clearly as Bose headphones I tried. That said, for the price range, the sound quality is quite good. I did notice some popping distortion on loud explosions when hooked to the Wii U, but not on the PS4.Overall, I like these headphones for the price range. I did noticed that sweat builds up in the earcups pretty fast, so I recommend avoiding any sort of physical activity while wearing them (or time spent out in the sun).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29C43RYT64O9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3ODTS#wasThisHelpful","R29C43RYT64O9B","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is essentially the mini version of the Zing Air Storm Fire Tek Bow. Sized for younger kids (5+) with indoor play potential. It is also designed to be used in an office for those big kids who get bored of sitting in their cubicles (I am guilty of that). All joking aside, the box does say it is fun for: Home, Office and Outside. However, I find that it is less comfortable for adults and older kids because the hand hold is so small.One of the reasons the manufacturer says the bow is OK for indoor use is because the release isn't as powerful as the larger bow. Even with the string pulled fully back, the arrows traveled about a quarter of the distance (the box says up to 35ft whereas the Fire Tek Bow goes up to 125ft). This, of course, makes it less dangerous in the house as there is less power to cause heavy damage. That said, it can still knock over things such as vases. The first time my 6-year-old took aim at the closet doors, she somehow managed to fling a picture off the wall instead. Is this good for indoor play? I'd say it can be, but only under a controlled setting (such as an unfinished basement).Keep in mind that these arrows are of the suction cup variety, not the soft tip ones that whistle in the air and bounce a good distance when hitting the ground. I find that the suction cups don't travel as far since they are heavier and less aerodynamic, but they do stick on smooth, flat surfaces. I shot a few arrows against my car window and against a closet door. In both cases the arrows stuck, but only held for about 15 seconds. Not to mention I had to get the arrow lined up just right or it would bounce off the surface instead of stick.The light-up ability of the arrows is pretty cool. My daughter was thrilled when she saw them glowing in the dark. But this was inside the house with the lights off. I found I couldn't see the glow outside in the daytime. But it does work good at night and makes shot arrows easier to locate.Because this is a mini version of the Fire Bow, the build is more fragile. The arrow shaft and fletching (aka feathers) are very thin and can be damaged more easily. This makes outdoor play somewhat risky, as outdoor play is often rougher on toys.Overall, this bow is nice if you are looking for a smaller size and something geared more for indoor play. But I find that the larger, Fire Bow is better built and can still be used by younger children. If you don't need the smaller size, I recommend getting the bigger bow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93IFH4VZC4KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QV8LXZ6#wasThisHelpful","R93IFH4VZC4KG","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I let my facial hair grow out to about 0.5 centimeters (0.2"") and gave it a full cut with the Remington PF7500. I did not perform any pre-shaving steps, just went right in to see how well the Remington would cut hair that long. It actually did a pretty good job. It cut really close to my skin making it look as smooth as if I had taken a traditional razorblade to it.There was a few places where the device tugged, causing me to flinch, but that was expected with hair at that length. Overall, the shaver was fast enough to keep up with cutting to avoid too much pain. I also came across a few places where the razor had trouble clipping the hairs, especially on my neck. The manual says to stretch the skin with your free hand so that the hairs stand upright, but I still came across a few rebels. Thankfully, the retractable trimmer made quick work of them, so this wasn't a problem.I like that the foils can be rinsed directly under running water, which makes cleaning a quick and painless task. It does recommend to soap them and do a more thorough cleaning once a month, but even that isn't too vigorous or time consuming.An advantage with this PF7500 over the PF7400 is that you can shave with the cord attached should the battery go dead before you finish. There is also a quick charge feature which promises one shave worth of power after a 5 min charge. That said, if you want to shave in the shower or with gels, you'll need to buy the PF7600 since both the PF7500 and PF7400 only support a dry shave.For those who had issues after using this device, keep in mind that the manufacturer recommends using it daily for three weeks to allow time for your hair and skin to become accustomed to the new shaving system. I also recommend keeping your original sales receipt as the limited two-year warranty requires it as proof of purchase. Of course, if you buy this online through Amazon, you can always print it off later.Overall, I'm happy with this shaver. It cuts well, holds a good charge and is easy to keep clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RQ0V4ITMPKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8FEG0M#wasThisHelpful","R20RQ0V4ITMPKB","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn’t much to this toy organizer -- a mesh bag and some suction cups -- but sometimes simple is better. I’ve been testing it for over a month now and have been happy with the results. The material has held together well and the suction cups continue to hold strong against the plastic surface of my shower.Because the bag that holds the toys are mesh, you can put the toys in it while they are still wet. The water will slowly drip out and into your tub (assuming you have it placed correctly). I did notice some slight discoloration on the mesh material where the water was heavier, but overall it still looks clean.The individual suction cups work well for holding bath scrunchies and have also stayed attached without falling. I recommend adding a little water to the suction cups before attaching just to be sure there’s enough moisture to aid in the gripping.Overall, this bath toy organizer works well for the purpose it was created.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZIBOXZMKWJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK75OZ6#wasThisHelpful","RQZIBOXZMKWJI","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was definitely long enough for our outdoor umbrella, with some room to spare. The 100% woven polyester fabric feels sturdy even though it’s only one layer thick, and the stitching is well positioned with no apparent flaws. The drawstring hem cord doesn’t pull the bottom completely shut; there’s approximately a 5” gap (excluding the umbrella poll) at the tightest I could get it. That said, I was able to twist the fabric and use the loose part of the hem cord to wrap around and totally close off the opening (see the photos I uploaded).Overall, this cover does a good job of keeping rain and water off the umbrella as well as protects it from fading caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFOEBENX4YFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRMBZG8#wasThisHelpful","R2BFOEBENX4YFG","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The game, Jenga, has been around since the early 1970s and is appealing for its simplicity of rules and focus on physical concentration. Now, many years later, it's still sold in stores but has become a bit stale for some individuals. That's why adding the random and unexpected vibration (quake) gives this classic game another level of interest and enjoyment . . . and frustration? The quakes are intermittent and some last longer than others, but ultimately I find that none of them are massive enough to overly mess up your strategy.Overall, I enjoyed the extra feature, but I did find I missed having wooden blocks.

"This review is for the Belkin FormFit Cover / Case for iPad Air (Lavender). Since there are several options, this review may not cover all the cases that are under this product page.One of the negative items I’ve seen under reviews for this product is people who’s iPad did not fit the case properly. With the case I’m reviewing, I do not have this problem. In fact, the case fits the iPad very tightly and I absolutely have no concerns with it falling out. All the cutouts perfectly match the position of the buttons, speakers, camera, volume, audio port and other items. If someone has a problem with this case fitting properly, I’d assume it’s because they are trying to get it to fit the iPad Air 2, not the iPad Air 1. Though the two different models are close in size, there are some differences such as the position of the camera and thickness of the body. These differences are enough to mess with the proportions of this case. This case is not for the Air 2, but the first generation.Another comment I’ve see is people not getting the cover to power the screen on and off. Like above, I do not have this issue with my version of the case. The magnets in the cover match my iPad Air perfectly so that when I open and close it, my screen turns off and on.The build quality is fairly good; thick enough to handle a drop but not too thick as to bulk up the device. The plastic seems solid and sturdy and all the materials are soft to the touch. This soft material does mean that there isn’t a lot of friction, so the chance of it slipping out of your hand and dropping to the ground is more likely. I haven’t done this, thankfully, so it hasn’t been a problem for me. The stitching is also well done and positioned well; no frayed areas or missing threads.The clip that keeps the cover shut could be a little better. It snaps to the plastic edge, but I can see this wearing out over time. I prefer ones that stretch from the back and hold the cover shut magnetically. Also, because the clip is attached to the cover, it gets in the way when you fold the cover back to hold the device vertically (like a book). It sticks outward and gets in the way of my fingers. This is my biggest gripe with the case; there’s no good way to get the cover out of the way to hold the iPad vertically. Not only is the clip in the way, but on the left side, the material bulges away from the back rather than lying flat against it. Since the majority of my use with my iPad is for reading, this is a huge negative for me.The case does a decent job as a folio case, meaning, standing the iPad on a surface in a horizontal position. This is good when I use it in my kitchen for recipes. The last case I had would slide and fall out of position, but this one has little divots on the inside of the cover that align with a plastic tab on the side of the case. As long as you line these two items up, the iPad stays upright. The only negative with this is if you want to lay down and have it on your stomach -- such as when you are in bed -- the angle of the iPad isn’t upright enough for me to see it properly in this position. Part of this is due to the soft and bendable section of the case. Why they made it this way I’m not sure, but basically, it leans back to the point where it is only effective on a desk while you are sitting in a chair or standing up on your feet. This means watching videos while laying down isn’t the best fit; because I still end up having to hold the iPad upright with my hand (or lean it against my bent legs).Overall, I think the build quality is pretty good with this case, but if you want a case that gets the cover out of the way so you can hold it while reading, you may want to look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDGUOP4HDFT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSB5XQW#wasThisHelpful","R1TDGUOP4HDFT8","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In general, Hershey's is not known for high quality chocolate. It's a chocolate that appeals to children, particularly served around the firepit to create smores. However, that's not the case with this bag of Nuggets Milk Chocolate with Toffee and Almonds.Granted, it's milk chocolate, not dark. I've found that most adults prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate. That said, taste is unique to the individual, and in the case of this chocolate I'd say the addition of the toffee and almonds help to appeal to an adult palate.In fact, my six-year-old took a bite and instantly thought this chocolate was yucky. My wife on the other hand couldn't get enough. It's addicting, and I found myself unwrapping more than I intended to eat.You are getting 3.75 Pounds of chocolate. I don't recommend this for keeping around the house because, if you are like me, you will eat too much. But it is a great option for parties, weddings, and bigger events. You can feel confident that your adult friends and family will like this; it goes against the grain of Hershey's being a kids chocolate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N97PTLTTG4KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3WWWUG#wasThisHelpful","R3N97PTLTTG4KL","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife saw this in an infomercial. Unlike most infomercials, this product stood out to her as something she wanted to try. Why? Because she has super fine hair, and most products don't do much for adding body.When giving the InStyler a whirl, it was a little confusing at first. So I went to the InStyler website and watched a few videos. The most relevant one was the video named, ""Fine or Thin Hair."" The hair on the model used in the video had much thicker hair than my wife, so when I sat her down in a chair and followed the directions, I wasn't entirely surprised when we had no positive results.Next we took the InStyler to a friend's house and tried it on her. There were better results as this friend had thicker hair. However, the friend still preferred her Perfecter Fusion Styler over this one. So next I tried it on my mother.My mother has really thick, frizzy hair. Which is often out of control and hard to manage. When using the InStyler on her we were met with pretty amazing results. The frizzles vanished and was replaced with slick, silky hair. My 5-year-old daughter even commented on it saying, ""Grandma, your hair looks really soft.""Unfortunately, the InStyler proved to be ineffective on my wife's thin hair, but it did prove to be useful for thicker hair. It even did wonders for making a grandma look classy :-)Just be warned that the InStyler roller gets extremely hot. We're talking 225 - 430°F, so be careful and keep it out of the reach of children.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3KFKCMH5QUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ8V5I#wasThisHelpful","R2G3KFKCMH5QUT","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was mainly interested in these glasses for motorcycle riding. I have a pair of eye-wear with sun protection that works well during the day, but are hard to see through at nighttime. Because these contained the amber lenses, they act as a type of blue blockers, which work good at night (and in rain). They are larger than I expected, which wasn't a problem, but because the shape of my face is narrow, the bottom portion is not sealed. Too much air flows under the eye lenses; the seal is not tight. I also tested these for construction projects around the house, but found the lack of a full seal to be limiting. For instance, sawdust gets in under the bottom and into my eyes. In reality, these glasses are best for those who have a more rounded face.The manual states that this eyewear is not intended to provide protection against sun glare. They are intended for indoor and outdoor use where no optical radiation hazards exist other than solar radiation. They are intended to provide adequate protection against sun glare and ultraviolet radiation from the sun. But as stated, on a limited basis.They are listed as impact-resistant, but I saw no mention of them being shatter proof. Which means a rock to the eye at high speeds on a motorcycle comes with some risk.I like that there is a strap for a tight fit, particularly useful when facing strong winds on a bike. But overall they were not the right solution for the shape of my face.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BZMQISTYS01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAYZTTE#wasThisHelpful","R38BZMQISTYS01","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been sporting a goatee for several months and so I figured I'd give the Conair Flex Trimmer a try. The build feels a little cheap, but at the same time this makes the device light. It cuts quickly and sharply enough so that there are no snags or tugs. I did noticed that, even though there are 24 length settings, even on max (5.0mm) it cuts fairly short -- therefore this may not be a good device if you want to manage a longer beard. That said, if you are just trying to maintain stubble or a shorter length, I find the more precise settings to be fairly effective.Keep in mind that, with the low price comes some sacrifices. For instance, the blade does not self sharpen and you need to keep it oiled (for first use and then from time to time). Also, even though the trimmer boasts of being wireless, it requires 2 AAA batteries (not included, mind you) -- which means it is not rechargeable. For some people that would be an instant deal breaker; especially considering how standard it is for trimmers to come with charging ability in this day and age.The swiveling head is nice and the comb guide can be detach for easier cleaning (and detailing/shaping), but hair does get trapped under the blade and requires some wiggling and blowing to clean out. Keep in mind that you cannot clean the hair out with water like you can with other, higher-end trimmers. Not without detaching the blades from the unit itself (which you can, but if you do, be sure to oil them after), and you'll need to make sure they are dry before reattaching.Overall, you get what you pay for. A decent operating trimmer but with few bells and whistles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6FT1TCTC0WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UISX7Y0#wasThisHelpful","R3V6FT1TCTC0WO","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The purifier works well with only a few negatives. There are three fan speeds, but the top setting isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. I have another unit that can clear a room quickly should our wood burning stove get backed up or something catch on fire when cooking. The Febreze HEPA-Type Tower Air Purifier doesn't have the power or the push to operate as efficiently. However, under normal (more mild) uses, it keeps up fairly well.The slow setting produces a really soft blow, which would be close to silent if it wasn't for the fan motor that produces a slight buzzing sound. When set to medium or high, the buzzing isn't noticeable, but on low it could become a bit annoying if you focus on it. If your intention is to use this unit for white noise -- such as when sleeping -- you'll want it set to medium or above.The Febreze scent cartridges only last for 30-days, and that's with minimal usage. It's possible to go through several per month if you have the scent intensity dial turned up. At approximately $5.00 each, it could get a bit costly. If the scent option is important to you, keep that in mind when calculating total cost. Thankfully, if you don't need the scent, you can operate the purifier without having a cartridge in it at all.The filters need to be replaced every four months or so. For the larger unit, you need two filters which puts the cost around $30. That's $90 a year, closer to $100 when calculating tax and [possibly] shipping. Keep in mind you may need to replace them sooner if you use the purifier more heavily. Note that the manufacturer states you cannot clean the filters to extend their life. Water will destroy them. However, I find that a vacuum hose with a soft brush attachment can be fairly effective at removing partial dust buildup.With scent and filter, you're looking at around $160 per year. More for heavy users. If those costs are fine with you, then this unit isn't a bad option, especially since the retail price of the unit itself is lower than others I have seen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAT2MC4TB2JAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP292QC#wasThisHelpful","RAT2MC4TB2JAZ","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Has a nice, rich flavor. Not watered down or weak even with the added cream. I like black tea made in my Keurig Brewer over the traditional tea bag because the brewer makes it slightly frothy and takes the guesswork out of the seap time.

"My wife bought our godson the SodaStream Play Soda Maker years ago from Bed Bath & Beyond. As a heavy pop drinker myself, I admit to being a little jealous. That's why I was thrilled to have a chance to test out this KitchenAid adaption.As is typical with the KitchenAid brand, this device is very well built. Solid, sturdy. Much heavier than I expected; not plastic or cheap. I have no worries of it tipping over or getting knocked down. The quality blows away the one we got our godson.That said, there is one issue with it being such a grand device; it's big. Very big. From counter to the top of the handle it nearly measures 18"". Because of this, I wasn't able to get the device to fit under my cabinets. Thankfully there was one spot on my counter that had no cabinets above, but keep this in mind for your situation.I like that there is no power cable to plug in and get in the way; just 3 AAA batteries that are included. The process of carbonating water is very quick and simple too: takes less than a minute. What surprised me the most was how good regular old water tasted when carbonated. In the past I tried sparkling waters, but their flavorings never appealed to my palate. With this device I'm able to make regular water, sparkly. And it's pretty good!There are quite a few Sodamix flavors out there too, and they are healthier than buying most pop -- if only because you can get them without the high-fructose corn syrup (google this and you will see how bad this stuff is). For around $6, you can get up to 12 liters worth of cola, Dr. Pete, root beer or whathaveyou. And if you don't mind voiding the warranty and risking gunking up the machine, search for the article ""Hacking Home Soda-Making Machines"" written on the NYTimes for other uses, such as making sparkling wine. I'm not yet courageous enough to try this for myself, but it's interesting to see what others have done.Replacing the CO2 carbonator is fairly simple. You can see a list of SodaStream authorized retailers on their website, but I find my local Bed Bath & Beyond is the best place to go. They will swap your old cartridge with a new one, which is cheaper than buying a full replacement.Overall I am very happy with this device. It has the highest quality build of any SodaStream beverage maker I have seen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHOJBWIAY00CM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REP57DO#wasThisHelpful","RHOJBWIAY00CM","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amped Wireless AC1750 was fairly easy to set up. It comes with an installation video on a CD that you can watch, or you can just follow through with the written instructions. I came across a slight problem in that this router is set to 192.168.3.1 by default, whereas most others I've tested are 192.168.0.1. This wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that I had two devices on my network with custom IP addresses assigned (e.g. 192.168.0.143). This meant that those systems didn't work automatically like they had in the past when switching routers, but it was a simple matter of changing the device settings from ""0"" to ""3."" (Note: I could also have set the router's IP address to 192.168.0.1, but figured I'd stick to the defaults for testing purposes.)The admin interface is easy to use, and you can adjust a fair amount of custom settings such as lowering the wireless coverage and blocking websites. Pretty standard stuff. A lot of the more advanced settings -- such as QoS Engine -- comes disabled by default, which is nice since those options can actually cause issues with certain devices (e.g. my iPad 2 hates QoS for some reason). I like that it gives basic users the minimum of what they need to get going, without forcing advanced options onto them. Yet more advanced users can still make their tweeks in the admin. Setting up forwarding was really simple too. Such as Remote Desktop and HTTP. No issues there whatsoever. Connecting to my company's VPN worked like a charm as well.You have the ability to plug in a USB hard drive to use as a network drive, good for storing music and video files that can be accessed by other devices. You can even have the router create an FTP that writes to that drive (however, I had some issues getting the FTP working, but haven't messed around with it long enough to figure out what the issue is).Some users complained of poor range and bad video streaming. Thankfully I didn't have a problem with either. Connected to a MOTOROLA SB6121 SURFboard Cable Modem and Comcast internet, my connection and performance is steady and consistent. I was able to have Netflix playing on an iPad and Smart TV simultaneously without a hiccup in the streaming. I also have it connected to a D-Link Wireless Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera without any issues -- it connects all the way from my basement to the outside of my garage.I like that there is a power button on the Amped Wireless AC1750; I can perform a power cycle without having to unplug it. Another nice feature -- and the first time I've seen this on any router -- is the ability to turn off the blinking activity lights. This makes my office feel less like an alien ship is trying to land in it. If you have this router in an active place, such as a living room, you may find it nice to disable those annoying flashing lights.I really don't have many negatives to speak of with the Amped Wireless AC1750, however I found that I like my D-Link Wireless AC1900 a bit better. Both have 5GHz and 2.4GHz channels and similar capabilities in other areas, but I found my D-Link had a bit more solid of a connection at greater distances (I was able to get full bars on the D-Link from across the street and into my neighbor's driveway, plus the outside camera ran a little smoother while on it). The D-Link is built more solid and has larger antennas. That said, both are fairly decent routers and I would be perfectly happy with either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1W7Y81Z0WQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQ7SLDO#wasThisHelpful","R2G1W7Y81Z0WQP","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have mixed feelings about this unit. The build quality is good, with a rubbery skin to help keep moisture out (amplifying the ""beach"" quality of the unit). The buttons up top are easy to access, even without looking directly at them since they stick out -- you can tell what they are by touch alone (which is nice if you are laying back and relaxing with your eyes closed).The stand works good and there's no jumping/bouncing of the unit even when the volume is maxed. Speaking of which, the volume goes fairly high and the sound can easily be heard outdoors.The multiple international adapters truly make this unit a great choice for the world traveler. As for myself, I only need the USA version, but it's nice to know I have other options in the future.For guys like myself, the carrying case feels awkwardly like a purse. In fact my wife got a good laugh out of me carrying it around. I've never been a murse kinda guy, so this didn't quite fit my style. That said, I can toss the speaker into a backpack and leave the case at home.Now, here's my more negative findings with the device. Firstly, when turning the device on, there's a steady flow of white noise coming from the speakers. It reminds me of the sound cassettes would make when playing a blank spot on the tape. It's not super loud, and mostly gets covered when music is playing, but if you are in a quiet room trying to get a peaceful rest with soft classical music playing, you may find that noise annoying.The speakers produce a fairly full midrange sound, but the bass is pretty weak. It's also a bit lacking in the crisp high pitches, but is better than other units I've tested. A lack of deep bass is to be expected in a device of this size, but I do feel as if it could be a little better.It's true that the international adapters are nice, but it also means the charging cable is specialized. Meaning, you can't just plug the speaker into the same standard micro USB adapter you use to charge your phone, tablet or headset. In fact, you can't charge the speaker through a USB adapter of any kind, which means [when traveling] you need to carry the specialized power cable around with you in addition to the speaker itself. I personally prefer to declutter cables and use something that works with multiple devices.Finally, and this is what I consider the biggest negative, is the limited range between the connecting device and the speaker. I used my Samsung Galaxy S5 to connect, which should produce a fairly strong signal, but when putting my phone in my pocket and walking to another room, the connection breaks in and out (the song stutters so to say). At first I questioned my phone, but then I connected to another bluetooth speaker (RND Ripple) and put my phone in my pocket and left the room, the connection didn't hesitate at all. Which means the NYNE is at fault.Overall, the NYNE is a decent device. I like how it is customized for portability and durability, but I'm a bit disappointed with the white noise, poor connectivity, and lack of deep bass. Personally I find I like my RND Ripple better, which is less expensive, smaller, connects better, can be charged by micro USB, and has better bass. But it lacks the waterproofing, higher pitch, raised buttons, ""other device"" charging, international adapters and carrying case of the NYNE. So they both have their positives and negatives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QK255IFWBA6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9ID070#wasThisHelpful","R2QK255IFWBA6D","A3AG5QAT8L0I3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AG5QAT8L0I3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book seemed to me to have a number of goals. Andrews' primary goal seemed to be to provide a careful delineation and defense of Nabokov's ""aestheticism"" and to distinguish it from the popular slogan of ""art for art's sake"". Andrews argues that, if we understand Nabokov's aestheticism correctly, it does not fall prey to the critiques that are often leveled at proponents of ""art for art's sake"". Andrews argues that ""art for art's sake"" is really a more specific form of aestheticism and ""What makes 'art for art's sake' more specific than 'aestheticism' is that the former stipulates what 'art,' 'beauty,' and 'taste' are not while the latter stipulates nothing"" (13) To be more specific, art for art's sake stipulates that art, beauty, and taste are radically distinct from questions relating to morality, truth, social consciousness, and other practical and pragmatic concerns. Whether something is beautiful is a radically different question from whether it is moral or true or socially responsible. Beauty becomes something radically divorced from experience and the concerns of everyday life.Aestheticism, on the other hand, does not stipulate what art, beauty, and taste are not. It merely argues that art's primary concern is to produce an aesthetic effect, whatever that may involve, and, in fact, Nabokov, in his famous afterword to Lolita, seems to suggest it involves curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy. Andrews discusses some of the dangers of ""art for art's sake"": ""the art-for-art's-sake aesthete may inadvertently create or fall under the influence of an immoral book; may isolate himself in an ivory tower, prioritizing art at the expense of human experience; may waste time on empty or overrefined stylization; and may pursue a vacuous notion of beauty through a self-indulgent distortion of Walter Pater's hedonism"" (13) Andrews discussion of the dangers of art for art's sake in that passage seemed a bit abstract to me but Andrews makes the dangers more concrete in his discussion of Leni Riefenstahl's films. Riefenstahl's films were made for the Nazis, and served essentially as Nazi propaganda, but Riefenstahl always argued she was concerned only with beauty, and the films were defended at one time by Susan Sontag I believe, on the grounds that they were beautiful. The problem is that aesthetics becomes so divorced from the realities of the world that the supposed ""aesthetic effect"" of Nazi propaganda films becomes independent of their more nefarious and equally powerful effects as Nazi propaganda tools. Andrews spends the first part of the book arguing that Nabokov's aestheticism does not fall prey to these critiques and problems since, for Nabokov, the aesthetic effect is not entirely divorced from what we might call moral emotions - curiosity, tenderness, kindness - and is based upon an absolute respect for the uniqueness of reality.Andrews also attempts to define Nabokov's aesthetic in this book. Nabokov's aestheticism is ""an ideology that emphasizes careful perception of all phases of worldly uniqueness"" (40) The reason an artwork ""cannot be reduced to its ideas"" is ""because its value is a function of its total uniqueness as a thing"" (40) Nabokov's aesthetic is also an aesthetic based on balance between the imagination and the artist's ""duty to create new and unique things"" and the equal duty to ""respect extant but equally unique things"" (53) Imaginative invention should not be merely a mask for ignorance, i.e the artist should not say ""I do not know, therefore, I will invent."" Nabokov was very careful that the detail in his books was accurate. Nabokov has a beautiful phrase summarizing this aspect of his aesthetic, ""Does there not exist a high ridge where the mountainside of 'scientific' knowledge joins the opposite slope of 'artistic imagination?"" (53-54) As Brian Boyd argues in his book on Pale Fire, Nabokov sees a similarity between the aesthetic effect produced by a work of art and the wonder experienced by the scientist investigating reality. Both must respect reality and not substitute their own subjective feelings for that reality.While Nabokov's aesthetic emphasizes a careful attention to reality, it is not purely mimetic. The artist's objective is not ""to represent a prior reality"" (54) Nabokov uses the example of butterfly mimicry to illustrate the function of art. The butterfly must ""pay attention"" to reality in order to mimic it in its camouflage, but it does not merely copy reality. Nabokov follows nature's example since, ""both art and nature rely on a mimetic technique that requires attention to prior realities. Consequently, Nabokov's creative process puts its main emphasis neither on being 'realistic nor on being 'naturalist' but rather on being 'real' and 'natural' - i.e. on being in tune with nature's creative processes"" (55) Rather than copy a product of nature's creative process, Nabokov mimics nature's creative process itself, since both art and nature mimic in order to deceive. Andrews argues that Nabokov's aesthetic combines elements of the mimetic, formalist, and the expressionist aesthetics, but cannot be reduced to any of them in their traditional forms.Finally, Andrews provides a reading of Lolita in terms of Nabokov's aestheticism as defined in the first half of the book. I thought Andrews provided one of the more interesting readings of Lolita I have come across. For Andrews, Humbert represents a kind of parody of Nabokov's aesthetic ideas, which is why Nabokov and Humbert have often been simply identified, and Nabokov criticized for Humbert's lack of moral compass. Humbert represents an art-for-art's-sake aesthete who uses his aestheticism as a mask for his ruthless hedonism. There is a distinction between ""Humbert-the-artist"" who claims that his love for Lolita is ""an appreciation for beauty"" and ""Humbert-the character's"" hedonism which ""leads him to treat the objects of his appreciation in a careless, generic, and utilitarian manner"" (72) Andrews points out that Humbert is often ""identified with apes and spiders, both of which prey on butterflies - the insects most often identified with Lolita"" (74)Andrews makes an interesting point about John Ray's foreword as well. John Ray winds up justifying Lolita's destruction because it serves a moral purpose ""for in this poignant story there lurks a general lesson"" (Lolita, 5) This points to a similarity between Humbert and John Ray. Both are willing to sacrifice the individual - Dolores Haze - for a utilitarian aim. It makes little difference that Humbert's aim is purely personal - satisfaction and pleasure - and John Ray's is communal - the bettering of society. Both fail to respect Lolita's uniqueness. We can see why it is a mistake to accuse Nabokov's aesthetic of being ""immoral"". It is the didactic, moralistic novel that winds up being immoral because it uses individuals for its own purpose. Only art respects the uniqueness of the individual as an individual.Andrews also makes another very interesting point about the novel: Nabokov's words and Humbert's words are identical but their intentions are not the same. Humbert is trying to deceive the reader, influence the jury, and justify his behavior. Humbert's intention is self-serving. Nabokov's intention is more complex and will depend upon one's interpretation of the novel. It seems clear that, at the very least, Nabokov is attempting to produce curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy in the reader, and to critique Humbert's version of aestheticism. Andrews argued earlier on in the book that Nabokov's aesthetic is expressionistic to the degree that Nabokov thought the artist's intention was important in interpreting a work of art. This means: the intention behind a work can influence whether it is a good or bad piece of art. If Humbert was the real writer of Lolita it would be a bad piece of art, for the same reason that Leni Riefenstahl's films are bad films, they were made with a bad intention. If a pedophile on trial for murder had written Lolita all the florid prose in the world would not save it from universal condemnation. We would sense the self-serving purpose behind the prose and feel sick when reading it. But a novelist can write the exact same novel and it can become a classic. The fact that Humbert is a creation of Nabokov, and the ""internal filmmaker's aestheticism"" is the object of critique ""by the external filmmaker"" makes Lolita great art (97) Humbert wishes to immortalize his own subjective perception of Lolita as a nymphet but Nabokov makes us pity the real but ultimately unknowable Lolita. This is why the aesthetic effect is different between the two works.Andrews also makes a good point in the conclusion relating to John Dewey's philosophy of art ""Didactic artworks convey orthodox truths through orthodox structures, reinforcing prejudice rather than dispersing it"" (129) In this book, Andrews makes his case that aestheticism and morality are not at odds by distinguishing between different brands of aestheticism but, I think, one might also distinguish between different brands of morality. There is a morality that is based on custom which is often severely immoral, and is often the object of critique of moralists and philosophers (Plato, Nietzsche, Faulkner all critiqued customary morality, but not in the name of ""anything goes"" immorality). There is also a morality that is more in line with Dewey's definition as ""an activity, a process through which the individual sharpens his awareness"" (129). Aestheticism and morality would only be in conflict if one is thinking of social morality. A work of art may offend the current social mores prevalent in society but, a good work of art is always in the service of the sharpening of our awareness, an increase of our understanding, and our pity for our fellow human beings. Art serves a higher form of morality without that purpose conflicting with its aesthetic purpose.All in all, I thought Andrews book raised a number of important issues, provided a decent summary of Nabokov's aesthetic, and provided a very interesting reading of Lolita. If I had to point to any flaws I would say that Andrews seemed to me to get a little too obsessed with all of his distinctions between different forms of ""art-for-art's-sake"" even resorting to subscripts to distinguish between all of them. I do not think that is where the real interest of this work lies. Andrews also sometimes dismisses, or at least attempts to attenuate, statements made by Nabokov that seem to contradict Andrews' theses by claiming that they are the result of Nabokov's ""dogmatic moods"" (38) He may be right, but it is always a bit dangerous to start cherry-picking which comments an author really meant to be taken literally, and which statements were merely the result of a ""dogmatic mood"". It becomes pretty easy to defend any thesis if you are willing to dismiss anything that does not align with it as the result of a momentary mood. Those flaws aside, the book is still worth reading for anyone interested in Nabokov, Lolita, or the general issue of aestheticism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFGG8N8Q0D25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0773479600#wasThisHelpful","R1OFGG8N8Q0D25","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit skeptical about this book. I love reading literary criticism, which is one step removed from reading actual literature, but I gathered from the title that this volume would be a history of the criticism surrounding Lolita, which would be a step removed from reading actual literary criticism and a second step removed from reading actual literature, and I was worried that might be a step too far. Pretty soon I might be reading histories of the histories of the criticism surrounding Lolita and staring blankly at the sky. In reality, this volume presents excerpts from influential critical works on Lolita spanning five decades. Each chapter covers a decade, beginning with the 50s and ending with the 90s, and Christine Clegg has pulled excerpts from the most influential essays written on Lolita in each decade, interspersed with her own comments.After reading the book, I feel my fears were unfounded. This is literary criticism, plain and simple. Christine Clegg has compiled a ton of excerpts that approach Lolita from many different angles and it is the perfect way for someone interested in Lolita to get a sense of which avenues they would like to pursue in more depth. The reader of this volume will get excerpts from all of the most important essays written on Lolita in the past 50 years: from Lionel Trilling's famous essay, through Richard Rorty and his analysis of cruelty, and the feminist readings of the 80s and 90s.Lolita is a tough nut to crack. Personally, I do not feel that any of the authors in this volume fully cracked it, or answered all the lingering questions I still have about the novel. All of the authors excerpted in this volume have interesting insights to offer - insights into Nabokov's use of language, the relationship between morality and aesthetics, insights into the character of Lolita, etc. -  but I do not feel like anyone has presented a complete reading of the novel that I find entirely satisfying. However, this volume does succeed in raising a number of very interesting questions: To what degree should we trust Humbert's narrative? What is the relationship between the ""real"" Lolita and the Lolita that Humbert creates in his imagination and attempts to immortalize through art? What is the relationship between morality and aesthetics in the novel? and many more.These are the questions I will bring to my next reading of Nabokov's text as I search for that fully satisfying reading that may wind up being as much a figment of my imagination as Humbert's perfect nymphet. Reading is not a passive activity. The enjoyment we get from literary texts is often a function of the degree to which we participate by asking questions of the text. This text gives the reader of Lolita a mountain of questions with which to approach the text and will turn any potential reader into a literary detective combing through every detail in search of clues. Whether the reader solves the ultimate mystery or not that kind of attentiveness will certainly reveal many hidden gems. I heartily recommend this volume to anyone interested in Lolita.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19P6FMUI7NLYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184046173X#wasThisHelpful","R19P6FMUI7NLYH","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lehan provides a fairly satisfying reading of The Great Gatsby, its themes, and its language in this book. Lehan reads the novel as a movement from romantic possibilities to a corrupt reality: ""The green breast of the new world...gives way to the valley of ashes; the dream of an idealized love gives way to adultery and death; and the idea of a just God gives way to blind eyes overlooking a physical wasteland and to characters who continually missee when they see at all"" (124). Lehan provides a good analysis of all the major characters in the novel and also provides a good chronology that helps the reader grasp the symmetrical structure of the novel - centering around the central reunion between Gatsby and Daisy in chapter 5 - and provides insight into some of the recurring metaphors and tropes that structure the themes of the novel. Lehan makes the interesting point that the symbolic language in the novel ""undercuts a strict literal and realistic reading"" of the text. The symbolic relationships are more important than the literal chronology, i.e. the ""movement from summer to winter, from youth to early adulthood, from romantic expectation to disillusionment, from life to death, from the pastoral to tragic, from the ideal to the grotesque, from the spiritual to the material"" (132)Lehan also provides some very interesting quotes from Fitzgerald's correspondence. In one quote Fitzgerald wrote that, ""The worst fault in [The Great Gatsby], I think is a big fault: I gave no account (and had no feeling about or knowledge of) the emotional relations between Gatsby and Daisy from the time of their reunion to the catastrophe. However, the lack is so astutely concealed by the retrospect of Gatsby's past and by the blankets of excellent prose that no one has noticed it - tho everyone has felt the lack and called it by another name"" (125) I think this is an interesting quote because I think Fitzgerald does put his finger on a genuine flaw in the novel but it is one that - as Fitgzerald himself recognized - most people (including me) do not consciously notice until it is pointed out to them. Fitzgerald said he did not have a feel for how Daisy would react to someone like Gatsby and that does seem to be a real gap in the novel that I think I did feel on some level. It was like there was an expectation there that was waiting to be filled and never was.Lehan also discusses some of the real characters behind the novel and provides a little biographical detail. Fitzgerald apparently had his heart broken by a woman named Ginevra and that experience had a profound effect on his life and his work. Lehan explains the way that experience produced what I think is the dominant aesthetic of the novel, ""When Fitzgerald lost Ginevra, he came to believe that such yearning was an end in itself; he believed in the need to preserve a romantic state of mind where the imagination and the will are arrested - in a state of suspension - by an idealized concept of beauty and love. The loss creates an eternal striving, and hope keeps the world beautifully alive"" (72) The reason readers respond to this novel on such a deep level is because they can feel that aesthetic operating in the background. It was nice to have it stated so plainly.While Lehan's book increased my appreciation for Fitzgerald's novel I felt it suffered from a couple of flaws. Actually, there is really one main flaw. Lehan is constantly comparing the themes of The Great Gatsby to the themes of other Fitzgerald stories or other novels written by other authors. I think the idea was to highlight the themes of The Great Gatsby by comparing and contrasting them with the same themes as they appear in other works. However, I rarely found this very enlightening. I did not think it added much to the simple statement of the theme and the drawback was Lehan had to spend a fair amount of time summarizing the stories or novels he is comparing The Great Gatsby to since he cannot assume the reader has read those stories. So, he spends paragraphs summarizing Fitzgerald stories like ""Winter Dreams"" and ""The Rich Boy"", and paragraphs summarizing The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon, and A Lost Lady by Willa Cather. It felt a little bit like padding to me and I felt that, in a book that was supposed to be devoted to an analysis of The Great Gatsby, Lehan spent too much time summarizing and analyzing other novels and stories. So, that is my opinion, such as it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQRZW0IM1KGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805780130#wasThisHelpful","RVQRZW0IM1KGC","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Consciousness has proved extremely elusive for science and for philosophy. Even as we have come to understand more and more about the brain the mystery of consciousness has remained one of the most puzzling enigmas of the universe. We are still a long ways away from understanding consciousness but there have been some very interesting developments in the last decade or so and Stanislas Dehaene's book is a great introduction to those developments for the lay person.Dehaene begins by outlining some of the new experimental evidence relating to the study of consciousness. One of the major stumbling blocks for consciousness research has been its seemingly ""subjective"" character. How can a science that aims to study phenomena ""objectively"" deal with phenomena that are fundamentally ""subjective""? Many scientists believed this stumbling block was insurmountable and that consciousness research would always remain within the province of philosophers and mystics. However, scientists have proven resourceful in designing creative experiments that have allowed them to bridge - to some degree at least - that objective-subjective divide and Dehaene introduces the reader to these new experiments and their exciting findings.After providing a great deal of experimental evidence, Dehaene attempts to develop a new theory of consciousness. I am sure Dehaene would be the first to admit that we are still a long ways away from being able to work out a full fledged theory of consciousness that is fully capable of accounting for the phenomenon as a whole. However, Dehaene's theory is a good start and it is a testable theory that can help guide further consciousness research. In brief, Dehaene theorizes that consciousness is a phenomenon that takes place when a phenomenon reaches a critical threshold of importance in the brain and the messages reporting the various aspects of that phenomenon become synchronized and broadcast throughout the brain as a whole.Whether this theory is able to resolve the hard problem, or the explanatory gap, I will leave up to the reader to decide but, whatever the case may be, anyone who is looking for a good, accessible introduction to the current state of consciousness research could not find a better book than Dehaene's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVFMWW16YTN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025437#wasThisHelpful","R2PVFMWW16YTN4","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rainbow is an incredible novel. The novel inevitability overflows the bounds of any attempt to summarize it or encapsulate it. All of the characters in the novel are caught in a dialectic between the known - a circumscribed world of normal human relationships, stable egos, and matter of fact realities - and the unknown - a world of pre-personal desires with obscure and unknown objects and mysterious longings. The novel itself reaches into that unknown region so, any attempt to summarize the novel by pointing to what can be found ""within"" the limits of its pages, fails to capture what is so great and engaging about the novel, namely, the fact that it reaches into the dark and points beyond itself. It is a novel that can be read on many different levels and registers. In this review I will make a feeble effort explain why reading this novel is so rewarding and moving by highlighting three possible registers.The first register of the novel is the register of human relationship. The novel is a beautiful examination of human relationship. I am no expert in the English novel - I have never read Jane Austen, for example - but the stereotypical view of the English novel is that it is a novel of manners and courtship. Once the courtship is over, and the marriage is confirmed, the conflict is over, and the new couple can settle down into a comfortable life together. Lawrence portrays all the turmoil and conflict that arise after a marriage - when two people attempt to accommodate each other and make room for each other. Lawrence makes it clear that marriage is not easy, but he also makes it clear that, without the struggles of human relationship, we can never become the people that we truly are. It is only in those struggles, in our sometimes hellish attempts to accommodate another human being, and the demands of self-transformation that requires from us, that we become whole. At this level, the novel is about the search for self-fulfillment through relationship.The second register of the novel is the register of pre-personal desire. For Lawrence, our desires are bigger than our egos. Our desires often drive us beyond ourselves towards things that scare us. Our desires often feel threatening to our self-identity and what we take to be our fixed personalities. The hero for Lawrence is the person who is willing to follow their desires into the unknown as opposed to walling themselves up in a secure life. Our desires lead us to self-transformations that are often scary and painful and disillusioning but they provide the only path to a genuinely fulfilling life. There is a moral tradition dating back at least as far as Plato and moving all the way up to Freud that teaches us that desire is blind and needs to be restrained. The Id is limitless and will destroy civilization if it is not reigned in. Lawrence believes that desire is fundamentally religious. Desire is fundamentally a desire for the unknown and the transcendent. From Freud's perspective, the Id needs to be restrained because it has a tendency to make life for the ego very uncomfortable. Desire is the problem and the ego is the solution (""Where 'It' was, there 'I' shall be""). For Lawrence, it is the ego that is the problem. The ego is what chains us to our little selves and chains desire to the ego's own self-aggrandizing projects. The Rainbow is a celebration of desire as a liberating and religious force that is able to break down and free us from our egos.The third register of the novel is the metaphysical or religious register. Lawrence has a fully worked out metaphysics in this novel that is fundamentally religious. Every character in the novel is driven by a desire for the unknown. Some of the characters find fulfillment in another person. That person comes to represent the unknown - or, we might say, the infinite, for them. Other characters - like Ursula - are unable to find what they are looking for in another person and their search continues. There are at least two aspects to Lawrence's metaphysics. First, the fundamental drive that is driving human beings - and the Universe as a whole - is a religious drive, it is a drive that calls people towards self-transformation and self-realization. Lawrence actually has a fairly optimistic view of human nature. In Lawrence's universe something like evil would simply be a very confused and mistaken attempt at self-realization. The desire itself is good and wholesome but it is directed into a misguided channel. The second aspect of Lawrence's metaphysics is: the world exceeds what can be known of it. Our little islands of consciousness are surrounded by infinite darkness and our desires will never be satisfied with anything less than infinity.My description of the novel no doubt makes it sound much more abstract than it really is. This is definitely a philosophical novel, but it is a novel, not a philosophical treatise. The main interest lies in the characters, their emotional struggles, their conflicts with other characters, and their attempts to find a life that can satisfy the longings that define them. There are so many beautiful and poignant moments in the novel that will break the reader's heart. I was particularly moved by the scene with little Anna yelling at the geese, ""My name is Anna, Anna Lensky, and I live here, because Mr. Brangwen's my father now. He is, yes he is. And I live here."" There is a very interesting metaphysics behind the novel but it is ultimately a human story. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R264R55A8TQ9NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451530306#wasThisHelpful","R264R55A8TQ9NS","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent collection of critical essays on an excellent novel. I am going to try to provide brief summaries of the essays in this volume for the interested reader.""Introduction"" by Mark Kinkead-WeekesMark Kinkead-Weekes places Lawrence's novel in the context of Lawrence's own artistic development, the development of the novel, as well as its broader historical context, and highlights some of the major themes of the novel. In terms of Lawrence's development, the novel lies between the agonizing struggle that gave birth to Sons and Lovers and the apocalyptic post-war Women in Love. It is like a beautiful landscape or valley between two mountains.In terms of historical context, the novel deals with three major changes taking place in England between 1840 and the first years of the twentieth-century: the industrial revolution, a revolution in education leading to an increase in articulateness, knowledge, and self-awareness, and the decline of religious values (5) Lawrence avoids falling into simplistic extremes: either the ideology of triumphalism and infinite progress or the parochial nostalgia for a lost past. Lawrence sees the opportunities, the dangers, and the new challenges of the new historical developments.Lawrence is also part of the movement in literature from ""behavior"" to ""consciousness"". According to Kinkead-Weekes, Lawrence's challenge is to ""discover new ways of showing the lines of force which operate"" on his characters, ""to make them reveal first one orientation, then another, according to the rhythm of the situation in which they find themselves, while remaining recognizably the same people"" (8)""The Originality of The Rainbow"" by Marvin MudrickMarvin Mudrick argues against those readers who would see the originality of Lawerence's novel in his rejection of the stable ego and his new form of characterization. Rather, what is original to Lawrence, and The Rainbow in particular, is that ""it is the first English novel to record the normality and significance of physical passion; and it is the only English novel to record…the social revolution whereby Western man lost his sense of community…and men - more especially, women - learned…that there is no help any longer except in the individual and his capacity for a passional life"" (17)""The First and Second Generation"" by H.M. DaleskiH.M. Daleski analyzes the struggles in the marriages of Tom and Lydia and Will and Anna. Lydia represents the unknown for Tom which he both desires and fears and the conflict between them is only resolved when he finally stops trying to conquer the unknown and instead surrenders to it. There is a dialectic of losing and finding the self at work in their relationship. The relationship between Will and Anna is different. Will is dependent on Anna - he sacrifices his own creative self when he destroys his woodcarving - while Anna wants to remain independent.Daleski provides a very interesting analysis of the scene between Will and Anna in the Cathedral. It is tempting to view Will's rapturous ecstasy as positive and mystical but it is a oneness without difference, a return to the womb, to the lack of differentiation. Anna recognizes this when she clings to the ""sly little faces"" and gargoyles that ""laughed in triumph of their own very littleness"". There is a lot that is left out of the Cathedral: the individual in their freedom and littleness (54-55)""The Third Generation"" by Keith SagarKeith Sagar analyzes Ursula's struggle. Ursula's struggle is different because her ""struggle against the confines of her life"" takes place before marriage rather than within marriage. She demands a lot from life, and she is consistently disillusioned, but this does not lead to cynicism or conformity. Rather, ""If life seems to thwart her, it must be that she has sought the wrong things; rather than ask for less, she will ask even more of it"" (58) She is searching for the unknown in her relationship with Skrebensky but she does not find it. Nor does she simply resign herself to its loss to settle down within the comfortable limits of a life with Skrebensky.""The Rainbow and the Bible"" by George H. FordFord argues that Lawrence - like Joyce - was dissatisfied with the ""one-dimensional  level of naturalistic fiction"" and combined modes: ironic, mythic, romantic, and epic. Ursula - like Leopold Bloom - is, on the prosaic level, a young woman living at a particular time in England, concerned about her future, love, career, historical change, but, on the mythic level, through the use of Biblical references Lawrence also portrays her as a prophetess who can lead us out of the wilderness to the Promised Land - just as Joyce portrays Bloom as another Ulysses (76)Anna Brangwen, her mother, beams a forerunner. She begins a journey into ""unknown realities"" but stops on ""Pisgah mount, from whence she can see the rainbow, a symbol of promise"" (76). She is no longer a ""traveller surging forward"" but she is devoted to her daughter who will continue the journey into the unknown. This mythic dimension of the novel adds a sense of timelessness to a novel that is very historically situated. Just like Joyce situating Ulysses on a specific day, but highlighting universal themes through the mythic parallels with The Odyssey, Ford argues Lawrence is doing the same thing by using the Bible.""The Childhood of Ursula"" by William WalshWalsh argues that Ursula's childhood is determined by Will's over-possessive love for her. There is some unfulfilled need in Will, and a need to be recognized and affirmed, which he turns to Ursula to fulfill. The roles between child and father are reversed because Will's love is dependent and Ursula's is protective (85) As a result ""the relaxed rhythm of childhood is shattered, and the child…is jerked too early into a too sharpened awareness"" (85)Another quality of Will's love is its exclusive character ""which inspires in the child a corresponding jealousy and resentment for anyone outside the magic alliance who attempts to break into it"" (86) This is an important element in Ursula's character and inspires in her a kind of instinctive fear of the ""grudging power of the mob"" since she is an exception. She always feigns to be less than she is ""for fear that her undiscovered self should be seen, pounced upon, attacked by the brutish resentment of the commonplace, the average Self"" (88)Walsh also examines the devastating effect that Will's unprovoked acts of cruelty have on Ursula and how they help to determine her future character. Walsh rightly praises Lawrence for his ability to portray a familiar domestic event ""like a father's anger with his child"" in a way that makes us feel ""the vibrations of a deep and complex human disaster"" (87)""Lawerence's 'Carbon'"" by Laurence LernerLerner's essay is quite short, and it is quite clear it is part of a larger context which is left out, which makes it a little difficult to discern Lerner's point. Lerner argues that Lawrence is concerned with ""carbon"" but, unfortunately, what Lerner means by ""carbon"" must have been developed in a part of his book that was not included in this selection.Lerner praises Lawrence's ability to outdo the realists by conveying a realistic scene as well as the unconscious processes and tensions that are going on behind the scenes. This has something to do with what he means by ""carbon"" but I am not entirely sure what.""The Marble and the Statue"" by Mark Kinkead-WeekesKinkead-Weekes's essay opens with a number of great quotes from letters that Lawrence wrote describing his writing of The Rainbow. Here is one of my favorites:""The Laocoon writing and shrieking have gone from my new work, and I think there is a bit of stillness, like the wide, still, unseeing eyes of a Venus of Melos…There is something in the Greek sculpture that any soul is hungry for - something of the eternal stillness that lies under all movement, under all life, like a source, incorruptible and inexhaustible. It is deeper than all change, and struggling. So long I have acknowledged only the struggle, the stream, the change. And now I begin to feel something of the source, the great impersonal which never changes and out of which all change comes"" (97-98)Kinkead-Weekes also examines early drafts of The Rainbow when it was still titled The Sisters or The Weddning Ring. He provides an analysis of Lawrence's study of Thomas Hardy and its theology based on the dialectic of Law and Love and Female and Male which Lawrence sees operating everywhere and, Kinkead-Weekes argues, is the true subject of the novel. Kinkead-Weeks provides an in depth analysis of three scenes from the novel - the cathedral scene with Anna and Will, the new relationship of pure lust between Anna and Will that results from Will's experience with the warehouse girl in Nottingham, and the scene of Ursula with the horses - in terms of the dialectic from the Hardy essay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S4114R25VJRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0137526830#wasThisHelpful","R3S4114R25VJRJ","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard H. Brodhead has collected a solid set of essays on Moby-Dick that succeeds in examining the novel from various perspectives and increasing the reader's appreciation for Melville's complex novel. I will attempt to provide brief summaries of each essay to give the reader some taste of what they will get from this volume.""Trying All Things: An Introduction to Moby-Dick"" by Richard H. BrodheadIn his introduction Brodhead argues that Melville identifies literature with ""epic, quest narrative, and heroic tragedy"" (2) Melville manages to combine these genres in the figure of Ahab who rises to epic and heroic proportions and manages to ""sum up some fact of human potential"" (2) but ultimately succumbs to a tragic fate. However, Melville does not stay strictly within the limits of traditional epic or tragedy - his writing embraces ""the full form of writing's expressive potential"", all the way from Elizabethan soliloquy, to scientific treatise, to Calvinist sermon, to legal brief (4)Brodhead makes a good point when he argues Melville sees the ""most elemental human passion"" not as ""love, or ambition, or acquisitiveness, but something more like anxiety - anxiety, specifically, about the ground of our being, an anxiety that drives us…to keep worrying the question how the world is framed and governed"" (4) This is ultimately the impelling force of the novel. Ahab and Ishmael are not driven by pure ambition or greed but by a desire to get to the bottom of the mystery of the world.Brodhead also discusses the critical history of Moby-Dick and makes the interesting point that the revival of interest in Moby-Dick came at a time ""When qualities like discontinuous or fragmented form, symbolic structure, stylistic thickness, and antitraditional experiment were established as literary values"" (18) This goes to show that aesthetic standards are not eternal. They are not set in stone. They change through the ages and, as they change, works become reevaluated, and people become capable of appreciating what appeared merely mysterious before.""The Mariner's Multiple Quest"" by James McIntoshMcIntosh highlights the ""fluidity of consciousness"" found in the novel. The novel never presents any settled opinions but is rather driven by an endless seeking and questioning of the universe, there is no settled mood that is not eventually disrupted by its opposite. The novel expresses moments of mystic calm followed by violence. The novel also flirts with relativistic nihilism in its presentation of the different perspectives on ""The Doubloon"" but even nihilism is only a temporary resting place that eventually gives rise to continued seeking.The novel is a Romantic quest narrative, where an external quest becomes the image of an internal quest, but, according to McIntosh, it is unique in being a ""multiple, not a singular, quest"" (29) Each character is on their own unique quest and the White Whale does not signify the same thing to everyone. McIntosh compares and contrasts Queequeg's quest with the quests of Pip, Ahab, Father Mapple, and Captain Bildad.""Moby-Dick as Sacred Text"" Lawrence BuellLawrence Buell points out that the ""rise of the 'higher criticism' in biblical studies"" around the time Melville was writing had two effects. Negatively, the higher criticism threatened to reduce the Bible to a ""culture-bound, historical artifact subject to the same methods of interpretation and susceptible to the same errors…as any other ancient artifact"" (55) Positively, ""a less parochial and more creative understanding of the religious imagination…became possible, an affirmative reading of myth as the expression of spiritual archetypes informing not only the Bible but the scriptures of all cultures, and not only ancient texts but - at least potentially - the literature of one's own day as well"" (56)This new understanding of religious literature, as more akin to poetry, made it possible to conceive of poets as prophets and ""Literature and scripture become interchangeable categories"" (57) Buell argues that Melville's novel is a religious novel that is a part of this new myth-making process.Buell argues there are two elements in Melville's novel that are in tension to some degree. There is often a comic note involved in Melville's religious imagery - for example, in Melville's description of the elephants praying by holding their trunks up to the sun - that undercuts the myth-making process with the possibility of solipsism, since, as Ishmael notes: ""in gazing on such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in"" that determines how they are read (60) But, there is often high seriousness in Melville's myth-making and ""the luminousness with which the mystery of Moby Dick has been invested"" (61) It becomes possible to read Moby-Dick as a comic debunking of myth as fabrication or as a form of sacred scripture. Buell argues the latter reading is more persuasive ""for dramatic reasons"" (64)Buell summarizes briefly Paul Ricouer's analysis of different forms of revelation. Prophetic revelation is based on a double author of speech. The prophet is God's mouthpiece and the words spoken by the prophet are really the words of God. Moby-Dick is not revelation in that sense. Ishmael never claims that God is inspiring the words he writes. However, there is also narrative revelation. What is ""essential to narrative revelation…is the emphasis on the founding event or events as the imprint, mark, or trace of God's acts. Confession takes place through narration…God's mark is in history before speech"" (65) God is present in the events of Moby-Dick and Ishmael merely narrates them as a witness to the divine event.""Call Me Ishmael, or How to Make Double-Talk Speak"" by Carolyn PorterCarolyn Porter provides an excellent analysis of the role that Ishmael plays in Moby-Dick. Ishmael has to play many duel roles in the novel. Ishmael has to be both an outcast and a representative of human nature, he has to occupy the marginal space between the familiar and the unknown, and he has to speak ""with the full authority of the culture whose authority he is out to subvert"" (93) Melville has to walk a very fine line with Ishmael and it is a mark of his genius that he was so successful in creating a character that exists right on the line. If Ishmael veered too far in either direction the novel would become a very different novel.If Ishmael was not an outcast to some degree, if he represented our quotidian selves entirely, we would be presented with a farce. Ishmael would be totally lost and out of place at sea. Perhaps we would see him trying to stick to his morning breakfast routine while the rocking ship knocked the bowls and plates off his table to comic effect. If, on the other hand, Ishmael was totally foreign, he could not represent our own human nature, he would be above and beyond us, or outside of us - like Ahab. Ahab represents a possibility of human nature but he does not represent human nature in its universality, whereas, Ishmael makes the feeling for the ocean seem ""fundamental to human nature itself"" (74)Similarly, if Ishmael was not in some sense a representative of the culture whose authority he was out to subvert, our xenophobic defenses would go up, and Ishmael would seem aggressive, savage, and intolerant. Even though, as Porter argues, Ishmael ""aims to undermine our most basic and fixed assumptions and beliefs"" most readers find Ishmael to be ""genial, tolerant, open-minded"" (93-94) If Ishmael fell too far the other way, and simply represented our own culture, and not its subversion, then we would be presented with a novel about the strangeness and foreignness of other cultures in a way that would merely confirm us in the rightness of our own beliefs.""Calvinist Earthquake: Moby-Dick and Religious Tradition by T. Walter Herbert, Jr.T. Walter Herbert, Jr. sees Moby-Dick as a response to a rift that opened up in the religious landscape in the Nineteenth-century between Orthodox Calvinism and the liberals. The contradiction arises from two claims, 1) That the world is governed by Providence, 2) That God is just and respects the moral integrity of human beings. According to Herbert, Melville ""sets forth a Calvinistic analysis of Ahab's moral strife in order to form a drama in which Calvin's God appears morally odious on liberal principles, yet in which liberal principles lose their validity as a description of religious truth"" (128)Ahab is the representative of this conflict. Ahab sees his injury at the hands of the White Whale as a punishment inflicted by God which he refuses to accept since, the doctrine of a God who punishes the entire human race for Adam's fall is a teaching that evokes ""a divine monster ruthlessly violating the central principles of moral truth"" (127) However, Ahab - and the entire novel - also undercut the liberal notion of a God who respects the moral integrity of humanity. The deist God of order is foreign to the revelation of Godhead - not as a ""decorous city"" but as the ""ground on which the city stands, which reveals its strange hidden life when it moves"" (113) - that underlies the novel.""When is a Painting Most Like a Whale?: Ishmael, Moby-Dick, and the Sublime"" by Bryan WolfBryan Wolf's essay analyzes the notion of the sublime that is at work in Emerson's essay on Nature, Melville's novel, and American landscape painting. Wolf argues that the sublime in all three is not, as is often assumed, a loss of self in the unity of nature but, rather, the absorption of nature within the solipsism of the self. This process takes place through language. However, Melville is very careful to point out the limits and dangers of the sublime in that sense. The sublime is easily disrupted - by a precipitous fall from a mast-head or when Queequeg intrudes - and the result can be death. Those who forget the outside - and forget that writing, or the attempt to recover the world in speech, relies on an outside that can never be fully absorbed - risk falling to their death in their moment of ecstasy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HIKN6J8UWZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521317886#wasThisHelpful","R5HIKN6J8UWZI","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to do something I do not usually do in reviews and break this review into a list of what I consider to be its strengths and weaknesses. This list may be somewhat idiosyncratic but I will balance that by saying upfront: overall I thought this book did a very good job providing a basic introduction to the themes of Salinger's novel, the character of Holden Caulfield, and some of the debates that have surrounded the novel since its publication. In other words, the ""weaknesses"" I will list - which are colored by my own interests and subjective opinions about the novel - should not be taken as arguments against reading this book. I heartily recommend Pinsker's book to anyone who is looking for a deeper appreciation of Salinger's novel.Both the strengths and the weaknesses of the book revolve around Pinsker's analysis of the character of Holden Caulfield. This is hardly a surprise since the novel itself revolves around Holden Caulfield. If I had to summarize the strengths of the book in a sentence I would say: Pinsker often succeeds in presenting Holden as a much more complex character than most readers often assume. It frustrates me that the critical landscape around Salinger's novel seems divided between the ""Holden lovers"" - who think Holden is the most insightful genius who ever walked the earth - and ""Holden haters"" - who think Holden is just a spoiled brat, a pseudo-intellectual cynic with nothing positive to offer in the place of all he would like to destroy. I do not think that either camp has much appreciation for Holden as a character or the emotional struggles of a teenager drowning in despair. Instead, both sides focus on Holden's ""philosophy"" and miss the emotional core of the novel. The weakness of Pinsker's book is that he sometimes gets caught up in trying to figure out what we should think of Holden's ""philosophy"" as opposed to trying to understand him as a character. The strengths of Pinsker's analysis definitely outweigh the weaknesses, however, since any book that is able to increase the reader's appreciation for Holden as a complex character - and not simply the mouthpiece of teenage angst or a half-baked philosophy - is a definite step in the right direction.So, first the strengths. Pinsker does a good job getting at the existential core of Holden's struggles. People who read the novel often fail to see the existential problems that give rise to Holden's ""philosophy"". The ""Holden haters"" criticize Holden's philosophy without understanding the emotional turmoil that lies behind it which is the real subject of the book. Pinsker argues that The Catcher in the Rye is a death haunted novel. When Holden asks the cab driver what happens to the ducks during the winter Pinsker argues it is a ""thinly veiled way of asking the question 'Who protects life?'"" (38) Holden is at the age when he is becoming more aware of the world around him, and he has to face the fact that no one seems to be in charge of protecting the weak from the storms and fury of the world - no one is in charge of making sure the ducks survive the winter - and this effects Holden very deeply. Holden's attack on ""phoniness"" is a result of the force with which such existential questions assail him. Holden wants to be comforted and his disdain for people is often a result of their inability to offer him anything but cliches and platitudes. For example, Holden is critical of the undertaker who comes to his school and talks about Jesus being his ""buddy"". He knows that having Jesus as a ""buddy"" is not a solution to the deep existential problems that trouble his soul. This is what the ""Holden haters"" universally miss. They take Holden's philosophy, and his disdain for nearly everyone, at face value, and fail to see what lies behind it.Most readers are able to understand on a first read through of the book that Holden is fascinated by childhood and has a deep longing for the lost innocence of childhood. However, many readers miss Holden's equally powerful desire to become an adult. It is the conflicting desires that create the real difficulty of Holden's situation and Pinsker does a good job analyzing this. Holden's desire to be an adult shows up in the scene with the woman on the train where he attempts to act more adult and sophisticated than he really is. It is a simplification of Holden's existential dilemma to assume that he is simply fighting against the inevitability of growing up. If that were his problem he could simply remain infantile and hide from the adult world. There are people who choose that path in life and are able to avoid falling into the kind of existential struggles that Holden falls into. But that is not a solution for Holden because Holden's existential dilemma is a result of being pulled in two directions at once. That is what makes his experience so wrenching and difficult.Finally, to conclude my list of strengths, Pinsker recognizes that there is growth in Holden. This is something that I missed - and I think a lot of readers miss. Critics of the novel argue that Holden is critical of everything around him but has nothing positive to offer. I think that criticism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the novel - and, more importantly, a misunderstanding of life, as if the solutions to life's problems required the working out of some ""positive philosophy"". Most of the existential problems human beings struggle with are solved by living through them, outgrowing them and accepting them. We do not necessarily have to have some positive doctrine to offer at the end of the process. The solution to Holden's existential struggles does not lie in the elaboration of some grand metaphysical system capable of answering his question about the ducks in winter - or justifying the ways of God to man. Holden never offers us a theologically satisfying analysis of Providence to allay our existential worries about the fragility and precariousness of life. Nor does he bury his head in the sand of naive optimism and pretend that everything is okay with the world. Many of the people Holden meets attempt to offer him solutions along one or another of those lines but Holden recognizes the emptiness of any attempt to solve life's problems with a philosophy, a new car, a good career, or by becoming buddies with Jesus.Holden does grow up though. When Holden is watching his sister Phoebe go around the carousel at the end of the novel he has an almost epiphanic insight that is easy to miss. Phoebe and the other kids are all grasping for the gold ring on the carousel and it is dangerous. Holden would like to protect them but he recognizes he has to let go of his desire to be a ""catcher in the rye"", he has to let go of his desire to protect everyone from the cruelties of the world, and, as Pinsker argues, ""Part of the sheer joy,"" Holden experiences in the final scene of the novel, ""is a newly quiet acceptance (partly born of exhaustion, partly of relief) of the human condition as it is, and must be"" (94) I think it would be a sin against this epiphanic insight to try to present it as a positive doctrine. If Holden were to attempt to present his new acceptance as a new philosophy of life it would falsify the experience. The world is still a cruel place, there is no one watching out for the ducks. People are still stupid and mean and trapped in meaningless pursuits that they hope will silence the anxiety and despair at the core of their being. All of that is still true about the world but Holden has a new perspective on it all. He even begins to miss Stradlater and Maurice. Perhaps, Holden realizes that everyone is caught up in the same drama and our stupidity is the result of our efforts to find some livable solution to the insecurity we feel. He might not be able to articulate that but that does not justify the criticism that Holden has nothing positive to offer.Now the only weakness of Pinsker's books is: Pinsker sometimes fails to treat Holden as the complex character that he is and starts to offer his own commentary on Holden's philosophy. For example, Pinsker is critical of Holden's views on artistic purity. Holden thinks anyone who works in the movies has sold their soul and he thinks that the piano player at the bar is just playing to the crowd by throwing in a bunch of cheap tricks. I do not necessarily disagree with Pinsker's ""critiques"", rather, I disagree with the whole approach. Salinger did not write a work of philosophy or aesthetics or cultural criticism. He wrote a novel. And the protagonist of the novel is a teenage kid. We would never think of criticizing The Sound and the Fury because Quentin's views about female sexuality are misguided. Rather, we praise Faulkner for creating an interesting and tortured character. Too much of the criticism surrounding The Catcher in the Rye is a result of abstracting Holden's philosophy and dealing with it in abstraction from the emotional core of the novel and the struggles of its central character. People treat Holden as if he were an unfiltered mouthpiece for Salinger's own philosophy and believe they are criticizing the novel when they are really criticizing what they take to be Salinger's philosophy.Pinsker never goes to that extreme, but he does, in places, seem to feel it is necessary to critique some of Holden's views. But the question of the literary critic is not: are the views elaborated by character X correct in some Platonic heaven of true ideas? Rather, the question is: are the ideas true to the character the novelist was trying to create? Does the author succeed in create a believable and full-blooded character with an understandable point of view? Does the novelist succeed in portraying the emotional and existential struggles of their main character in a powerful and compelling way? and other similar questions. Salinger, I think, does a great job portraying the existential struggles of a confused kid, and Salinger never pretends that Holden is anything other than a confused kid. If Salinger had wanted to portray Holden as a prophet with all the answers, he could have, but he did not. We turn Holden into something he was never meant to be when we start debating his ideas about ""artistic purity"" or ""aesthetics"" as if he were a professor who had just published a treatise on the subject. Holden's views on ""artistic purity"" are not meant to be a fully developed philosophy of art. They are the expression of Holden's longing for something true and genuine. In that sense, they express an emotional truth. Whether they are true in any other sense is irrelevant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131236E1IYOH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805779787#wasThisHelpful","R131236E1IYOH9","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually take detailed notes when I read books and write really long reviews based on my detailed notes. However, I am getting lazy and I did not take any notes when I read this book. It felt like too much work. I think it is still worth writing a review because this is a really solid analysis of Moby-Dick and deserves at least one review. However, in contrast to most of my reviews, this one is going to be short and sweet. McSweeney does a great job analyzing the themes and characters of Moby-Dick. Moby-Dick is a difficult book. It is full of digressions, it gets deep into the intricacies of the whaling industry in the Nineteenth century and uses obscure nautical and whaling terms that most readers will be entirely unfamiliar with, it mixes genres, it can seem sloppy at times - adopting various narrative points of view - and the long middle section of the book is pretty short on plot and action. Many people find it a bit of a slog to get through. While I enjoyed most of Moby-Dick I admit that I found it a slog in places.McSweeney does a good job conveying why people continue to read Moby-Dick, and find it endlessly fascinating, despite its surface difficulty. McSweeney sees the primary theme of the book as the ""quest for what Ishmael calls 'the ungraspable phantom of life', 'that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts' the predominant embodiment of which in the novel is Moby Dick itself…This quest involves profound explorations of fundamental epistemological, psychological, and metaphysical questions: what if anything can be known with certainty? can meaning or significance be found in the world outside the self or even in personal experience? do human beings have free will or free choice and if not who or what shapes human destiny? what is 'the secret of paternity' that makes us what we are? is there an afterlife or at least something beyond the visible world other than 'inscrutable malice' or a blank whiteness signifying only 'the heartless voids and immensities of the universe'? is there an abiding alternative to the suicidal impulses or self-destructive obsessions that come in the wake of 'the knowledge of the demonism of the world'? how adequate are Christian beliefs in the face of such knowledge and what is the status of the transporting but fragile experiences of friendship and love, and of oneness with the visible world?"" (9)McSweeney really dives into the metaphysics of the novel. What I found most powerful in the novel was Melville's refusal to resolve the metaphysical questions raised by the novel. The unknown part of the world always exceeds the known part and it is our existential condition to be a tiny light encompassed by darkness. The whale symbolizes that in the novel. It is important to remember that, at the time Melville wrote the novel, most people had never seen a whale. Now we have nature shows on television so, even people who have never been to the ocean generally know what whales look like, and can get some idea of their size, and learn about their life. When Melville was writing people only had drawings and paintings to go by and Melville spends a chapter of Moby-Dick analyzing all the inaccuracies commonly found in depictions of whales in the Nineteenth-century. Even scientists knew very little about the subterranean life of whales so they were a perfect symbol for the vast reaches of the unknown. McSweeney does a great job highlighting this theme in the novel.McSweeney also does a great job analyzing the characters of the novel and their differing worldviews. He focuses in particular on Ishmael, Ahab, Starbuck, and Stubb. They each represent a particular relationship to life and the world. Stubb represents a kind of unthinking confidence in the world, Starbuck represents the standard Christian viewpoint, Ahab is the monomaniacal obsessive, and Ishmael - whose viewpoint is perhaps too complex to summarize in a sentence - represents the questing spirit, the search for the ""ungraspable phantom of life"", and a soul that is acquainted with the vast reaches of the unknown, and the sad and dark aspects of the world, that are left out of Stubb and Starbuck's worldviews. Ahab and Ishmael are similar in many ways but McSweeney does a good job highlighting their differences as well. McSweeney definitely increased my appreciation for the complexity of Ishmael as a character and narrator. In fact, it is the narrative voice of Ishmael that first drew me into the novel and my interest in Ishmael as a narrator, and a character - McSweeney is careful to distinguish between Ishmael the narrator, who looks back on his experiences, from Ishmael the character in the described action of the book - has only grown after reading McSweeney's book.There is much more in McSweeney's book than I have been able to summarize since I am basing this review purely on memory and my memory is not what it used to be. But hopefully this review will give potential readers some idea of what they will find in this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W29IWM567LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805780025#wasThisHelpful","R2W29IWM567LE","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a lot of the books in the Twayne Masterworks series. They are almost always of a very high quality and this is definitely one of the best I have read. It provides a fascinating analysis of Beckett's play Waiting for Godot and increased my appreciation for the play a great deal. This is going to be a long review, mainly because I want to summarize all the insights contained in this work for selfish reasons, so that I can return to this review and remind myself of Cousineau's insights whenever I want. I hope other people get something out of the review as well.All of the Twayne Masterworks start out with three chapters that analyze the historical context, the importance, and the critical reception of the work under review. In the chapter on historical context Thomas Cousineau reads Beckett's play in the context of the attempts to convey ""moments of intense perception that free the self from its bondage to ordinary consciousness"" made by Joyce and the Surrealists and also discusses Beckett's play in relation to Artaud's theory of the theater and his claim that the ""concrete scenic language"" of a play could convey meanings which addressed themselves directly to the prerational self without the mediation of language. This becomes a major theme of Cousineau's reading of Beckett. He does not merely analyze the words of the play but the stage directions as well which, Cousineau argues, often convey their own direct meaning which is in contrast to the nihilistic hopelessness that is expressed through the overt speech of the play.In the chapter on the importance of the work Cousineau discusses some of Beckett's innovations in the theater which include his ""refusal to subscribe to the conventions of plot, his exploration of new structural principles, such as the use of repetition and difference, and his foregrounding verbal games and non sequitur rather than 'meaningful' dialogue"" (7). Cousineau also argues that the play critiques ""patriarchal society"" which favors abstract perception over sensual perception. Freud, in Moses and Monotheism argues that this was a ""great step forward…because it permitted those progressive achievements through which man was able to extend his mastery over the world."" However, for Becket, it was also a move that alienated us from the ""creative well-springs of life."" Cousineau argues that the play dramatizes this conflict in the relationship between the text of the play - which expresses despair - and the concrete movements and gestures of the play - which convey humor and even joy.In the chapter on critical reception Cousineau argues that there are two main lines of interpretation. The first group of interpretations focus on theme, meaning and symbolism but, Cousineau argues, Becket himself warned against reading the play in terms of ""meaning"" and ""symbolism"" - reading ""Godot"" as ""God"" based on their linguistic similarity, for example, a connection that does not actually work in French which is the language the play was originally written in. Beckett claimed that the ""key to the play was the literal relations among its surface features"" (11). The second group of interpretations take Beckett's claim about the ""literal relations among"" the play's ""surface features"" seriously and focus on structural elements - repetition, etc. - choreography, and internal dynamics. I think Cousineau favors this second approach to the play but, readers who enjoy thematic and symbolic analyses - and I count myself among that group - will still find discussions of those aspects of the play in Cousineau's book.In the rest of my review I am just going to summarize some of the insights that I found most interesting in Cousineau's analysis of the play. If I had to sum up Cousineau's interpretation - and reveal the common thread that runs through all of these insights - it would be this: there is a tension in the play between the overt text, which expresses a message of meaninglessness and despair, and the concrete action of the play - which includes the verbal games that are freed from the dominance of meaning - which are humorous and express a kind of primal joy in life. That tension expresses the fact that the meanings we impose on the world, and our attempts to order the world in an effort to control the future, are imposed by the ego. We cling to those meanings, and we think life would be unlivable without those meanings but, in reality, those meanings are a burden that robs life of its spontaneous joy. In other words, I think Cousineau's analysis is based on the intimate relationship between the destruction of meaning and the release of instinctual joy.In the introduction Cousineau does a great job describing what I will call the subterranean effects of Beckett's play. This is not a term that Cosineau uses but I think it captures what he is getting at. Cousineau points out that Beckett takes Descartes's method of radical doubt to extremes undreamt of by Descartes himself. Everything falls under the negativity of doubt but ""His negativity does not…leave us with feelings of desolation and abandonment…This is because we intuitively recognize that the beliefs and foundations undermined by Godot exact a heavy price in terms of instinctual renunciation"" (22) Despite the overt despair that is expressed in the text of the play, one does not come away from the play feeling beat down. The play is quite humorous and ""The fact that we enjoy being relieved of these inherited structures seems confirmed by the laughter that the play provokes"" (22)Beckett destroys the beliefs that have sustained us but ""after destroying every conceivable foundation, proposes alternative forms that have little connection with our conscious wishes. Our enjoyment of Godot, in spite of its discouraging portrayal of human aspiration, may imply the existence of potentialities that refuse the narrow structures of conscious desire and seek expression in the fulness of the present rather than in a perpetually deferred future"" (24) It is possible that Beckett is critiquing a particular relation to time: waiting for something that never arrives. We are attached to our hope for the future but it also brings us agony. It is the boredom of waiting so, once we are relieved of that structure, we can find the ""creative well-springs of life"" in the present moment. I have always felt a real sense of relief whenever I see a Beckett play or read his novels and I think Cousineau does a good job explaining why.Cousineau argues that it is tempting to read the play in terms of its Christian symbolism - the tree, waiting expectantly, etc. - but the play could also be pointing out our ""cultural inertia"" and our tendency to interpret everything in terms of our own cultural inertia. Then the ""pedagogical value"" of the play would lie ""not in its positive use of Christian myth as a means of interpreting the world but in its capacity for making us self-consciously critical of our own readiness to make interpretations in terms of inherited points of reference"" (27) In other words, it would be pointing up the arbitrary nature of the meanings we impose on things. We see ""waiting for Godot"" as ""waiting for God"", not because of ""objective evidence"" within the play, but because we are looking for those meanings already, even if we are not Christian. But, perhaps, the whole conceptual framework - even if emptied of theological content - is arbitrary and meaningless.Cousineau argues that Beckett's fundamental insight is that ""our relationship to the world is based on a misunderstanding…we assume that our individual selves are the center of the universe"" but ""the truth of the matter is that the universe, having no need of us whatsoever, acts in accordance with principles that are completely indifferent to our individual needs and aspirations"" (27) Christianity obscures this truth because it puts man back at the center. It is often argued that without a goal - in the form of the Kingdom of God, or a meaning imposed on history by Providence - the world becomes meaningless. Our conscious minds might grasp at external meanings but I think there is a deeper level of ourselves that is actually relieved to be free of such meanings and free to find joy in the present moment that is not connected to some hazy future. It is a burden to be the center of the universe and I think we feel relief at a bodily level when we are freed from such notions. I think this is what Cousineau means when he says that our beliefs exact a heavy price in terms of instinctual renunciation.Cousineau makes these points when he argues that Vladimir and Estragon ""live in a world that has been molded by the Christian hope of salvation"" (28) It is a particular relation to time. Time is empty and meaningless now but it is going to be fulfilled and meaningful. It makes us ignore the present moment. This structure is deeper than Christian belief ""Even if the foundations of Christianity were to be dealt a deathblow, its vision would assume transplanted form within some secular ideology because the promise of an outcome that ultimately justifies the accumulated frustrations of a lifetime is simply too seductive an illusion to give up"" (29) The play dramatizes ""the degradation that the Christian promise of salvation can encourage"" (30)Cousineau returns to the theme of the subterranean effects of the play - the meaning that is conveyed to our body rather than our rational consciousness - when he discusses the use of language in the play. Cousineau points out that while the ""words spoken by characters often fail to communicate thoughts, they do supply the raw material for a series of verbal games that we instinctively enjoy…Moreover, when language does fulfill its communicative function in Godot, it frequently serves as an instrument of oppression and alienation. The intelligibility of a statement is often directly proportional to its success in manipulating a character's behavior. The playful use of words, on the contrary, deprives language of its coercive power, transforming it into an expression not of authority but of liberated impulses"" (43) If there is a continuing thread through Cosineau's analysis I think it is that meaning is often oppressive. Beckett celebrates a meaningless world but, far from being a depressing view of life, the freedom from meaning is really a celebration of the immediacy of life, sensuous experience, and play.The play, for Cousineau, is not structured by a traditional plot. In the beginning of the play Vladimir and Estragon are waiting for Godot, there is an interlude with Pozzo and Lucky, and then Vladimir and Estragon go back to waiting for Godot. The arrival of Pozzo and Lucky, and their departure, has no effect on what Vladimir and Estragon are doing (54-55). The play is structured by Vladimir and Estragon's enslavement to a very unreliable past. They do not remember clearly what they asked Godot or what he promised or what they are waiting for but they sacrifice the present moment to an unlikely future based on a very hazy memory. Vladimir and Estragon are enslaved to a dead mythology and the promise of a kingdom that never comes so they are unable to create new futures. Cousineaus makes the same point I made above - about meaning being oppressive - when he argues that this structure of memory and expectation and the ordering of the world in terms of cause and effect are impositions of the ego. They are ways the ego attempts to remain master of the world and its own experience - by predicting the future based upon the past. But, it is only ""after the ego has been dethroned"" that the ""smothered divinity of unconscious experience"" can awaken (65).Cousineau provides a beautiful analysis of Vladimir's speech, ""Was I sleeping, while the others suffered?"" Cosineau argues that, ""The hypnotic quality of the speech, created by its poetic imagery and cadences, reinforces our sense that this is a moment of heightened awareness"" (74). Anyone who sees, or even reads the play, can tell immediately that the rhythm of the language has changed and, as Cosineau says, this conveys in a very immediate way that Vladimir has reached new depths of himself - he has broken through the surface consciousness created by habit, which dulls our experience and ""cuts us off from the deepest layers of feeling and revelation at the same time that it defends us against the suffering of others, who only too clearly perceive our sleep and self-deception"" (74).Cousineau also provides an interesting analysis of the use of repetition and difference in the play as structuring elements. This is a different way of structuring our lived temporality. Expectation for the future is one way of living time but repeating difference is another. The first way of living time posits a goal that lies beyond the present moment in a future that never arrives but the second finds depth and fulfillment within the present. This reminds me of Gilles Deleuze's analysis of the eternal return which undermines any telos to time and instead connects us with the prerational depths of the present. The characters in Beckett's play are constantly weary because they live in the first kind of time where time is just waiting and boredom. I think this is what Beckett means when he says that the play is not symbolic. We do not need to equate Godot with God. The important thing is in the experience of waiting itself - as a way of living temporality - and that is all on the surface of the play.So, those are the insights in Cousineaus book I found most interesting. I highly recommend this work to anyone who would like to increase their appreciation and enjoyment of Beckett's play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IZS5CHSBSG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805780246#wasThisHelpful","R11IZS5CHSBSG6","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nietzsche is a philosopher with many faces and he has been appropriated by interpreters with wildly different and often conflicting goals. For example, he has been enlisted by philosophers of a Romantic persuasion in their attacks on science. Such interpreters draw on Nietzsche's analysis of the ""will to truth"", his celebration of art and appearance, his perspectivism, and his ideas about the fictional nature of all posited unities - such as that of atoms. But he has also been enlisted by the scientifically minded in their attack on superstition, religion, and philosophical systems built on a priori premises. Nietzsche has been appropriated by both philosophers and non-philosophers who are looking for justifications for their amoral behavior, and find that justification in a particular interpretation of the will to power and Nietzsche's attacks on pity. Nietzsche has also been appropriated by those seeking a new, naturalistic ground for ethics and values. As evidenced by the reviews on this site, Nietzsche has been appropriated by harsh critics of liberalism and the values of liberalism - such as individualism - as well as staunch individualists and celebrators of ""diversity"".Every philosopher leaves some wiggle room for competing interpretations but this seems to be especially true of Nietzsche. The Nietzsche you get depends a great deal on the interpreter. As Alexander Nehamas points out in his Foreword to the new edition of Kaufmann's Nietzsche, ""Kaufmann's book brought about a radical reversal of the popular image of Nietzsche as a ranting, totalitarian, anti-Semite and gradually made it possible for philosophers...to take him seriously once again"" (v). This makes Kaufmann's book historically important. However, Kaufmann was so successful in destroying the image of Nietzsche as a ""ranting anti-Semite"" that one might ask: is Kaufmann's book still relevant? If all Kaufmann did was debunk the myth of Nietzsche as a proto-Nazi this book would be of merely historical interest. However, Kaufmann's interpretation of Nietzsche is both interesting and still cuts against the grain of many modern interpretations of Nietzsche.So, what picture of Nietzsche do we get from Kaufmann in this book? Kaufmann is particularly eager to debunk the myth of Nietzsche as a Dionysian reveler, a celebrator of chaos, a defender of the unbridled passions against anything - or anyone - that would seek to place a check on those passions. This view is still a very popular view of Nietzsche and is often espoused by philosophers who have been influenced by Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche. I happen to love Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche, and I think it is more subtle than what I have presented above, but there is no doubt that Deleuze celebrates the Dionysian side of Nietzsche. Kaufmann argues that Nietzsche had a more nuanced view of the Dionysian as early as The Birth of Tragedy - what he was really celebrating in that book was the union of the Apollonian and Dionysian in Greek tragedy, not the Dionysian in distinction from the Apollonian. Kaufmann also argues that the Dionysian eventually came to represent for Nietzsche the dialectical union between the Dionysian and the Apollonian, as opposed to only one term of the dialectic.Kaufmann is equally eager to debunk the notion of Nietzsche as an irrationalist Romantic. Kaufmann sees Nietzsche as an empirical/experimental philosopher and a rationalist. According to Kaufmann, Nietzsche attacked systems - and Christianity - mainly because they were based on first premises that were supposed to be a priori and beyond question - or based on unquestioned faith. Nietzsche wanted all premises to be subjected to experimental evaluation. Nothing was beyond question. Kant is an illuminating example. Nietzsche often attacked Kant and his notion of the categorical imperative. Readers of Nietzsche who are interested in giving free reign to their passions and selfish impulses often take Nietzsche's attack to be an attack on morality or law tout court. But, if we accept Kaufmann's reading, what Nietzsche was really attacking was Kant's failure to question the origin of the values he took for granted. He simply took the moral principles of his own time and culture as unquestioned and based them on the eternal nature of Reason. Nietzsche wanted to submit even our most cherished values to experiment and rational critique.Kaufmann's study is presented in chronological order. Kaufmann believes that many misinterpretations of Nietzsche result from the fact that interpreters pay too little attention to the development of Nietzsche's thought. So, Kaufmann begins with the early books - The Birth of Tragedy, Untimely Meditations, Human, All Too Human - and moves all the way through Ecce Homo and The Antichrist. This is an illuminating way to progress. We can see, for example, how the notion of the will to power grows out of Nietzsche's desire to provide a naturalistic ground for values and morality (at least in Kaufmann's interpretation). The metaphysics of The Birth of Tragedy was still dualistic, the Apollonian was viewed as a separate force from the Dionysian. The taming force of civilization was anti-naturalistic. The will to power solves this problem. It is a naturalistic force as well as being a fundamental drive towards self-overcoming. There is no need to introduce a second force since the fundamental drive of life itself is self-overcoming.Kaufmann interprets Nietzsche's famous doctrine of the Overman in terms of his interpretation of the will to power. The Overman ""has overcome his animal nature, organized the chaos of his passions, sublimated his impulses and given style to his character"" (316). We can see how far we are, in this interpretation, from the celebration of Nietzsche as the Dionysian reveler. For Deleuze, for example, the Overman is the one who affirms the eternal recurrence of difference by affirming chaos against all imposed identities - including the identity of the subject. For Kaufmann, the Overman is the opposite: he is an orderer of chaos, a person who is able to ""become themselves"" by giving shape to their own character. Kaufmann holds Goethe up as Nietzsche's primary example of the Overman in that sense.Alas, I do not have time - or the inclination - to summarize all of Kaufmann's book. Kaufmann does have some very interesting things to say on the Eternal Recurrence, Nietzsche's repudiation of Christ, and his admiration for Socrates, but I will let the interested reader discover that on their own. I do not always agree with Kaufmann's interpretations but he definitely presents an interesting perspective on Nietzsche. I also think it is still a necessary perspective since there are so many simplistic interpretations of Nietzsche floating around. There are very few people who still interpret Nietzsche as a proto-Nazi, but there are still people who interpret Nietzsche as an amoral celebrator of unbridled passion and the drive for power, or as a teenage angst-ridden attacker of ""the herd"", and as long as those people are around Kaufmann's book will serve as a necessary corrective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRKJ4GVYOHC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691160260#wasThisHelpful","R1RRKJ4GVYOHC0","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Haugeland's book begins with an hypothesis: human thought is at bottom ""rational symbol manipulation."" This is a contentious thesis but Haugeland does not present it dogmatically. Haugeland's book presents a narrative history of AI and the attempts that have been made to build realistic computers that are capable of mimicking human thought by manipulating symbols. The book is broken up into topics but Haugeland also manages to present a lot of the history and context which is good for neophytes like me.John Haugeland's book has a number of virtues that make it a good introduction to classical AI. First, its accessibility. I have a strong background in philosophy, but I have almost no background in philosophy of mind, computer science, or cognitive science. Even without that background I found the ideas presented in this book to be both lucid and powerful. The chapter that examines computer architecture was the most challenging but Haugeland still manages to present the ideas clearly.Second, Haugeland is honest about the serious difficulties that classical AI runs into when trying to produce realistic models of human thought. However, as I realized very quickly reading this book, even the failures of classical AI are illuminating. We learn a great deal about human thought by examining the ways in which computers fail to realistically mimic our thought. By seeing what computers are (at the present moment) incapable of doing we get some insight into what we are capable of doing. I think human thought progresses by following paths to their natural conclusion and, even when we reach dead ends, we have learned something about why that path was a dead end. So, I think it is great that there are people taking the basic hypthothesis that human thought is rational symbol manipulation as far as it will go. Even if the version of AI presented in this book turns out to be a dead end we will know more about why it is a dead end if we pursue it to the end. If we simply dismiss it on a priori grounds we gain nothing.Third, Haugeland himself is not dogmatic one way or the other, which is extremely refreshing. He clearly finds the prospect of AI exciting but he does not consider it inevitable. He sees the problems and challenges clearly and he does not hide them from the reader or adopt a defensive posture. It is easy to dismiss the idea of AI, but the easy dismissal of AI is generally based on our intuitive understanding of how our thought functions, and our intuitions are often wrong. One of the great things about AI research is that it often presents us with really startling, counter-intuitive hypotheses about how our minds function. And finally, Haugeland never pretends we know more than we do and he leaves the reader with lots of unsolved problems begging for thought and future research (which is a good thing).All in all, if you are looking for a good, accessible, exciting introduction to classical AI, Haugeland's book is a great place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QYZBOPWIPM2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262580950#wasThisHelpful","R2QYZBOPWIPM2V","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It causes me real pain to have to give this book three stars and in all honesty I was on the fence between three and four. There are lots of really beautiful and lyrical passages in this novel and the novel is certainly powerful. It is, I think, a novel about being sunk in our own karma. It is a meditation on death and the infinite aspirations we all carry trapped in the prison of our rotting mortality. I was often enthralled by McCarthy's prose and the images he creates - I was especially moved by the image of a helix of moths coiling up to a light only to fall burnt to the ground - and I have a great deal of sympathy for McCarthy's worldview (despite what my review may lead you to believe).However, I found reading this book quite tedious most of the time. I have a lot of complaints with the novel. Some of my complaints have to do with what I take to be McCarthy's ""metaphysics"" and some have to do with more technical aspects of the novel. This is going to be a long review because I want to be detailed about what I did not like about this book. I know a lot of McCarthy fans (and I consider myself a McCarthy fan) are going to disagree with my assessment of this novel but I hope at the end no one will wonder why I did not like this book more than I did.I will start with some of the technical aspects of the novel that made reading this book tedious. The main problem I had with the novel is that it seemed to me to be mostly atmosphere. McCarthy spends pages and pages ""setting the scene"", so to speak, but nothing much happens in the novel. To use an analogy, imagine a playwright who spent all of his time designing the set, getting the atmosphere just right, and then realized he did not have time to actually write a script, so he just let his characters wander around for awhile in the beautiful set, and called that a play. That is how this novel feels to me. McCarthy did a great job creating his set but then he just lets his characters wander through it for awhile and calls that a novel. He even has some interesting characters (more on that later) and he occasionally has them do interesting things (especially Harrogate) but the focus is not right.He makes what should be the background (the atmosphere) the foreground and what should be the foreground (the plot) the background. The plot seems incidental to McCarthy's real interest: the decay of the material world, which McCarthy never tires of describing. His  obsession with rot and decay eventually becomes monotonous and boring. Whether he is describing a field, the woods, the river, or the streets of Knoxville, McCarthy always picks out the same exact details: litter, ripped newspaper, weeds, rusting metal of some kind, feces, and usually an animal carcass, and all of his adjectives refer to decay or rot. The book reads in places like a long list of objects that McCarthy finds distasteful or like a list of evidence in a trial against God (Exhibit A: What about animal feces, your honor? Pretty disgusting, right? Well, it exists in the world YOU created, Lord! What do you have to say about that?).To make matters worse, what plot there is McCarthy manages to confuse in a number of ways. First, he has a whole host of characters with strange names (J-Bone, Cabbage, Hoghead), or sometimes he just refers to them as ""junkman"" or ""blindman"", but he does not do a good enough job introducing or individuating them, so the reader never has a very clear idea of who is who. Plus, when McCarthy has dialogue with his characters he often does not label who is speaking. He apparently does not want to clutter up the page but dialogue is one of the best ways to reveal  and individuate character. We often learn what people are like by the way they talk so, by not labeling the dialogue, it makes the characters even more shadowy and amorphous.There are only a few really clear characters in the book: Suttree, of course, Gene Harrogate (who is, by far, the most interesting character in the book), and Ab Jones (and a few others whose names are escaping me). The rest of the characters never really stand out well enough against the background. That can be a problem and detracts from the potential power of some of the scenes. For example, late in the book Suttree picks up a paper and reads that ""Hoghead"" is dead (403). This could potentially be a powerful scene if the reader can remember who Hoghead is. By that point in the novel I certainly did not remember who Hoghead was.Gene Harrogate is the one real success of the novel (other than the novel's lyricism). He is the most interesting character and he has the most interesting story arc, if you can call it that. He is simple in a lot of ways, our first sight of him involves the violation of watermelons, but he is quite clever in a lot of ways as well. He figures out a way to kill bats that inspires a doctor's admiration and he is always working on some get rich quick scheme. He is funny, interesting, and he has an interesting story. I wish he was in the book more. There are huge sections where he does not appear at all and the reader feels his absence. I kept wanting the story to get back to him.Suttree is not, in my opinion, a similar success as a character. McCarthy shares with Hemingway an aversion to the inner lives of his characters. He only portrays inner lives through outer action and it is partly for that reason that Suttree feels like a blank screen to me. He registers everything around him but it is not clear what he wants or what he is doing or feeling. We know that he has had some falling out with his family but we never really learn what it is. He goes and sees an aunt in an insane asylum late in the book and I kept thinking, ""Alright, we are going to get some revelation"" but, instead, we get a very convoluted genealogy crammed into a couple of paragraphs and that is it.Hemingway also had what he called an ""iceberg theory"". Hemingway believed you could leave anything out of a story, as long as the author knew it was there, and the reader would feel it. However, it was important that the author know what he was leaving out, otherwise, it was just an excuse to be lazy. McCarthy presents the reader with the tip of the iceberg: Suttree's uncle visits him early in the novel and they discuss his family in an oblique way, his mother visits him in prison, he is chased away from his son's funeral by his wife and their family, etc.. You know something else is there, but I don't think that even McCarthy knew what else was there, and the reader feels that. The reader can feel that there is no wizard behind the curtain.I also do not feel like I really felt the emotions of the characters in the novel. McCarthy does a good job conveying disgust in the reader, and the self-disgust of his characters, but he is not as good at conveying their sadness, or even their despair. When Suttree's son dies he is clearly very sad but the reader does not feel it. I had actual tears in my eyes when I read The Road. McCarthy was successful at conveying genuine sadness in that book but I did not feel it in this one.The same goes for the character's despair which feels too intellectual. Characters say they want to die and that they are tired of life, but again, I did not feel it. It felt like the kind of despair that arises when a philosopher contemplates the world (as a former philosophy student I know all about that). Chekhov wrote a story about a man imprisoned in an insane asylum (I might not have those details exactly right). The despair in Chekhov's story was so intense it made me want to jump out of my skin. It was crushing. I never felt that in this novel. I never felt the character's hopelessness. They often expressed it in words but I did not feel it.Now, I will say a word about the metaphysics of the novel. I think all of our aesthetic judgments are tied up with judgments about what we think is true. So, it is impossible to separate our aesthetic judgments from our judgments about what the world is at a fundamental level. I would never characterize myself as an optimist. There are times when I am afraid to reflect on the world because I feel myself pulled towards what the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche called an ""incurable pessimism"". I tend to be drawn toward writers who have a bleak view of life, I like to read authors whose work answers to the dark questionings that consume my own soul.However, McCarthy takes pessimism to a whole new level in this novel. I felt like I was being beat over the head with it. I felt like saying something I don't think I have ever said to another human being ""Cheer up McCarthy! Things aren't so bad!""I think McCarthy has the sensibility of a lapsed Catholic. I am Catholic myself. At least, I was baptized Catholic. My own feelings about Catholicism are quite complicated and an amazon review is not the place to air them. However, I recognize a sensibility in McCarthy that I also recognize in myself. Catholics often have sort of a bleak view of the world and the pleasures of the flesh. This surfaces in McCarthy's views on the physical world (his most common adjectives refer to decay, rotting, etc.) and sex (McCarthy describes the activities in a brothel as ""brief ruts spent...in the joyless dark"").In that latter description, we see that, for McCarthy, there is no joy in human sexuality. It is compulsion. However, in the ""full"" Catholic view there is also the ""good news"" of Christ's redemption. In the light of Christ's redemption we can say, with the Catholic monk Thomas Merton (who I believe was quoting William Blake) ""Everything that is, is holy."" McCarthy keeps all the pessimism but without the good news. He even says explicitly in the novel ""no news is good"", and I take that to be a reference to Christianity.And just so I am not misunderstood, I am not attacking McCarthy for rejecting Christianity (I know nothing about McCarthy's actual religious views). I am simply pointing to a sensibility that I think pervades this book (and probably all of McCarthy's work): he has accepted all of the most depressing and pessimistic aspects of Christianity and discarded the rest, at least when he is constructing his novelistic world. He has rejected the notion of heaven as a vain illusion but he still believes in the existence of hell. All of his characters still strive for some kind of redemption but they are not allowed to believe in it or hope for it. At one point Suttree is standing in a lightning storm ""It cracked and boomed about and he pointed out the darkened heart within him and cried for light.""This is a character who is crying out for some kind of redemption but he never gets any kind of a vision of anything beyond his own miserable life. The closest he comes to a vision is when he is lying on his bed staring at ""the light in the ceiling thirty feet above like some dim nebula viewed from the pit."" In some novels, this might have been a vision of an ""otherworldly beauty"", perhaps unattainable, but still a promise of something beyond the world. But, in this case, he is simply staring at an artificial light in a run down building. There is nothing of promise in the description.SPOILER ALERT. The end of the book is, surprisingly, not utterly hopeless. There is an image of a white concrete highway that suggests something like a passage into an afterlife, though it curves into empty air with iron rods pointing into vectors of nowhere. But at least Suttree is leaving Knoxville. There is a sense that he is pulling himself out of the mire of his own karma (if, in fact, he is still alive, and I think there is some reason to doubt that). The hounds of hell have not managed to snatch him, at least. But the vision of the white highway is ultimately unconvincing and fails to convey a sense of otherworldly beauty or resolution (compare the scene to Honda's walk into the garden at the end of Mishima's The Decay of the Angel and you will see what I mean).I think McCarthy is also a bit of a Romantic, mourning the loss of a childlike vision that has not yet been introduced to the cruel realities of the world. There is a beautiful passage late in the novel that describes two ways of looking at a carnival, ""Suttree wondered if she were ever a child at a fair dazed by the constellations of light and the hurdy-gurdy music of the merrygoround and the raucous call of the barkers. Who saw in all that shoddy world a vision that child's grace knows and never the sweat and the bad teeth and the nameless stains in the sawdust, the flies and the stale delirium and the vacant look of solitaries who go among these garish holdings seeking a thing they could not name"" (408-409).This passage probably encapsulates everything I loved and hated about this novel so I will analyze it in a little detail and then bring this ridiculously long review to a close. First, I think it is a beautiful passage, and captures beautifully a certain vision of the world: as a carnival, full of vacant solitaries, who are seeking for something, but they don't know what. It is a beautiful little encapsulation of the human condition.However, there are lots of different ways of looking at a carnival, as this passage itself makes clear. Children see ""constellations of light"" and throngs of people having fun, celebrating life, while the pessimist sees nothing but bad teeth, nameless stains in the sawdust, and hopeless imbeciles striving toward some unachievable goal. If you were to ask a pessimist to describe a carnival they could no doubt give you a powerful description of the seedy underbelly of carnivals, the cheats, the broken promises, the dirt, the feces. That is essentially what Suttree is. A novel written by someone who looks at the carnival of the world and sees nothing but the dirt, the cheats, the feces, and the shattered hopes.McCarthy seems to think that is the only ""true"" way of looking at a carnival. He feels annihilated by the truth but he is unwilling to comfort himself with an illusion. But what he considers the ""truth"" is merely his thought about the truth. The death that McCarthy is so troubled by in this novel is really the thought of death. Not death itself. It is not nothingness that oppresses us but the thought of nothingness, and it is not death that makes us miserable - how could it? - but the thought that we must die (which, of course, is true). If we could stop clinging to our ideas of being and nothingness we might be able to see the carnival like a child again. But, I think, in this novel at least, McCarthy is too obsessed with his own thoughts about death. He sees the world through tired eyes and, not surprisingly, seeing the world through his eyes eventually becomes tiring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3KWKKVG7NHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679736328#wasThisHelpful","R1D3KWKKVG7NHL","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot to appreciate in The Mayor of Casterbridge. The novel has an interesting plot full of twists and turns and fateful accidents. It is an interesting character study of a man who feels hounded by fate but is ultimately trapped in his own character. It can be viewed as a study in self-destruction, and I also think it is sort of a mournful cry of resignation in the face of an indifferent world, though that might be just my own subjective interpretation.The plot of the novel centers around Michael Henchard and a small cast of supporting characters. The novel opens with Henchard selling his wife and daughter at a fair. The next day he is repentant and swears off drink for twenty one years. A sober Henchard eventually becomes mayor of Casterbridge and his wife and daughter return. I am not going to follow all the twists and turns of the plot but Hardy makes a point to connect the events in the novel, and the unraveling of Henchard's fate, to his character (hence the title of my review)Henchard often feels as if there is a malevolent power operating in the world. There are lots of little accidents that continually undo his plans, but Hardy makes it clear that it is Henchard's decisions and character that rule his fate, and not some malevolent force. Henchard is a tragic character because he is sympathetic in many ways. He is not evil but he has some pretty serious ""tragic flaws"". He is impulsive and he has a temper. He is constantly moving from relative tenderness, to rage, to vengeance, to repentance before beginning the cycle all over again.The novel, I think, is about how hard it is to escape from ourselves. Henchard recognizes that his drinking has gotten him into trouble in the past and he manages to give that up (for awhile, at least) but he is unable to master his impulsiveness or his temper. The sadness of the novel comes from our sympathy for Henchard. When he is not in the clutches of his rage, he can be tender and loving. The occasional tenderness he shows Elizabeth-Jane is touching but it is punctuated by seemingly unprovoked cruelty. It can be frustrating for the reader because we can see Henchard sabotaging himself, and destroying what human sympathy he has, with his rash overreactions. It is like watching a family member self-destruct.It is always easy to look at someone's life from the outside and say ""Well, why did you this, or this, or this? If you had just done this different things would have worked out."" But we all know how hard it is to change our own characters. We follow them even to destruction. Hardy has a melancholy view of the world that is quite explicit, where happiness is ""but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain"", and I think the difficulty of changing our characters, even when we see they are causing us suffering, is at the heart of this melancholy view of the world.I appreciated the way that Hardy portrayed his characters as fluctuating, particularly Henchard. I recently read The Rainbow by D.H. Lawrence and I know one of D.H. Lawerence's innovations was the abandonment of the permanent ego. As human beings we are made up of competing impulses and we are always changing. Hardy portrays brilliantly the struggles of a conflicted character. Henchard is loving at one moment and cruel the next. Our characters are not consistent. They are not simple identities and do not obey the law of non-contradiction.I think Henchard's ultimate ""tragic flaw"" is his rage against fate. In Lawerence, our conflicts with ourselves lead to growth, and we are eventually able to break out of the prisons of our limited egos. Henchard never fully succeeds in breaking out of the prison of his ego but he begins to resign himself to his fate and to the world. He quits fighting against everything and it allows him more space to love the people around him. The image of Henchard carrying his bird cage to Elizabeth-Jane's wedding was quite poignant and sad.Ultimately, I think this is a novel about a very willful person crashing against the world and breaking, and I think the power of the novel comes from the fact that we all recognize ourselves in that description, to some degree at least.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANPYDXV1X7TG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593083092#wasThisHelpful","RANPYDXV1X7TG","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume is a collection of critical essays on Flannery O'Connor's novel Wise Blood. The opening essays analyze the novel from a religious perspective, providing insights into O'Connor's theology and how it effects the world and the characters she creates in the novel. The middle set of essays analyze some of the humor in the book, some of the influences on O'Connor (including Kafka and Dostoevsky), and structural issues. The final set of essays (which, unfortunately, I did not have time to read) examine gender and cultural issues in the novel and discuss the film adaptation of the novel.I found Wise Blood to be somewhat opaque. I knew next to nothing about O'Connor before reading it. I knew she was a Catholic with a reputation for writing brutal books but other than that I knew very little about her theology or her worldview. When I finished the book I was not really sure what I was supposed to make of it. What were we, as readers, supposed to think about characters as strange as Haze and Enoch? Were we supposed to feel hopeful over Haze's ""conversion""? Was it genuine? What about Enoch's ""conversion""?This set of essays helped me get my bearings. I read a lot of literary criticism and the main reason I read it is because it helps me organize my thoughts about a book. Reading literary criticism is like looking for circling vultures in the sky. It lets you know where the meat is. The parts of a novel that critics circle around and debate are often (though, perhaps, not always) the most interesting parts. Even if you disagree with a particular author they they can still help guide you to the meat. Once you are there you can taste it and make up your own mind.I was not blown away by this volume but it definitely helped me find the meat in O'Connor's novel. I am not going to summarize every essay but I want to summarize a couple. The ones I found most interesting. Unfortunately, I got this book from the library and I have already returned it and I did not take the best notes. It is not always clear from my notes whether I was writing down what the author was saying in the essay or the thoughts I had in response to the essay but I will do my best to remain faithful to the authors's intentions in my summaries, and apologize in advance if I accidentally put words in someone's mouth.""Flannery O'Connor and the Question of the Christian Novel"" by Debra L. CumberlandDebra Cumberland attempts to determine ""what kind of a depiction of Christianity and the Christian experience is actually conveyed in the novel"" (5) Debra is ultimately somewhat critical of O'Connor's version of Christianity as portrayed in the novel. For one thing, it is too Manichaean. The material world is evil and the spiritual world is good. Haze draws away from the world into isolation while Enoch plunges into his animal self. There is no reconciliation of the animal and spiritual halves of man. They are split asunder. The material world is ultimately left out of Christ's act of redemption in the novel.This worldview infects the humor in the novel which is bitter, satiric, and full of sarcastic derision (15) It is not ""redemptive humor"".  Cumberland makes a good point ""...'it is impossible to love God and to have contempt for the sins and weaknesses of other people at the same time.' Yet this is exactly what Haze does"" (16) Haze's conversion does not come with a corresponding sense of compassion for the sins and errors of the world. Quite the opposite: it isolates him even further from the world. He has even more contempt for the world in the end than he did in the beginning (if that is possible).Cumberland concludes that Wise Blood does not present a Christian conversion or the act of grace or redemption but it still may be a Christian novel because it portrays a Christian vision of hell (18-19)""Virgil if Punched in the Gut: A Defense of Jansenist Interpretations of Wise Blood"" by Andrew Peter AtkinsonAtkinson begins with a brief introduction to Jansenism as a theological doctrine. Briefly put, Jansenism posits a radical separation between nature and grace with a corresponding devaluation of nature. The novel is Jansenist in theological outlook because Haze does not cooperate with grace. In fact, he actively works against it. He does everything in his power to deny Christ and his redemptive grace but he fails. Grace conquers nature in the end.According to Atkinson, ""What Wise Blood lacks are characters who love virtue for virtue's sake"", i.e. the virtuous pagan (Virgil). If I may be allowed to add my own thought to this: I think this is one of the ways in which O'Connor stacks the deck. She drives the reader toward the necessity for an act of supernatural redemption, and to do so she begins with a description of the world without grace, but her description lacks everything we would recognize as human. It is a world without love, community, morality, friendship, or any other purely ""human"" virtue. She sucks the world dry, presents the shell, and then asks ""Isn't something missing from your supposedly self-contained secular world?""""The Dostoevskyan Structure of Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood"" by Lylas Dayton RommelRommel compares the worldview of O'Connor with that of Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky was Orthodox while O'Connor was, of course, Catholic. This led to differences in their world views. For example, O'Connor's worldview was rooted in the natural law of the Catholic Church. For O'Connor, without the Catholic Church and natural law as guarantees of order the political world descends into chaos. But, for Dostoevsky, ""The idea of equality among individual people based simply on the humanity of each is sufficient to discover moral principles"" (294). This does not require uniformity of belief while for O'Connor uniformity of belief is necessary to avoid chaos.Rommel also highlights the different uses of shame in the two authors. In Dostoevsky, shame ""derives from isolation from human community"", i.e. from a failure to admit your fundamental equality with your fellow human beings. For O'Connor, shames ""derives from participation in a false political system."" Rommel argues that ""shame for a system that allows people to believe and behave however they want pervades the structure of Wise Blood"" (295)Rommel ends with what I think is a great quote so I will present it in full, ""The Christian response to the complexity of the modern world is to see the 'other' as Christ, not to blame him or her...The fear that modern moral choice is really an excuse for nihilism and relativism can be overcome by compassion for the human suffering of blind and limited persons trying to do the best they can under the difficult circumstances of modern life...respect for different perspectives preserves human freedom in ways that O'Connor's argument does not"" (302)You will probably notice a common theme in the essays I chose to highlight. They are all somewhat critical of O'Connor's religious vision. This was, basically, my response to the novel as well. I actually really enjoyed the novel as a novel and I think it had a lot to recommend it. However, I have some fairly profound theological and ideological differences with O'Connor and her novel is saturated in her own theology. It is impossible, I think, to totally separate the novel, considered as a piece of art for aesthetic contemplation, and O'Connor's theology.Actually, I do not believe there is such a thing as ""pure aesthetic contemplation"" divorced from a concern with truth. The things we find beautiful are tied up with judgments about their truth. So, my own analysis of O'Connor's novel is tied up with my appraisal of the ideas contained in it. However, I will say that not all the essays in the book are critical of O'Connor so, if you love O'Connor, and are in general agreement with her theology, I would not let my review deter you from this volume. You will find plenty of food to enjoy and you can spit out the rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41ECEO0AOYTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9042033894#wasThisHelpful","R41ECEO0AOYTU","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rainbow is one of my very favorite novels and Duane Edwards has written an excellent analysis of the novel. Edwards starts out with a very interesting examination of the historical context of the novel. The novel was written around the time of the Great War - a time of great pessimism and great cultural change. It was a time when society was transforming and it became necessary to discover new values. That is one of the great themes of the novel as succeeding generations of the Brangwens have to confront the modern world and create their own religions to sustain them.Edwards also analyzes Lawrence's personal biography and how it influences the novel. One of the most important themes of the novel is the need to grow and adjust in response to our relationships with other human beings - particularly marriage - and the often difficult struggle that ensues when trying to come to terms with another human being. Edwards relates this aspect of the novel to Lawrence's own relationship with Frieda.Edwards also discusses the revolutionary aspects of Lawrence's novel. Lawrence was really doing something very new with The Rainbow. He was discarding the permanent ego. Lawrence believed that our true selves lied in the unconscious, and were always becoming and changing, and he had to find a way to present the unconscious lives of his characters. How, for example, does a writer present the often non-verbal communications that take place, often below the threshold of consciousness, between a man and woman who are married? So much of our communication, and the rising and falling intensities of our lives, are non-verbal so, how does a writer present the non-verbal in a verbal medium?  This is one problem that confronted Lawrence in writing this novel.In the section on the critical reception of the work Edwards presents a really handy survey of the critical literature on D.H. Lawrence and The Rainbow. All of these Twayne series are organized in the same way, and I have read quite a few of them, and the section on critical reception is usually quite short and focuses mainly on the shifting opinions of a work throughout its history. What Edwards does is provide a list of the major works that have been written about Lawrence, summarizes them briefly, and shows how different critics have focused on different aspects of Lawrence's work, and how interpretations have shifted through time. Anyone who loves Lawrence will love this section because they will get to add a bunch of books to their ""to read list"".Edwards also presents some of the philosophical views that Lawrence held and that inform his fiction. For example, he briefly discusses Lawrence's study of Thomas Hardy, and his rejection of Hardy's pessimism, and Edwards makes the very interesting observation that, for Lawrence, the study of man's deepest motives ""does not result in a denigration of man; rather, it reveals that man's deepest motives are religious or creative"" (20). Most modern novels that explicitly - or implicitly - set out to probe the unconscious, and to get at the deep roots of human behavior, wind up taking a rather pessimistic view of human nature.It seems like most modern novelists assume that any dive into the unconscious is going to reveal all the worsts aspects of ourselves - all of our sexual obsessions and aggression that we usually hide behind carefully constructed masks. This is a very Freudian view (and probably a Christian view as well). The things that we repress are repressed because they are socially and morally unacceptable so, if we go exploring in the dark reaches of ourselves, we are bound to find monsters.Of course, it would be a hopelessly rosy view to deny that we do find these things in our unconscious but, for Lawrence anyways, when we probe all the way down, to the deepest roots of our lives, what we find is a fundamental urge for growth, a joy in creativity and in life, a search for fulfillment, and a desire to love and be loved (perhaps even a desire to worship?). I think this is actually a much more realistic view of human nature - we often assume for some reason that the more pessimistic view is the more realistic - and it is one of the things I love about Lawrence, so I was glad that Edwards highlighted it. If I may be permitted a final sidenote on this issue: even Freudian analysis, which in some ways has a fairly pessimistic view of human nature, relies on the creative urge towards health in order to be effective.The rest of Edwards book provides a detailed analysis of the novel through an analysis of the main characters and their relationships and desires. I will not provide a detailed summary of the rest of the book. I highly recommend that anyone who loves The Rainbow read Edwards's book for all of the insights scattered throughout the rest of the volume. I will just say this: Edwards sees the book as fundamentally about Ursula. Her story certainly takes up the largest portion of the book and, Edwards argues, the history of her family provides the context, all the shaping influences, that molded Ursula's character. It is a way of showing the dependence, but also the freedom, of Ursula in relation to her past.Because Edwards views the novel as fundamentally about Ursula he sees a progression in the book. The novel becomes a progression from ""surety"" to a loss of surety and the search for a resolution. The earlier couples in the novel still have surety. Tom and Lydia have a more successful relationship than Anna and Will precisely because they still have surety. The process of accommodation between Tom and Lydia becomes an open war with Anna and Will. It is up to Ursula to successfully solve the problem left unsolved by Anna and Will.I admit, when I first read the novel this is not how I read it. I read it as purposely repetitive rather than progressive. Each generation's struggle is the same as the last generation. Each generation must solve their problems for themselves and each couple comes to their own form of accommodation in the end. I still like my own reading but I was glad to have Edwards present another perspective on the novel that is probably closer to Lawrence's intentions. All in all, I thought this was a very thought-provoking and substantive look at one of the most beautiful novels written in the twentieth-century (or any century).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQAIAFPGBP7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805794018#wasThisHelpful","R3KQAIAFPGBP7Z","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beowulf is a medieval epic poem about a hero who comes from the land of the Geats (modern Sweden) to a Danish hall in order to kill the monster Grendel who has been wreaking havoc there. The poem follows Beowulf's exploits in killing Grendel and his mother, the celebrations in the halls of the Danes, a few old stories as digressions that give some of the history of the Danes, and Beowulf's death at the hands of a dragon.The poem is an heroic epic that celebrates the exploits of Beowulf, similar to the stories told about Achilles and the Greek heroes that eventually became The Iliad, but there is a melancholy atmosphere in Beowulf that, to me, contrasts sharply with the Greek heroic stories. There is always a sense of ultimate destruction looming in the future. For example, when the poet is describing the Danes hall in the very beginning of the poem his admiration is mixed with a forecast of the future, ""The hall towered/its gables wide and high and awaiting/a barbarous burning"" (lines 81-83).The sense of tragedy does not only lie in the future but the past as well. There is lengthy interlude regarding Hildeburh and a fight between the Danes and Jutes (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong) in which Hildeburh is tragically caught in the middle of a fight that claims the lives of her son and brother. The sense of melancholy in the poem is so strong that Tolkien categorizes the poem as an elegy rather than an epic poem.There has been a lot of argument over whether Beowulf is a Christian or pagan poem. There is no doubt that the poem takes place in pagan times. The characters in the poem are not Christian though they seem to be monotheists and the poet presents them as virtuous pagans to be admired. Thomas D. Hill argues, in his essay in this volume, that the poem is a ""radical synthesis of pagan and Christian history"" and that the poet imagines his pagan heroes as saved. When Beowulf's grandfather Hrethel dies the poet writes ""Heartsore, wearied he turned away/from life's joys, chose God's light/and departed"" (2468-69)The poet definitely seems to be suggesting that Hrethel has joined God in heaven. However, what I find most interesting about this passage, and the poem in its entirety, is that, even though there is definitely a strong Christian strain in it, the mood of the poem is not one of Christian hope, or the celebration of Christ's victory over death. Death is a melancholy absolute in the poem. Even in the line about Hrethel ""choosing God's light"" we feel more melancholy about his ""turning away from life's joys"" than we feel glad over the prospect of his blissful afterlife.It is possible I am projecting a purely subjective interpretation on the poem but, what I find interesting in the poem, is the dual sense that earthly life is a veil of tears - where the earthly powers of greed and avarice and violence and death hold sway (which is certainly Christian) - combined with this deep sense of sadness over having to leave the world and ""life's joys""- even with a heavenly home awaiting. I think this is one reason the poem is still moving today. To sum it up in a very trite formula: life is difficult and painful from beginning to end but we very much hate to leave.Now just a brief word on the essays in this volume (I cannot really comment on Heaney's translation much since it is the only translation I have read and I cannot read Old English to compare it to the original). The essays are certainly interesting and many of them are quite helpful in providing insights into the themes of the poem, its meaning, its historical context, etc. However, many of the essays are really (I think) geared more towards scholars. Many of the essays, instead of explicating the poem for the new reader, pick a scholarly position and spend their time defending it, often without referencing the actual poem much at all.I realize that is what scholars do, especially with an historical poem like Beowulf, but for non-scholars like myself, who are really just looking for an increased appreciation of the poem, I would have preferred more essays that analyzed the poem and its themes rather than arguing a very specific thesis that I am too uninformed to form much of an opinion about. The stand out essays for me were Tolkien's essay ""Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"", John Leyerle's essay ""The Interlace Structure of Beowulf"", Jane Chance's essay ""The Structural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grendel's Mother"", and ""The Tomb of Beowulf"" by Fred C. Robinson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EC1PJ348QE0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393975800#wasThisHelpful","R2EC1PJ348QE0D","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really beautiful novella and I don't think there is any way I am going to be able to do it any kind of justice in a review. I am a philosophy student, and I tend to read a lot of philosophical novels, and then I sometimes write very long reviews (some might say too long) discussing the ideas that I find interesting in novels. I don't think there are a lot of ideas in this novel but there is a lot of heart and lyricism and sadness. It is the kind of novel that will stay with you long after you read it.The novel follows a man named Robert Grainier. He works as a logger off and on and he marries and tries to start a family. It is a simple story but it is told in beautiful prose. Johnson manages to be lyrical without being overly ornate or drawing too much attention to his large vocabulary. I consider that quite an accomplishment. The novel is full of genuinely poignant moments. Grainier traveling through the scorched earth after the forest fire, his relationship with his dog, and his penchant for howling.It is a very earthy novel. The characters are all very in touch with the earth. Some might call them simple but they are supremely human and Johnson portrays them with the utmost love and sympathy. Grainier himself does not have any real grand ambitions. He just wants the basics: food, shelter and love. He is also a bit superstitious (he believes the bad things that happen to him are the result of a curse placed upon him by a Chinese man he and a group of railroad workers tried to throw off a bridge).The novel is about a very specific place and time but it also manages to be a universal howling cry of sadness in the face of all the struggles we face as human beings (death, grief, labor, sexual desire, etc.). I am not sure what else I can say about the novel other than: I think you should probably read it. You will enjoy it more than this review. I promise (I know, I am not setting the bar real high there).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8G32CY59IVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250007658#wasThisHelpful","RN8G32CY59IVW","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched this movie right after I finished reading the novel by Jim Thompson (when I say right after I mean minutes after). The movie is quite faithful to the book. I spotted very few deviations from the book and the movie actually helped to clarify a number of plot points I was vague about after reading the book. If you have read the book, and you enjoyed it, I recommend watching the movie. I think they did a good job adapting it for the screen and all the acting seemed excellent to me.The movie is quite disturbing (more disturbing than the book which I thought was lighter in tone). The book it is based on is a first person narration told from the point of view of a serial killer. The story follows a small town deputy sheriff who suffers from a sickness which we usually call sociopathy or psychopathy. He has kept it under control for years until a new prostitute shows up in town that awakes the demon. The narrator does not really have any redeeming moral qualities. People who think that books or movies - or art in general - should have a moral purpose or at least confirm our standard moral values will probably find this movie rather despicable.However, anyone looking to this movie for moral education is looking in the wrong place. Lou Ford is not being held up as a hero in this film or someone to emulate and it is quite clear that no one is endorsing the kind of behavior that is being portrayed in the film. I would also point out that, unlike most shoot em' up movies made today, the violence in this movie is actually hard to watch, which is what violence should be! I think more damage is done by movies that portray violence as ""exciting"" and ""fun"" than by movies like this that portray violence as genuinely horrifying.There are two really horrific scenes in this movie and they are shot as they should be: with very little embellishment. It is just bare. There is no fancy choreography, no crashing through windows, no flying kicks, no dramatic music (that I remember). There is nothing cool, slick, romantic or exciting about it. When you are watching Lou beat Joyce, or Amy lying twitching on the floor in a puddle of her own urine, you just want it to end. You get to see how sickening that kind of violence really is. Which is why I think some of the moral criticisms of this movie miss the mark. It is a brutal movie but it does not romanticize that brutality which I found refreshing.There were a few things I did not like about the movie. I thought the pacing seemed weird in some places but, all in all, I thought the filmmakers did a good job adapting a strange and disturbing novel into a strange and disturbing movie. Although you will definitely need to cleanse your palate afterwards. At least I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQU6988UXWXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LVDK48#wasThisHelpful","R1BQU6988UXWXG","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a big genre fiction reader and this is really the first book of ""noir"" I have read. I am somewhat fascinated by the darker dimensions of the human psyche and there was something about a first person narrative told from the point of view of a serial killer that drew me in. There was a lot that I enjoyed, and even admired, about this book, but I cannot say that I was blown away by it. I am not rushing out to read more Jim Thompson.Thompson does a good job creating an interesting sociopath. The tone of the novel, despite its violent subject matter, is actually relatively lighthearted and even humorous in places. The narrator loves to torture the townspeople by spitting endless cliches at them (every cloud has a silver lining, its not the heat but the humidity, etc.) which I found rather humorous. Thompson does not portray the narrator as simply insane. He reasons, he produces rationalizations for his actions, and it is only in the end, when the narrator has a moment of insight into his true motivations, that we come to see that his reasonings were merely masks for his dark impulses.The plot unwinds in a satisfactory way. It is not overly simple or overly complex. There are a number of interlocking pieces that all come together in the end. A lot of the necessary background to the plot is revealed in dialogue which sometimes feels like it is just pure exposition dialogue put in for the benefit of the reader (like the first conversation between Lou and the union leader where Lou recounts his history and the death of his adopted brother). However, all in all it is a well constructed plot and I was especially pleased with the ending. I admit, I did not see the ending coming, but it seemed so obvious once it was revealed that I was amazed I had not seen it coming.I would not rate this book among the best I have ever read but I certainly have no regrets. If you are a fan of noir or are fascinated by the dark reaches of the human mind I recommend giving this book a try (although I am not really sure there is much insight into the psychology of serial killers in the book it still makes for an interesting novel).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DA6EMV81LWCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679733973#wasThisHelpful","R1DA6EMV81LWCX","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have what some might call a prejudice against short books. When I am really interested in a subject I usually want as much depth as possible so I generally gravitate towards long books. A thousand pages to me is an ideal length if the subject is interesting. Eliot Deutsch's book on Advaita Vedanta is definitely on the short side but it is a masterpiece of concision. Deutsch manages to pack the essentials of Advaita Vedanta into just a little over a hundred pages without it feeling dumbed down or overly simplified.Deutsch manages to provide an overview of Vedantan ontology (theory of being), epistemology (theories of knowledge), and ethics (theories of the good) in an accessible style without sacrificing philosophical depth.I first encountered this book years ago when I took a class on Eastern philosophy at community college. It was the first philosophy class I ever took. I eventually went on to get a Masters degree in philosophy (although I did not specialize in Eastern philosophy). I can say from personal experience that this book is great for all levels, no matter where you are in your philosophical education. It worked great as a basic introduction to Advaita Vedanta when I was just starting out in philosophy, before I even knew what terms like ""epistemology"" or ""ontology"" meant, and it has also been a great resource after years of studying philosophy.Lots of books claim to be great for ""lay readers"" and ""scholars"" alike but this book really delivers in that regard. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction to Advaita Vedanta whatever level of philosophical sophistication you happen to be at.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EYNRHMPA1PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0824802713#wasThisHelpful","R10EYNRHMPA1PL","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent collection of essays on William Faulkner's Sanctuary. Rather than provide a general summary I will just summarize the individual essays themselves to give the potential a reader a taste of what they will be getting with this volume. Warning: this is going to be a VERY long review. The essays were very thought provoking.""Introduction"" by J. Douglas CanfieldCanfield provides a good general introduction to Faulkner's novel as well as the various critical approaches and controversies surrounding the novel. Canfield discusses the major changes that Faulkner made between the first and final drafts of the novel, he points to some of the ambiguities of the novel that have led to critical debate and speculation (why does Temple perjure herself?), he draws attention to many of the major themes, including the theme of evil which we all tend to project outward but which, ultimately, exists in all of us, he examines some of the social themes raised by the novel (the proletariat - the bootleggers - and the bourgeoisie - the townspeople), and he concludes with an interesting discussion of Nietzsche's views on tragedy and the role of the Dionysian and Apollonian in the novel.""Crime and Punishment: Sanctuary""  by Olga W. VickeryOlga Vickery provides a very interesting sociological analysis of the novel and makes a number of very interesting points. She argues that there are two societies in the novel with their own social codes. The bootleggers - out at the Old Frenchman place - live by one code, and the townspeople - including the university where Temple goes to school - live by another. There are different languages at work in each, signs have different meanings in the different contexts. Temple's flirtatiousness, for example, is a sign that is read a certain way at the university, among the college boys and town boys, but it is read very differently at the Old Frenchman place. At the Old Frenchman place it is read as an invitation and as license. The violence in the novel arises from the invasion of one society by the other.Vickery points out that both societies were getting along alright until the foreign element intruded. Lee keeps his home relatively violence free until Gowan and Temple introduce a foreign element into the situation.Vickery provides a very interesting analysis of Horace. She points out, correctly, that what ""reduces Horace to a state of shock is the discovery not of evil but of the shoddy foundations of his vision of a moral and rational universe."" Horace is not horrified at the mere existence of evil (Popeye) but the total failure of the institutions of ""the church, the state, and the law"" in the face of evil. They wind up participating in it. She also points out that Horace is concerned with abstractions rather than the realities of experience (his idealism is destroyed against the harsh rocks of the reality of experience). Vickery puts this very nicely, ""He [Horace] offers Goodwin the protection of `law, justice, civilization' against the concrete menace of Popeye's gun"" and when attempting to convince Temple to testify he stresses the importance of truth and justice while Miss Reba ""cuts through the abstract verbiage"" and reminds Temple that they are going to hang a human being and Ruby and the baby will be left on their own. Horace lives in an abstraction and he is horrified to learn that in the realities of experience ""'good and evil' do not live in separate compartments.""Vickery points out that both of the ""societies"" in the novel lack something. The ""moral society"" of the town lacks personal virtue. They are concerned with propriety but they are hypocrites who treat Ruby cruelly. The bootlegging society has ""personal virtue"" but they live outside the law. Being a philosophy student, I am reminded of Hegel's vision of moral society. For Hegel, having ""personal virtue"" is not enough (to live by private moral laws); those moral laws needed to have concrete form in society, they needed to be concrete by becoming the actual laws of an actual society. Hegel had a vision of a harmonious moral society. In contrast to Hegel's harmonious vision, Faulkner's vision seems torn between a tragic either/or. You can either give into society, as Narcissa does, and give up your absolute moral vision, or you can live tragically grasping towards an unrealizable ideal, as Horace does.Vickery also points out that Temple and Ruby are parallels of one another. Temple is the ""respectable girl"" who finds herself in the ""underworld"" while Ruby is the ""harlot"" who finds herself in ""respectable society"". Both are invasions and both lead to violence.""William Faulkner's Sanctuary: An Analysis"" by Lawrence S. KubieKubie argues that Faulkner's novel rests on ""unconscious sources"" of anxiety, and the primary unconscious source of anxiety structuring the novel is male anxiety about and fear of impotence in the face of instinctual forces. To give concrete form to this anxiety Kubie imagines a man tied down and forced to watch as his wife is raped. This theme is exemplified both in Popeye's literal impotence and Horace's more symbolic impotence.Kubie does a good job drawing out the nightmare quality of Temple's time at the Old Frenchman place. Kubie compares Temple's experience at the Old Frenchman place to the dreams we have where we run higher and higher but cannot escape a danger or we try to run but we cannot move. Temple is in the underworld or the unconscious at the Old Frenchman place.Kubie also sees the novel as a conflict between our blind instinctual forces and the equally blind vengefulness of an enraged conscience (the Id and Superego). Neither force is rational and the ego (Horace) is torn apart and disillusioned by their interminable struggle, worn out to the point of nihilism. Benbow is the ""weak representative of the much battered `Ego,' that fragment of the personality which is so often ground to pieces in the battle.""""Faulkner's Popeye: The `Other' as Self"" by T.H. AdamowskiAdamowski provides an interesting Sartrean reading of the novel and of Popeye in particular. Adamowski points out that Popeye is often described in terms that make him out to be a representative of mechanical nature - he is described, for example, as ""stamped tin"" - but Adamowski argues that Popeye's seeming indifference is a show he puts on. Popeye is treated as a scientific object in his childhood - his mother is told that he will never be older than he already is - he is treated as a piece of being in-itself, fully transparent to the for-itself consciousness. Popeye is reacting against his past, and against being treated as a transparent object by effecting opacity.Popeye's opacity is an existential project in Sartre's sense. Popeye is not, therefore, the mere product of his environment or his disease. He lives his disease, and his past, in a certain way.Adamowski also points out that we do not have access to the inner life of Popeye (this is his opacity in contrast to the other characters in the book) but we do have access to his free subjectivity and spontaneity in another way: the fear that other characters have in relation to Popeye's unpredictability. We know there is a free subjectivity there because the other characters cannot predict what he will do (mechanical nature is nothing if not predictable). The other characters ""recognize that they may fall prey to the whims of this hidden consciousness that seems organized for destruction.""""Gothicism in Sanctuary:  The Black Pall and the Crap Table"" by David L. FrazierFrazier starts out with what I think is an interesting idea: Faulkner's novel has two strains - the gothic element (the rundown mansion in the woods, the sense of darkness and danger and evil) and the modern/comic (the bootleggers) - and Frazier sees the scene at Red's wake as exemplifying both strains. The ""black pall"" of the funeral represents the Gothic and the ""crap table"" represents the modern. However, Frazier uses this motif to develop a moral reading of the novel that I found disgusting - to put it bluntly.Frazier ultimately sees the novel as a ""general moral condemnation of modern youth."" I suspect this has much more to do with Frazier's own worldview than it does with Faulkner's novel.I think Frazier's moral interpretation is entirely incorrect. For example, he sees Ruby as the ""virtuous Gothic maiden"" and claims that the ""differences between Ruby and the matron are the effects of, and point up, the evils of modern society"" while he sees Temple as ""spiritually rotten."" He essentially treats Ruby's view of Temple as if it were Faulkner's view. Ruby sees Temple as a ""selfish hypocrite who gives nothing for all she receives."" Frazier forgets that Ruby views Temple as a threat and this colors her view. He also forgets that Ruby's perspective is only one perspective in the novel. It is the perspective of a specific individual, from a specific class, on another individual from a different class.So far, I think Frazier is just wrong. However, eventually his interpretation becomes chauvinistic and disgusting. Frazier writes ""Temple was a virgin before the crib, but only technically; she had no virginal attitudes and therefore no purity of mind as armor against evil as had the Gothic damsel. The evil which overcame Temple came in part from within her."" Frazier is, of course, right that Temple does not have a virginal attitude, but he seems to be endorsing the view that women SHOULD have a virginal attitude (i.e. they should not have sexual desires of their own and, if they do, they are ""evil"", which makes women partly responsible for the sexual violence that is inflicted on them). This notion that women should have ""virginal attitudes"" and ""purity of mind"" is precisely the hypocritical view held by the townspeople in the novel and it is precisely the view that Faulkner is attacking!Frazier also claims that Temple was ""not raped, but seduced."" In other words, Temple wanted to be raped (the usual argument made by rapists themselves)! Frazier goes on to argue that ""removed from her father and brothers, her inhibitors, her concupiscence, a result of the corrupting influence of modern society, begins to control her."" Of course, Frazier ignores the fact that Temple was brutally raped and abducted and sees her later ""concupiscence"" as a natural flowering of her natural instincts once she is free from her father and brothers. This is the same male chauvinistic view - without men to protect women their own natural sexuality is liable to run amok - that leads Quentin to suicide in The Sound and the Fury.This leads to one of the most interesting double standards in the essay. Frazier views Popeye as a symbol of the death instinct (his impotence cuts him off from his desire, the sexual instincts and life drives, eros as opposed to thanatos). In ordinary Gothic literature the villain is good except for his evil sexual obsession but, with Popeye, he is evil except his sexual desire for Temple is a life instinct that leads to the ultimate suicide of the death instinct (love conquers death). In other words, Popeye's sexual desire for Temple (which leads him to rape her) is a positive ""life-force"" that ultimately leads to the inner collapse or suicide of the death instinct, but Temple's ordinary sexual desires are ""evil"" and are the effect of ""the corrupting influence of modern society."" What a joke!""William Faulkner's 'Temple of Innocence'"" by Aubrey WilliamsWilliams argues that the ""growth and fructification of the 'seed of sin' within all children is...the major area of human experience explored in the novel."" Williams sees Temple as an exemplification of this truth: that ""the maturing process is inevitably a process of learning about one's own involvement with evil."" Williams also highlights Horace and Popeye's childlike qualities. Horace has lived ""the protected life of a nursery"" and it is in Little Belle that he begins to see the ubiquitous presence of evil even in the appearance of innocence. Popeye is a kind of perpetual child and is also a symbol of evil. As such, he stands for the evil that already dwells in all children. I do not entirely agree with these characterizations or interpretations but I agree that the general theme of the ""seed of sin"" within all human beings is certainly a theme of the novel.Williams also makes the good point that the novel sees man ""as the victim not only of himself, but also as the victim of a world, and pattern of evil, for which he is not fully responsible: man is not only the crucifier, but the crucified."" Williams argues that ""the ultimate shock of the novel is not to be found in the single grotesque episode in which a young girl is raped with a corn-cob. It is to be found in the larger pattern of evil and injustice of which this episode is merely one instance."" I think we could say that what Horace finds so demoralizing is that the rape of Temple is not some weird anomaly in the world. The world is in conspiracy with it just as nature is in conspiracy with Little Belle's sexual dalliances. There is a cosmic dimension to evil in the novel that I think Williams is right to emphasize.""The Pattern of Nightmare in Sanctuary: Miss Reba's Dogs"" by William RosskyRossky draws out the nightmare quality of the novel: the fear infused paralysis and stasis that characterize Temple's time at the Old Frenchman place (Temple is constantly running and getting nowhere, soundless screams, etc.). Rossky suggests that this nightmare quality of the novel can help explain some of the mysteries of the novel. Why doesn't Temple escape into the woods? Why doesn't Horace question Temple in the courtroom? It is because the novel is a kind of nightmare. Rossky believes the image of Miss Reba's dogs cowering beneath the bed is an image of man confronted by the ""universal dream-horror of existence"" which is the latent metaphysics of the novel.""Sanctuary and Frazer's Slain Kings"" by Thomas L. McHaneyMcHaney draws out all the parallels between the imagery of Sanctuary and the rituals described in Frazer's The Golden Bough. There are simply too many parallels to summarize them all in my review but after reading McHaney's essay I am convinced that the parallels were intentional and conscious on Faulkner's part. I will just give one example. In the Eleusinian mysteries described by Frazer there was a ritual of mock copulation. A man would intentionally make himself impotent with hemlock, he would descend to a cavern with a woman, they would engage in mock copulation, and when they returned to the surface the man would hold up an ear of corn which the woman supposedly gave birth to, and which was meant to represent nature's fertility.The parallels with Popeye's impotence, Popeye and Temple's ""mock"" copulation, and the ear of corn held up at the trial, are too striking to be coincidences (plus, we know Faulkner owned The Golden Bough, and there are lots more parallels). McHaney sees the events of the novel as a kind of profanation of the rituals described in The Golden Bough. This represents the death of the old gods and myths. The events of the novel do not symbolize new life and fertility but death.""The Profaned Temple"" by David WilliamsWilliams provides a Jungian reading of the novel that I found very interesting. Williams sees Horace as a rational idealist, a representative of masculine consciousness, who thinks in terms of conceptual dichotomies, and rejects life and fertility because life and fertility are inextricably mixed up with evil, and Horace needs to keep good and evil in separate boxes. He is, in Williams's words, a representative of the ""unattainable desire of the male intellect"" to be ""beyond the female cycle"" of life and death. It is the male principle of consciousness attempting to separate itself from its source in the feminine dark.In fact, all the male characters are representatives of this principle, while Temple is a representative of the ""counter-balancing tendency"" of the ""feminine unconscious"" that ultimately unleashes its retributive vengeance on all the male characters in the book (Horace, who collapses in despair; Popeye, who is hanged for a murder he did not commit; and Lee who is burned to death for a murder he did not commit). There is a kind of Dionysian force that rises to destroy the male principle when it ""pursues too strongly its spiritual independence."" Temple is the unconscious agent of this force in the novel. I am not sure if I entirely agree with identifying Temple with the destructive anima but Williams reading is very interesting.Ultimately, according to Williams, the novel concludes that ""Ephemeral...as gnats and no more than insect-sized, the dependent world of masculine life is conceived as being at the mercy of the dominant and perhaps capricious goddess."" Of course, this flies in the face of the most obvious reading of the novel: Temple is no longer merely the victim of male sexuality (although she is that too since it is the objectification of Temple, the moving of sexuality ""to the head"", that unleashes the counter-balancing tendency) she is also the agent of a kind of divine retribution.""Sanctuary: Style as Vision"" by Arthur F. KinneyI was really looking forward to reading Kinney's essay because I have been looking forward to reading his book: Faulkner's Narrative Poetics, for a long time, and the essay in this volume is an excerpt from that book, but I am not sure I really followed his essay all that well. Perhaps it makes more sense in the context of his book. I am wondering if perhaps they cut too much out of the essay to fit it into this volume (there are ellipses throughout).What I gathered is that Kinney is attempting to draw out structural patterns and parallels in the novel: between the locations in the novel (the Old Frenchman place, Memphis, nad Jefferson) and between the characters (Popeye and Horace, Popeye and Temple, Ruby and Temple, etc.). Seeing how these places and characters are similar and different allows us, as readers, ""constitutive consciousnesses"" to see meaning that is not accessible to the characters themselves in their ""narrative consciousness."" For example, seeing all three places together supplies us ""with a sense of ""unified corruptibility."" We see the same evil everywhere we go.Kinney does make an interesting point about Horace that is not necessarily tied to his structural interpretations (which I do not entirely follow). The reason Horace is disturbed by Temple's narration of her experience is because he is confronted with his own naivete regarding women. He returns home and sees Little Belle's picture in a whole new way after hearing Temple's story. He no longer sees women as merely victims of male sexuality but as sexual beings in their own right.""The Space Between: A Study of Faulkner's Sanctuary"" by George TolesToles also makes some interesting points in his essay but, overall, I found his essay to be rather dense and elliptical. I am not even going to try to summarize the overall intent of the essay, because I am not sure I understand what it is, but I will highlight some of the interesting points Toles makes. Toles argues that the opening paragraphs of the novel employ various methods to both bring us into the scene and keep us at a distance, which is in line with the voyeurism scene of the novel. Faulkner withholds information about his characters which makes the scene and the motivations of his characters opaque. He also breaks up the time line in weird ways (something I thought might have just been bad writing when I first read the novel).Toles also analyzes Faulkner's use of metaphors. The descriptions we get of Popeye are full of tropes and metaphors that bring us closer to Popeye but also keep us at a distance. We do not get any direct sight of what Popeye looks like. We see Popeye through a ""haze of metaphors."" Toles argues that Faulkner is trying to cover the brutal and pulp fiction realities of his story with language and provides us with a reality that is ""in excess of the immediate."" I think this is actually part of the reason I did not like the novel all that well. The style did not seem to match the subject. I just finished reading Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood and her style seemed to me to match the subject perfectly, but Sanctuary is telling a brutal pulp-fiction style story in Faulknerian prose, and it just seemed strange to me. I actually wish that Toles's essay had been less dense because he is discussing stylistic features of the novel that I am quite interested in.Toles also provides an interesting analysis of Faulkner's use of paradox. Faulkner loves paradoxical expressions. Not just in this novel but in all of his writing. Toles argues that these paradoxes point to the ""excluded middle"": the reality that can never be captured by our language and our dichotomous categories. This is the ""space between"" referenced in the title of Toles's essay.""Precarious Sanctuaries: Protection and Exposure in Faulkner's Fiction"" by Philip M. WeinsteinWeinstein's essay is one of the shortest in the book but I also think it is one of the best. Weinstein starts with a quote from Nietzsche regarding our ability to handle the truth. Nietzsche imagines that beings can be distinguished from one another in terms of how much truth they can bear. Weinstein believes that the notion of ""sanctuary"" functions in Faulkner as a kind of necessary illusion, or fiction, that human beings are forced to project onto the world in order to live, because, as Nietzsche says, they cannot bear too much truth, the chaotic nature of reality. Man escapes from Nature as unbridled energy (the Dionysian) into the ordered world of man-made categories (the Apollonian).What I especially appreciated about Weinstein's essay was his interpretation of Temple. Nearly all of the essays I have read on Faulkner's novel view Temple as corrupt in some way. She carries the evil that undoes her within herself. I do not view Temple in this way at all. It seems to me this reading relies on an equation between ""natural sexuality"" and ""evil"". Temple is sexual and vain. She enjoys attention from the opposite sex. She is frivolous. All of that is true, but that hardly makes her ""evil"" in a strong sense. She is an average teenage girl. Teenagers in general are more concerned about themselves than about others and I find it hard to believe that Faulkner intended Temple to be a critique of the ""modern generation.""Weinstein argues that ""The disintegration of Temple Drake is the emotional center of the novel and the locus of its considerable power. In it Faulkner renders the damage that a psyche can undergo."" I could not agree more! Every other reader of the novel seems to see Temple's transformation as the natural maturation or blooming of some latent evil that was always within her and that would have eventually developed even if she had not been brutally raped. Weinstein sees Temple's ""disintegration"" (rightly) as based on the vulnerability and fragility of the psyche. The psyche cannot handle too much disorder or too much trauma without breaking and disorganizing. It is amazing to me that so many readers see Temple's evolution as a natural flowering of evil, as if her brutal rape and abduction were just part of the normal course of nature. Weinstein argues that ""The Temple Drake of the later chapters is not so much immoral as psychically damaged."" Exactly! Weinstein's essay is a necessary corrective, in my opinion, for all of the weird interpretations of Temple's character that I have seen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYF5BJWJF71P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0137912285#wasThisHelpful","RZYF5BJWJF71P","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. You have been warned. This movie has a lot of negative reviews and I have to admit, I was somewhat disappointed with the movie myself. I had very high expectations going in, as I think a lot of people did. Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay certainly generated a lot of interest. I will be the first to admit: this movie failed to live up to the hype, fell far short of Cormac McCarthy's best novels, and it is simply impossible in this case to lay the blame on Hollywood or bad acting. Hollywood is notorious for diluting and ruining genuinely original writing but that is not what happened here. Nearly all of the problems with this movie are problems that can be traced to the script.All that having been said, I think this movie is a lot better than many critics are making it out to be. I think a lot of the complaints that people had with the movie arose from a confusion of genres. People are treating this movie as if it was meant to be a thriller. I saw it described in one review as a ""drug-war"" thriller and in another as ""a meditation on capitalism in the form of a thriller about cocaine trading."" Obviously, the plot of this movie revolves around a lawyer who gets caught up in the drug trafficking trade with disastrous results. But, is that what this movie is about?We learn very little about the specifics of the deal that the counselor (played by Michael Fassbender) has made. We know that he is involved with moving cocaine from Mexico to Chicago and that is about it. We also learn very little about the cartels themselves. We see some low level cartel members involved in the operation of transporting the cocaine in a sewage truck but there is only one scene where we get to see a high-ranking cartel member and he spends his time quoting the Spanish poet Antonio Machado, as opposed to talking about the drug-trade or money (he is most certainly NOT an image of unbridled capitalism; if anything he is an image of death and mortality).What the movie focuses on, and it seems to me nearly all the critics neglect this fact, are the relationships between the counselor and Laura (played by Penelope Cruz) and Reiner (played by Javier Bardem) and Malkina (played by Cameron Diaz). They are the central characters in the film. The plot involving the drug deal is ancillary in this sense: it is an external force that disrupts the relationships in the film. I also do not think the movie is about greed. Reiner makes it very clear that the counselor is not motivated by greed. He tried to appeal to his greed in the past and it did not work. There is only one character who I think is motivated purely by greed and that is Malkina.Ultimately, I think this movie is a movie about grief and the suddenness and inevitability of death. The most powerful scenes in the movie are: the scene where the counselor is talking to the high ranking drug cartel member and trying to make a deal to trade his life for Laura's, and the scene where the counselor receives a dvd from the cartel which, because of the set up by Westray (played by Brad Pitt) earlier in the film, we assume is a video of Laura's murder. The counselor's breakdown when he sees the dvd is extremely powerful and, in it, we are confronted by our own helplessness in the face of death.The theme of our helplessness is precisely why (I think) so many people are disappointed in this movie. They were expecting a ""drug-war"" thriller, a battle between good and evil, but, as Mr. Compson says in The Sound and the Fury (I am paraphrasing): when we wage war against the world and fate, we are not only destined to lose, there is never really even any fight, because there is no one to fight. We have all seen ""drug-war"" thrillers and we have certain expectations. This movie disappoints those expectations which, I think, is a good thing.For example, when Laura is kidnapped by the cartel. Here is the standard story that we have all seen a million times (that might be hyperbole): the cartel calls up the counselor and demands that he make reparations for the money he ""stole"" or his wife will die, they let him talk to his wife on the phone, the counselor vows to rescue her, puts together a scheme, meets some challenges on the way, but ultimately prevails (with lots of explosions, car chases and gun battles in between).Here is what we actually get: the counselor figures out that Laura has been kidnapped because she never shows up at their arranged meeting. No one from the cartel tries to contact him about it. No one from the cartel tries to make any kind of deal with him (the cartel is, in that sense, as inexorable as fate; you cannot negotiate or make bargains with death or god). The counselor reaches out to some friend of his, who puts him in touch with a high-ranking cartel member, they have one fairly short conversation on the phone, the counselor receives a dvd of his wife's murder, and he goes home. There is never even a shred of hope that the counselor might be able to get his wife back.The plot unfolds (or unravels) mechanically from the moment the drug deal goes wrong. It just disintegrates. I can understand why viewers who are used to taut, developing, spiraling plots would be disappointed with a decaying disintegrating plot but, personally, I found it a refreshing change of pace, and, I would have been far more disappointed if Cormac McCarthy had turned in a formulaic plot (one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes, who I generally enjoy, was disappointed that the car chase scene ""lacked suspense"". I have two questions: first, would you really want to watch a lengthy car chase scene written by Cormac McCarthy? Is that the best use of his talents? And second, does anyone still get excited by car chase scenes?)There are also people who complained that the plot is ""confusing"". It is true, Cormac McCarthy does not waste time explaining things to his audience. He lets the audience figure things out for themselves. Personally, I think that is a good thing. I get very frustrated with ""exposition dialogue"" in movies and television, dialogue that states the obvious, or has no purpose other than filling the audience in. The plot of the movie is not really complicated enough to require that anyway. There are really only three moving pieces: the counselor (who is allied with Westray and Reiner), the drug cartel, and Malkina (who works for no one but herself).I give McCarthy credit for writing what I think is a well-crafted, non-formulaic plot, that is emotionally powerful. Still, this is certainly not a perfect movie. It suffers from a number of flaws that I think reviewers have nearly universally picked up on.The first and most obvious problem is the dialogue. The critics of this movie are describing the dialogue as ""pretentious"", ""pompous"", ""pseudo-profound"", and other similar descriptive terms. While I do not necessarily agree with those adjectives (the term ""pretentious"" is almost always misused, and terms like ""pseudo-profound"" are often used when people stare into a deep pool and are disappointed when all they see is their own reflection on the surface) but I agree with the general sentiment. There is some dialogue in this movie that might work in a novel (although I am not even sure about that) but seems very out of place on the screen (""the truth has no temperature""; ""it is like being in love with easeful death"" (a reference to Keats).There is also a lot of dialogue that I think is just wasted. For example, Westray spends a lot of time trying to convince the counselor that the drug cartels are seriously dangerous (""You might think there are things that they are incapable of but you'd be wrong""; ""They will cut out your liver and feed it to their dogs.""). I don't think, in this day and age, anyone but the hopelessly nave needs to be convinced that the drug cartels are dangerous and capable of horrific violence, and the counselor certainly seems worldly enough to grasp the risks of his venture (""Oh, you mean the drug cartel might actually kill me if things go wrong? I had never thought of that!""). It was necessary for Westray to tell the story of the snuff tape to set up the most devastating moment in the movie but all the other time he spends talking about how dangerous the cartel is seems wasted.The second problem I think has to do with the characters. None of them are all that likable, which is actually fine with me. I don't need to like characters but I need them to be interesting. There is one extremely interesting character in the movie: Malkina. The rest are sort of boring. We learn very little about the counselor or what makes him tick (Is he a good lawyer? An idealist? A scumbag who gets criminals out on technicalities?). We learn very little about Laura (Where did she meet the counselor? What does she do for a living? How does she feel about her fiance's involvement in the drug world?). We could say the same thing about all the other characters in the movie, except for Malkina.Malkina is quite a triumph, in my opinion. Cormac McCarthy is often criticized for the lack of female characters in his novels but, in this movie, the most interesting character is a woman. She is cruel, deceptive, cunning, and vicious. The scene where she goes to confession, just to mock the institution, along with the belief in God, is a brilliant little scene. Malkina clearly finds something disturbing about the fact that Laura is religious, it does not fit into her hedonistic, materialistic, nihilistic philosophy. She imagines that the priest must be getting off listening to the women talk about their sins (an attempt to fit religion into her own hedonistic philosophy) so she goes to test it out. Perhaps she imagines that she will be able to convert the priest to her own hedonism or perhaps she just wants her own disillusionment to be confirmed. There is, however, no doubt that without Malkina this movie would have been much less interesting.The movie has a lot of flaws. I do not think there are any living novelists who are better writers than Cormac McCarthy. There are probably some who are just as good, but none who are better. There are certainly lots of screenwriters who are better screenwriters than Cormac McCarthy but, then again, there are even more that are worse!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35NFC8X85C93L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID4IVJ2#wasThisHelpful","R35NFC8X85C93L","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some spoilers in this review. You have been warned.I should begin by saying: I am a huge Faulkner fan. However, I have mixed feelings about this book. This book was Faulkner's most popular book for many years, largely because of its outward accessibility. On its surface, the book is much easier to follow than some of Faulkner's other (and I think, better) books. The book's critical reputation has fluctuated. For awhile, I think, it was considered an artistic failure but it has been rehabilitated somewhat. It is not a bad book but I do not think it can be ranked as high as some of Faulkner's other works (Light in August, The Sound and the Fury, Abaslom, Absalom!, As I Lay Dying). I will begin with what I liked about the book and then explain why I did not like it more than I did.Faulkner manages to create an interesting cast of characters. Popeye is quite terrifying and Faulkner deserves a great deal of credit for creating such a complex and terrifying character. It is not often that we see (in books or television or the movies) a truly terrifying character who is afraid of the dark. Horace is also quite complex. There is a lot to admire about Horace: his idealism and his disgust with the moral hypocrisy that surrounds him, but there is also a lot to criticize: his lust for his step daughter, his own hypocrisy, and his lack of moral courage. Clarence Snopes, as the corrupt politician, is also another great character.There are also characters that you love to hate: Gowan, the ""gentleman"" alcoholic who is responsible for Temple's kidnapping and rape, and Narcissa, Horace's hypocritical sister who is largely responsible for having an innocent man convicted of a crime he didn't commit in an effort to protect her own reputation.Faulkner has also created an interesting and fairly intricate plot. There are a number of individual plots that are all seamlessly interwoven: Horace leaving his wife and stepdaughter, Temple and Gowan's relationship, Temple's rape and kidnapping, Lee and Ruby's marriage, Lee's bootlegging operation, and, of course, Popeye's antics and shenanigans. At the beginning of the novel all of these characters are pursuing their own individual paths and, by the end, their fates are all intertwined. Faulkner does a great job building all of these individual stories to a crescendo so, when you reach the climax, when Temple enters the courtroom, and Horace realizes that his case is lost, you feel as devastated as Horace does.Finally, Faulkner explores a number of very interesting themes in the novel. Ultimately, I think the novel is an attack on the hypocrisies of ""high society"" and Christian morality. Popeye's rape of Temple is, of course, extremely brutal, but Temple is treated just as horribly by the court and the justice system. The district attorney claims that they are going to ""right her wrong"" for her, but they really just use her to turn social opinion against an innocent man, simply because he has sinned against public morality by living with his common law wife. Meanwhile, they let the person who is actually guilty of Temple's rape go free.I think one of the themes of the novel is: ""high society"" is guilty of all the same crimes as ""low society""; they are just less honest about it. They cover it up. In ""high society"" sexuality becomes an elaborate ritual, which allows its members to hide their own impulses from themselves. For example, Temple feels very comfortable getting dressed up and going to a dance with the college boys, or going out on dates with the town boys, but she is terrified at the Old Frenchman place. In both arenas she is surrounded by seething male desire, but at the dances it is hidden behind propriety. Within society's rituals it becomes possible to pretend that we are ""safe""; to pretend that the uncontrollable urges boiling beneath the surface are under our control.There is a kind of Freudian theme here. Civilization requires us to mask our own impulses even from ourselves. While Faulkner is clearly critical of society's hypocrisy, the novel is by no means a celebration of the unrestrained id. While the boys at the dance might be more hypocritical than the men at the Old Frenchman place, it is at the Old Frenchman place that Temple is actually raped. If given the choice, hypocrisy is certainly preferable to rape. However, the town's hypocrisy ultimately leads them to burn an innocent man alive and claim, in the same breath, that they are serving ""justice"". There has to be another way out of this dialectic between repression/hypocrisy and the unbridled id. Neither solution works on its own.So, the novel has interesting characters, an interesting storyline, and explores some interesting themes. The novel does, however, suffer from some flaws. I will merely highlight three. First, Faulkner uses some of his trademark language in this book. Some people find Faulkner's language annoying. I generally find it beautiful and it is one of the things I love about Faulkner. However, Faulkner mixes styles in this book in a way that I don't think works that well. I will use an analogy to describe what I mean. Sometimes I hear a song that I think is a kind of seamless web. All the parts fit together perfectly. It is integrated. I do not hear the guitar, the vocals, the drums and the keyboards all as separate pieces merely thrown together. I just hear one integrated song. Other songs are not integrated and I start to feel like the vocals are just floating on top of the guitar.This novel did not feel like a seamless web to me. The language is not integrated and seems to ""float on the surface"". Absalom, Absalom! has a lot of difficult language but the novel is told in long run on sentences that are meant to reflect the unconscious thought processes taking place in the characters. The novel takes place in the depths of consciousness where poetic language seems entirely appropriate. This novel takes place on the surface (for lack of a better term). It is a story that is based around plot - outward events - not the inner lives of its protagonists. Faulkner has sentences where he is describing very matter of fact things, but then he throws in one of his trademark words and it is jarring.For example: Horace and Narcissa are driving and Faulkner writes ""Soon they had left the town and the stout rows of young cotton swung at either hand in parallel and diminishing retrograde."" The word ""retrograde"" just seems out of place. It is not integrated. It is like a bulge on a piece of straight thread (whereas Faulkner's other novels are more like knitted sweaters: all the pieces contribute to the whole). Faulkner is trying to write a poetic crime novel or potboiler (almost) and it is jarring at times. There are beautiful passages in the book that I think really work, and fit in the novel (when Faulkner describes Temple looking at the clock face in Reba's house), but there are also lots of places where the language just seems out of place and almost sloppy. The novel does not feel like an integrated and aesthetic whole to me.Second, I found myself getting frustrated with Faulkner's indirectness. Some degree of indirectness is necessary. If, for example, Faulkner had described Temple's rape in brutal detail when it happened, then there would have been no shock in the courtroom. It is important that the reader learn exactly what happened at the same time as the jury and Horace and the rest of the town. There are places, though, where the indirectness just seems annoying and unnecessary. Faulkner often has his characters speak in half sentences, letting the reader infer what they were going to say. The novel is a book about rape, but I am not sure whether the word ""rape"" even appears in the book, it is always just hinted at, indirectly. While I generally prefer Faulkner to Hemingway, I do sometimes prefer Hemingway's directness to Faulkner's indirectness. There is something healthy about being able to say exactly what you mean and, in a way, Faulkner's prose mirrors the hypocrisy of the society he is criticizing; a society that is incapable of saying anything directly.Finally, there is some behavior in the novel that is hard to explain. For example, why doesn't Horace take Temple with him after he goes to visit her at Reba's? He must know she was kidnapped but he just leaves her there. Some people might argue that this adds to the mystery of the novel, or the complexity of the characters, and scholars have indeed spent a great deal of time speculating about Horace's motives. While it might provide food for the critics, I am not sure whether, artistically speaking, that is a good thing. I think the reason that critics have found it so hard to explain why Horace leaves her, and why there have been so many different and competing theories, is because there is not really any very good reason, so the ground is free to invent reasons.Faulkner, of course, needed to leave her there in order to have his great climactic moment in the courtroom, but it feels like he wound up stretching believability a bit in order to save his climactic moment. There are other examples of this in the novel as well. Ruby, at one point, asks Temple ""If you are so afraid here, why don't you just leave?"" (that is a paraphrase). Good question! The critics I have read speculate: Temple is used to being led by men, she is unable to take initiative on her own, etc. Maybe. Or maybe Faulkner just did not do a good enough job providing a reason for Temple to stay. Maybe that is a genuine flaw in Faulkner's design. I think it is. Other readers might disagree.So, that is my assessment of the book such as it is. Faulkner used to say that the artist should aim for ""splendid failure""; meaning: the writer should take risks even if they wind up failing. I think what Faulkner was trying to do in this novel was very interesting and he made a worthy attempt. I am not convinced he was entirely successful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IC05XR9FQUUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679748148#wasThisHelpful","R2IC05XR9FQUUW","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sanctuary is, on its surface, one of Faulkner's more accessible works. It was, for that reason, one of his most popular for a long time. It is relatively easy to follow the basic story so a line by line commentary might seem unnecessary. However, this book really increased my appreciation for Faulkner's book. The first time I read Sanctuary I was not actually all that impressed with it. I am a huge Faulkner fan but the novel seemed strange and not all that interesting to me. After reading this book I realized just how much I was missing.This book was helpful in two ways. First, it helps to illuminate all the little subtle things I was missing. For example, in a few places Faulkner shifts into a flashback without giving any indication to the reader that he is doing so (I am thinking of the scene where Horace is talking to Miss Jenny about Narcissa and Gowan in particular). There are also places where the dialogue is somewhat cryptic. The dialogue between the three town boys as they watch Temple at the dance with Gowan, for instance. This book was extremely helpful in shedding light on lots of little details that I missed. The basic story of Faulkner's novel is fairly easy to follow but I would be willing to bet that many of the details are lost on readers. At least, they were on me.Second, the book also sheds light on some of the larger themes of the novel. My lack of appreciation for the novel after a first read through was largely because I was missing some of the interesting themes that the novel explores. For example, the relationship between the ""two societies"": the ""low society"" of bootleggers, gangsters, and prostitutes and the ""high society"" of respectable citizens. I found it particularly interesting the way the two societies were sort of photographic negatives of each other (a metaphor that Faulkner uses). There is also the theme of sexuality, of course, and how sexuality is viewed differently in the “two societies”. The novel is also a bitter attack on the hypocrisies of Christian morality. SPOILER ALERT: the good Christian citizens burn an innocent man alive and thwart justice because they are morally outraged about a man and a woman living together without being married.So, on the one hand, I felt like on my first read through of the novel I had a pretty good understanding of the overall story but I was missing lots of details. I could see the forest but not the individual trees. This book helped bring the trees into greater resolution. On the other hand, with a focus on the basic story, I was also missing some of the greater themes that were playing out through the story. So, I was also missing the forest for the trees (you might be thinking at this point that I must be blind if I was missing the trees AND the forest. What exactly did I see?). This book helped illuminate the greater themes and helped me see the forest for the trees.So, that is why I think this commentary is worth reading despite Sanctuary's outward accessibility.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A628YRKDWQB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617030538#wasThisHelpful","R3A628YRKDWQB3","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American Colonies is meant to be the first volume in Penguin's History of the United States. The first volume faces a few challenges that later volumes will not have to face. First, Taylor has to cover a lot of years in a very short space. If you include the first chapter of Taylor's book, which provides an overview of Native American history from the first migrations to North America around 13,000 BC, this volume covers almost 15,000 years of history. Even if you ignore that chapter Taylor is still forced to cover over 300 years of history. That is more than the rest of the series combined and Taylor has to fit all that history between the covers of a single volume.Second, Taylor's book covers a period before the formation of the ""United States"". There is no unified nation state that can serve to unify Taylor's narrative. There were lots of different groups of people colonizing North America in the period Taylor covers: Spanish conquistadores, Spanish missionaries, French fur traders, French explorers, Puritans, English adventurers, slave traders, and pirates (to name a few). It would be hard enough to write a one volume history of the English colonies, since they were so different from each other, but Taylor is forced to do more than that.He does an admirable job. He manages to pack a lot of interesting information between the pages of his book. Anyone reading Taylor's book will come away with a good, broad overview of early American history. They will be able to describe the differences between Puritan New England and the Virginia colony, they will have learned about the Pueblo revolt in New Mexico, the sugar plantations in the Caribbean, the Spanish missions in California, and the Russian seal hunting in Alaska, among many other things. They will learn about the Native Americans, their cultures, and their interactions with the Europeans and they will have a basic grasp of some of the ecological changes brought about by European colonization.The book serves as a good textbook on early American history. So why only three stars for my review? Well, I feel like the book read too much like a textbook. The book has to do too many things. Not only does it have to cover an impossible amount of history in a really short space but it has to come at history from all angles: political, economic, social, anthropological, and ecological. This, I imagine, was a requirement of the series, but it made for some pretty dry reading in places. I think I would have been fascinated by any of these aspects on their own but altogether it was sometimes a little painful to read.Like many readers I tend to prefer popular histories that focus on interesting characters and exciting stories, but I am also fascinated by economic trends, sociological analyses and anthropological studies. I can get very excited reading a book of pure economic history. But the fascination is always in the details and the depth. When a book has to be all things at once it winds up being somewhat shallow and not as interesting. So, I give the book four stars for content (taking into account the necessary limitations of a one volume history forced to cover such a large expanse of time) and three stars for my enjoyment.As a good hedonist, I base my overall rating on the pleasure principle and give the book three stars. After all, the information in the book will only be helpful to people if they read it, and they will only read it if they enjoy it, though I am sure there are plenty of people who will enjoy reading this book. You might be one of them. Personally, I was on the fence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OKD5U562YHMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142002100#wasThisHelpful","R2OKD5U562YHMQ","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lamb has now written two books on Hemingway's short stories. I read the first volume, Art Matters: Hemingway, Craft, and the Creation of the Modern Short Story, a couple of months ago and, despite the fact that I have never actually liked Hemingway all that much, I thought it was one of, if not the best work of literary criticism I had ever read. So I was excited to read his follow up volume and I was not disappointed. I actually think this second volume might be even better than the first, although it does help to read them in order since Lamb uses a lot of the terminology he developed in the first book, to describe Hemingway's general aesthetics, in this book.While the first book was a broad overview of Hemingway's general aesthetics and philosophy of the short story, this book is an extremely close reading (line by line in most cases) of five Hemingway short stories: Indian Camp, Soldier's Home, A Canary for One, God Rest You, Merry Gentelman and Big Two-Hearted River. Lamb's analyses are extremely detailed. Indian Camp is only about 8 pages long in the edition of Hemingway's stories that I have, but Lamb's analysis of the story is over 80 pages long. Lamb goes through the story sentence by sentence and attempts to explain Hemingway's craft: his word choice, his use of focalization, as well as his use of indirection and omission. Lamb explains in detail how each word contributes to the overall effect, as well as the themes, of the story.While Lamb's analyses are detailed they never become overly far-fetched. Most literary critics would find it difficult to write 80 pages on an 8 page story and would veer off into the speculative or the biographical in an effort to find something to say. Lamb sticks to the stories and manages to convince the reader that everything he sees in the story really is there. That is a huge achievement. Usually when I read a work of literary criticism I would say about fifty percent of what I read really resonates with me and the other fifty percent seems overly far-fetched or uninteresting, but almost everything Lamb had to say about Hemingway's stories resonated with me.There are very few works of criticism that focus in so much detail on the craft of writing. As Lamb points out in his introduction, the kind of analysis he provides is closer to what you would get if you were taking a class on creative writing, as opposed to taking a class in American literature. However, Lamb argues persuasively that considerations of craft are more important to actual writers than the usual kinds of analyses (thematic, cultural, political, psychological, etc.) offered by most literary critics. Lamb is not opposed to other forms of literary criticism but he points out that there is a huge gap in our critical literature. Lamb has shown in his two books on Hemingway how enlightening a craft analysis of literature can be and, one can only hope, that other literary critics will read Lamb's work and attempt to fill in that gap by writing their own books about the craft of other writers. I would kill for a book that was as detailed and interesting as Lamb's on: Faulkner, Lawrence, Joyce, Chekhov, and any number of other writers.I will just give one example of the differences in perspective that can result from a focus on craft. One of the stories Lamb analyzes is ""A Canary for One."" The story takes place on a train and Lamb asks, Why a train? Of course, it would be possible to offer various symbolic interpretations: the train must follow a single track, it is a symbol of the narrator's lack of control, etc. Those analyses are not wrong, and they can certainly be interesting, but they might not be uppermost in the writer's mind. The writer has to struggle with different problems. For example: Hemingway needs the narrator and his wife to be together without talking to each other. If he put them in a car they would have to talk to each other or there would be no dialogue at all (unless there was a third person, but why is she there?, etc.). Setting the story in a train resolves that problem because there can be a third person in the train compartment (the American lady).Most literary critics would simply skip over the actual function of the train in the story and focus on its symbolic aspects but this gives a somewhat distorted picture of what the writer is doing and what he is trying to achieve. The writer is not just trying to construct symbols. He is trying to communicate something (an effect) and construct something (a story). It is possible to analyze how something like a train helps to produce the desired effect without providing a symbolic interpretation (although the symbolic interpretation might also add something to the effect of the story). It is not an either/or but a both/and situation. We do not need to give up the symbolic in favor of the ""functional"" (I don't think Lamb uses that word, that is my own short-hand) but it is certainly true that most literary criticism has been one sided in the sense that it focuses on the symbolic and ignores the ""functional"".Lamb has a great quote from Northrop Frye in the introduction to his book. Frye wrote that, in the history of criticism, ""every increase of appreciation has been right, and every decrease wrong...criticism has no business to react against things, but should show a steady advance toward undiscriminating catholicity."" I think the best measure of the success of Lamb's book is this: before I read Lamb's book I found Hemingway's stories to be fairly uninteresting and dry; after reading Lamb's book Hemingway's short stories have become infinitely interesting to me and extremely powerful. Lamb has increased my appreciation for Hemingway's craft more than I would have thought possible, and that, as Northrop Frye said, is what the best literary criticism should do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8973KCE29HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807147427#wasThisHelpful","R1T8973KCE29HO","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Signet Classic edition of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. I recommend readers buy either the Signet Classic editions, or the Norton Critical editions, of Shakespeare's works. They have good notes and they have a good selection of critical essays at the end of each play. I read two other collections of critical essays on A Midsummer Night's Dream (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations) and William Shakespeare's a Midsummer Night's Dream (Bloom's Notes)) and I thought the essays in the Signet edition were much more interesting than any of the essays in either Bloom collection. I will summarize some of my favorite essays at the end of this review. But first, to the play.A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy based on mixed up lovers and mistaken identities. The four main protagonists are Lysander, Hermia, Demetrius, and Helena, and the primary plot centers around the attempt to divide the four into two suitable couples so that everyone is happy (including Hermia's father, and Theseus, the king of Athens, who is set to wed Hippolyta). None of the four main protagonists are all that interesting as characters. There is not a lot that individuates them from one another.However, the play includes two secondary plots that are, in some ways, more interesting than the main plot. There is the plot that revolves around the fairies, and the conflict between Oberon and Titania, and there is the plot that revolves around the players. The players are a group of manual laborers in Athens who have decided to put together a play for Theseus and Hippolyta's upcoming wedding. Bottom the Weaver is probably the most interesting character in the play. He is one of the actors and Puck, a trickster fairy, turns him into an ass, and Titania, the Queen of the fairies, falls in love with him. Bottom is responsible for most of the real comedy in the play.Despite the fact that the four main characters are not all that interesting, there is still a lot of great poetry in the play. Shakespeare has some great lines on the difficulties that beset love and the ephemerality of all bright and beautiful things (Act 1, Scene 1, lines 143-149), and some famous lines about the nature of poetry and the relationship between the poet, the lover and the madman (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 4-17).The play also explores a number of interesting themes. The primary theme of the play is probably the nature of love. Desire and love are seen to be independent of judgment and reason. They are changeable, and personal, and outside of the field of political power (Theseus and Hermia's father both attempt to bring Hermia's desires in line with the law, but desire is not governable, so Hermia and Lysander attempt to flee from the reach of Athenian law). There is also a mystical aspect to the play. The fairy world represents the supernatural and the earthy bottom has a vision of the fairy world that is ""past the wit of man to say what dream it was"" (Act 4, Scene 1, lines 8-9).I have always been more interested in Shakespeare's tragedies (and recently, his history plays) than his comedies. However, there is much to enjoy in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Now, onto the essays. I will summarize a few of my favorite essays from the Signet edition and then list the other essays.I thought Henry Alonzo Myers's essay ""'Romeo and Juliet' and `A Midsummer Night's Dream': Tragedy and Comedy"" was quite interesting. Myers attempts to answer the following question ""What difference in treatment of the same material - what difference in point of view toward the same material - makes possible the difference between comedy and tragedy?"" He attempts to answer that question through an examination of Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Both have love as their subject but one is a tragedy and the other is a comedy.Myers argues that tragedy is based on a vision of order in the world of values and a balance between good and evil, happiness and suffering. Myers argues that in Romeo and Juliet the characters experience both extremes of happiness and suffering and that within the tragic world the two extremes balance out. In the end the characters experience a kind of ""victory in defeat"". The ending represents a victory of the human spirit (the lovers die rather than submit to the ridiculous order of their social world, and they die with each other, they do not sacrifice their love) but also the defeat of them as finite human beings (in death).Comedy, on the other hand, transforms the frustrations of our finite reason to perceive order in the world into laughter and it is based on a principle of transformation. The characters in A Midsummer Night's Dream (with the exception of Bottom) never actually see the fairies, though the fairies are responsible for the transformations in their own desires. The characters are unable to perceive any hidden order in their shifting desires but this failure produces a comic rather than a tragic effect.The selection from John Russell Brown's Shakespeare and His Comedies was also quite interesting. He argues that the play is ultimately about the ""truth"" that is common to poets, madmen and lovers. This is not a common or universally accessible truth (the truth of judgment or reason). This truth resides in the eye of the beholder and in the imagination. Viewed from outside the shifting relationships between the lovers appears irrational but the lovers themselves tend to rationalize their shifting desires (Lysander, failing to perceive that he is under the influence of the fairies, believes that it is Helena's inherent virtues that have convinced him to shift his love from Hermia to Helena). Human life is ruled by these individual truths and rationalizations.Frank Kermode's essay, ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was probably my favorite essay in the book. Kermode sees the play as thematically about the conflict between the eye (fantasy and imagination) and reason. Love can be viewed as both lower and higher than reason. The lovers are prey to a dream that drives them into the woods (symbolizing animality and nature beyond the bounds of civilization) and their waking is a waking back to good sense and judgment. But Bottom's awakening after his ""dream"" is different. His vision represents a sight beyond reason that Kermode compares to the vision of Isis in Apuleius's The Golden Ass.This review is already ridiculously long so I will just list the rest of the essays in the volume (all of which were interesting) and then bring it to a close. These are the other essays in the Signet Classics edition: ""From the Characters of Shakespeare's Plays"" by William Hazlitt, ""The Status of the Feminine in Shakespearean Comedy"" by Linda Bamber, and ""From Shakespeare's Comic Commonwealths"" by Camille Wells Slights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BTLHWDWGIKVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451526961#wasThisHelpful","R3BTLHWDWGIKVR","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review will probably contain some spoilers. I will try to warn the reader in advance before I give anything away but if you have not seen this movie yet you should proceed with caution.I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. That was fifteen years ago but the film made a lasting impression on me. It was on television this year on Christmas and I caught a portion of it and was reminded of what a great movie it was so I went out and bought it and watched it again from start to finish. The movie is about a group of small towners who find $4 million dollars in a crashed plane and decide to keep it. It seems simple enough: they will hold onto the money until they are sure no one is looking for it. If someone does come looking for it they will burn it. There seems to be little risk but the title is meant to be ironic. Things quickly spin out of control and get very complicated.The plot is fairly simple and straight forward but this movie is much more than the standard crime caper. It is a morality tale about the corrupting influence of money, a meditation on small town despair, family tragedy, and the allure of the American dream. Hank, the primary ""protagonist"" of the film, seems happy enough when the film opens. He has a steady job, a beautiful wife, and a baby on the way. He is well respected and well liked. However, as the film progresses we learn that Hank's happiness is probably only skin deep. His father went bankrupt putting him through college and committed suicide (though Hank is apparently unaware of this, on a conscious level at least), his brother is a lonely alcoholic, and his job is less than fulfilling.Then he finds $4 million dollars and things spiral out of control. Of course, on one level it is an example of how money can corrupt but, I think, it is also about the way we trick ourselves into believing we are happy. It is like Aesop's fable about the sour grapes. The fox is unable to reach the grapes so he tells himself they are too sour. But what if the fox were to have the grapes presented to him on a silver platter? Would he still say they were too sour? This movie is about a group of people who have grapes handed to them on a silver platter and, all of a sudden, they realize they have been dissatisfied with their lives all along. They really wanted the grapes. They just seemed out of reach.SPOILER ALERT. To me, the defining moment of the movie is when Hank decides he is going to take the money back to the plane. He has already committed crimes that he never thought he would be capable of, and he has gotten himself entangled in a web of lies that is threatening to become ever more complex, but his wife, Sarah, talks him out of returning the money. She asks if he really wants to spend the next thirty years of his life working at the feed store, while their daughter is forced to wear hand me down clothes, and Sarah spends her life with a fake smile checking out library books and cooking the same dinner over and over. Suddenly there is a grinning skull of silent despair that becomes visible behind the veneer of happiness at the beginning of the film.ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT. In my opinion, the ending to the movie is perfect. Hank has been forced to commit four murders (killing his own brother in a scene reminiscent of Of Mice and Men) all in an effort to keep the money, and keep the American dream alive, only to find out that the money was meant to pay a ransom and the F.B.I. wrote down the serial numbers for about 5,000 of the bills. Realizing he will never be able to spend the money he burns it as his wife pleads with him to keep it. The ending, to me, has the force of the ancient Greek tragedies. Everything is destroyed, except Hank and Sarah, as they are forced to live out the rest of their days in quiet despair, like Oedipus whiling away his days after gouging out his own eyes.The acting in the movie is superb. Billy Bob Thornton plays a great lonely alcoholic. Jacob is a sad and fairly sympathetic character. Everyone views him as being kind of stupid, but he has a good heart, and he is wiser in some ways than his brother Hank. He understands their own family history (their dad's bankruptcy and suicide) better than Hank and he comes to understand the corrupting influence of the money sooner than Hanks does. Bill Paxton does a great job playing Hank and I was especially impressed by Bridget Fonda's transformation from a loving and moral housewife to a devious and amoral schemer.There are some people who claim the transformation of Hank and Sarah was not believable. There is some truth to that. I understand, at least, where they are coming from. However, I would like to provide an anecdote from my own life in response. A number of years ago I was watching the movie Hotel Rwanda about the genocide that took place in Rwanda and I was, as usual, resting in my own sense of moral superiority in relation to the people who committed those atrocities, when suddenly I realized ""I am a human. They are humans. Anything they are capable of, I would be capable of under the right circumstances. Our brains and nervous systems are built the same."" (Similar, in substance, to one of my favorite quotes of all time, from the Roman comic playwright Terence “I am human, I consider nothing that is human alien to me.”)I actually think that is one of the themes of this movie: that even the most ordinary, and moral, people are potentially capable of anything under the right circumstances. Who can say what we might be capable of if we were in the presence of $4 million? We have all probably daydreamed about a scenario similar to the one in this movie at some point. It is not just pieces of paper dangling in front of our imaginations in those fantasies. It is a whole new life (the same dreams that inspired the conquistadores to risk life and limb searching for a city of gold or a fountain of youth). Those kinds of dreams can wreak havoc (as they did in the case of the conquistadores) and, I think, this movie highlights the often destructive effect of the ""American dream"" in all of its shapes and forms. It is an extremely powerful dream and has historically proven itself more than capable of driving people to near insanity in its pursuit.Whatever your opinion of this movie, I think one thing that we can learn from this movie is: as much as we might daydream about finding $4 million in the woods, we better hope and pray that those dreams never come true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMHH0HOFA521R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RFDPIU#wasThisHelpful","RMHH0HOFA521R","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neuroscience is one of the fastest moving fields in science so a book written 24 years ago is bound to be a bit out of date. However, I think there is still a great deal in this book that is of philosophical value. It serves as a good introduction to Churchland's eliminative materialism and the final chapter provides a very readable introduction to tensor network theory and connectionism (at least the general principles behind them).In the first part of the book Churchland discusses the basics of the theory of neurons, functional neuroanatomy, and various techniques for studying the brain. There is probably a great deal in the first section that is somewhat out of date (unfortunately, I am not knoweldgeable enough in neuroscience to know what is or is not out of date; I doubt much of the neuroanatomy is out of date though I am sure we know more than we did when the book was written).The second part of the book delves into issues relating to philosophy of science. In this section Churchland summarizes all the main arguments made against materialism and reductionism and provides excellent and well though out responses to those arguments. The book is worth reading for the second section alone. There is almost nothing that is out of date in the second section. People are still making essentially the same arguments today as they were when the book was written and Churchland's spirited defense of materialism is still well worth reading.The final section is mostly about tensor network theory and connectionism. I know there has been a lot of work done on connectionism since this book was published and the introduction to connectionism in this volume is pretty sketchy. If you are interested in connectionism I would recommend looking elsewhere. However, Churchland does provide a very clear introduction to tensor-network theory so the last chapter is worth reading for that.I read this book over a stretch of almost a year (I moved and all my philosophy books were packed) so I am not really able to summarize the contents adequately. I wanted to write a review anyways, mainly to say: there is much in this book that is still relevant and it is still worth reading despite the fact that it is 24 years old. I learned a lot and I think many of Churchland's arguments are valid and persuasive. That is all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRIK9MF620XGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262530856#wasThisHelpful","RRIK9MF620XGN","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I should start by saying that the novel On the Road is a novel that presents serious challenges to anyone hoping to make it into a movie. There is probably a reason that this is the first (as far as I know) attempt to make the book into a movie. The book is not structured by a traditional plot: central conflict, climax, resolution. The book is about four separate journeys, the frantic search of a group of young writers, poets, and petty criminals for ""it"", some unachievable ideal. It would be very difficult to turn all of that into a coherent film so I was prepared for some pretty radical departures from the book. I was not disappointed in that regard, there were major deviations, but I do not think they were ultimately all that successful in turning the book into a coherent or interesting movie.The movie opens with some truly cringe worthy scenes of Carlo Marx (Ginsberg) reading some god-awful poetry and a heart to heart talk between Sal and Dean about their fathers, a scene that was entirely made up. Virtually every made up scene in the movie was cringe worthy to me. Whoever wrote the adaptation was clearly trying to ape Kerouac's style, which, admittedly would be difficult for anyone, but they were not really very successful. I also do not think that the soundtrack worked all that well. They had a good idea: use jazz. Jazz plays a big role in the book. Ultimately, I don't think it worked. There were scenes that I think would have been more powerful if they had been differently scored.I could also tell right away that there was not going to be any of the frantic energy of the book. They try, but again, they do not succeed. They also fail with most of the characters. Dean has none of the charisma and frantic energy that he has in the book. It is impossible to imagine why anyone would follow Dean, or put up with his non-sense, from this movie. In the book, it is clear that, as horrible as Dean can be to the people around him, he has some mysterious quality that draws people to him. They fail, in my opinion, to capture that in this movie. He is not only a con-man, he is dull and boring. The only characters I thought the movie handled well were Carlo Marx and Old Bull Lee (Ginsberg and Burroughs). All the other characters seemed flat and boring to me (MaryLou was on the border of interesting, maybe crossing it in a few moments).The movie also feels like it is just a bunch of fragmented scenes that do not really add up to a movie. I knew they were going to have to take a lot of license with the book but, if you are going to deviate as much as they did, they might as well put in a story, turn it into something coherent. They add a bunch of stuff that does not really add much to the overall story (like Carlo's homosexual relationship with Dean which, as far as I know, is historically accurate, but was not emphasized in the book). Carlo's relationship with Dean is just an isolated episode. So why take the license if it is not adding anything? There were a number of scenes that were totally made up that, in my opinion, had no purpose. Even the scenes that were taken directly from the book were not that interesting or powerful. I almost quit watching the movie out of boredom and I sort of drifted in and out for the last forty-five minutes or so.The preview of this movie really made it look good. It looked like they had captured the spirit, if not the letter, of the book, but, I think, in this case, unfortunately, looks were deceiving.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6M71ZOVSVT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWVEY3O#wasThisHelpful","R1E6M71ZOVSVT4","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have browsed through some of the negative reviews of this book and a lot of the people who really hate this book have basically the same complaints so, before I explain why I think this book is eminently worth reading, I want to quickly give people who have not yet read this book an idea of what to expect, and what not to expect, and clear up what I think are some common misconceptions about the book. That way, potential readers can get some idea of whether they are likely to enjoy reading the book. The book is not going to appeal to everyone. Our aesthetic judgments are so tied up with our values, our upbringing, our social position, and our general philosophy of life that there are certain people who are probably going to hate this book no matter what. I am convinced that Jack Kerouac was really an excellent writer and his books deserve to be considered great literature but that does not mean that everyone is going to love them. So, what are the complaints that people have with the book?A lot of reviewers complain that the novel has no plot. They are right in the sense that the novel does not follow a standard plot structure. There is no central conflict, building slowly to a climax, and ultimate resolution. The novel is told from the standpoint of Sal, who is a seeker, someone who is dissatisfied with mainstream society, and is searching for alternative life-styles and modes of being. However, in this book at least, he never really finds what he is looking for. Sal takes four road trips with his friend Dean Moriarty in search of some kind of epiphanic vision, in search of ""it"", in search of real living, but they all end in disappointment. So, if you are looking for a standardly plotted novel with a big, clear resolution at the end that wraps up all the loose ends, you are going to be disappointed with this book.It is also clear to me that a lot of people do not like the book because they do not like Dean and they feel that Kerouac is turning a petty criminal into some kind of Messiah figure. There are clearly times when Sal looks up to Dean as a kind of Messiah, a figure who promises to bring the ""real living"" that he has been searching so desperately for, but I think it is only very superficial readings of the book that can maintain that Dean is being portrayed as a Messiah figure, or as a figure to look up to and emulate. Dean represents a kind of energy that is in marked contrast to the dull, conformist society that Sal is trying to escape, but every trip Sal and Dean take together ends in disillusionment. There are places where Sal is quite explicit about this. When, for example, Dean abandons Sal and MaryLou in San Francisco Sal says ""I lost faith in him that year"" (160) Hard to be any clearer than that.Part of the problem is, I do not think Kerouac was quite as successful as he could have been distinguishing between Sal as the narrator of the tale, who is looking back on things in retrospect, and Sal as he was at the time all these things were happening. Clearly, when Sal was running around with Dean he was in thrall with him, and often did view him as kind of a savior, but there are plenty of places in the book where Sal the narrator looks back and, in retrospect, realizes he was deluded and misguided. If Sal wanted us to worship Dean he would have presented him as a less complex character than he did. Dean is actually a very complex character and there are some very poignant and moving scenes relating to Dean (when Sal is harsh with him and Dean goes outside to cry, or when he leaves him in New York and sees him walking away alone, or when he reflects on how, as a little kid, Dean had to go to court to bail his father out of jail). Dean is not a Messiah, he is a complex character, who has had a hard life, and is trying his best to figure out how to live in the world, and not doing all that great a job. He leaves an emotional wreck behind everywhere he goes. So, I think the notion that Kerouac is turning a petty criminal into a Messiah is misguided, though Kerouac also avoids the kind of smug condemnation that the members of bourgeois society engage in with Dean. Perhaps it is Kerouac's refusal to engage in such smug condemnation that people find offensive? At any rate, Kerouac is presenting a more complex picture than either extreme, as I think all artists should.So, those are the two main complaints people seemed to have (no plot, holding up a petty criminal as an ideal). But enough of that. Why do I think this book is worth reading?First, there are plenty of life lessons scattered throughout the book. For example, before his first trip out West Sal spends months pouring over maps, and he has this Romantic image of himself following a single highway (a single red line on his map) all the way out West, but, when he actually heads out he finds that reality is quite different from his dreams. Sal constantly has an image in his head of how things are going to go and they never wind up going the way he expects. The fact is, to live in this world we need to learn to role with things as they come along, to respond spontaneously in the moment, and not become too attached to our fixed plans, because reality will, time and time again, lay the best laid plans to waste. That is just one example of a solid life lesson that can easily be gleaned from On the Road.Second, as I already mentioned above, the novel is a poignant portrayal of damaged and eventually disillusioned characters, but it never collapses into total despair, nor does it get lost in a meaningless hedonism. The novel sometimes gets compared to Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises because they both portray a group of people who decide to live life in their own way outside of the established mores of contemporary society. However, Hemingway's characters, in my opinion, are truly lost, more lost than the characters in this book, because they are not even entirely aware that they are lost or, if they are, they have lost all hope of finding a way out of their lostness. They simply accept that life is always going to be a dull round of getting drunk, eating dinner, having one brief romantic fling after another, going fishing to restore their sanity, rinse and repeat, until the end of time. The characters in Kerouac's novel might be lost but they are still holding out some hope for something more than that. They might be looking in the wrong places but how else do we learn? One is not, therefore, left feeling sick with despair, even though the novel basically ends in disillusionment.Third, rather than simply presenting the final goal of knowledge the novel is about the very process of learning. It presents the process as a series of mistakes and experimentation. The worst thing to do in life, in my opinion, is to just sit and try to figure everything out. The only way to figure out what works and does not work is to try and experiment. The novel is really a coming of age novel. It is about the search for wisdom and, like I said, a lot of people think that Sal was looking in all the wrong places, and he might have been, but at least he was trying. Excess is the road to wisdom, to paraphrase William Blake. It is only by heading out and making mistakes that we ever learn anything. While the book is technically a kind of coming of age novel, the fact is, we all still have things to learn, so we are always going to be ""on the road"" so to speak, and this novel is kind of a universal representation of the human condition in its search for wisdom.Fourth, the search for alternative ways of life, which is probably the primary theme of the novel, is still a theme that resonates with a lot of people. Think of the popularity of the movie Office Space. The character in that movie is desperately unhappy and is desperately searching for another way to live. The fact that the movie was so popular is a sign that a lot of people feel the same way. A lot of people are unhappy with the kind of life that is, supposedly, the life we all should be aspiring towards: a standard nine-to-five, good paying job, with possibility for promotional advancement, etc.. In the novel these are what Sal calls ""white ambitions"". The term, and his portrayal of African Americans and other minorities in general, is a bit condescending, however, if we remove any racial overtones from the term, it names something real. A lot of people feel themselves out of touch with the values of mainstream society. It is not simply that they tried and failed, rather, even the possibility of success feels hollow and empty. When the best that society has to offer feels hollow and empty that is a problem. That is the kind of thing that leads to despair and even suicide. I am not sure that Kerouac's novel provides any air tight solutions to the problem. That is for individuals to work out for themselves. However, it does grapple seriously with the problem and will be an inspiration to anyone grappling with similar problems.Fifth, Kerouac is a good writer and there are a ton of beautiful, and genuinely lyrical passages in the novel. Kerouac's prose is ecstatic, he eschewed the naturalistic, direct prose of Hemingway and that whole line. When he wants to describe Dean, for example, he does not describe him as he actually looked in real life, he describes him as a demon, flying across the country and leaving nothing but scorched earth in his wake (that is a paraphrase, and a bad one, Kerouac's description is much more lyrical, but I am too lazy to search through the book to find it). I will provide one actual example of Kerouac's lyrical prose just to give a taste. This is Sal describing an ecstatic vision he has on the streets of San Francisco, after Dean has abandoned him, and he is essentially starving, ""And for just a moment I had reached a point of ecstasy that I always wanted to reach, which was the complete step across chronological time into timeless shadows, and wonderment in the bleakness of the mortal realm, and the sensation of death kicking at my heels to move on, with a phantom dogging its own heels, and myself hurrying to a plank where all the angels dove off and flew into the holy void of uncreated emptiness"" (162). There is more but I will stop there. It is the part about the angels diving off into emptiness that I love.Finally, the last and final reason this novel is worth reading, is the same reason that all good novels are worth reading, it presents an interesting story, full of interesting characters, and gives beautiful expression to the human condition. Late in the book Sal encounters a tall old man with flowing white hair who tells him to ""Go moan for man"". That is essentially what this book is: a moan for man. It expresses all the pain, suffering, uncertainty, and ultimately joy of living, in one giant moan, from end to end.Before I end I want to quickly mention a few critiques I have of the book. I already mentioned Kerouac's somewhat condescending portrayal of minorities. He romanticizes the lives of the oppressed and does not seem to have a whole lot of understanding of their actual condition. Besides that, I also feel like Kerouac lacks a real feel for nature. He often presents nature ecstatically, but it feels like he is presenting an idea he has of nature, as opposed to simply presenting nature directly (as in his descriptions, admittedly beautiful and moving, of the Mississippi river). He compares unfavorably, for example, with Henry David Thoreau who was a genuine and patient naturalist. Thoreau watched nature closely and could describe it in its tiniest details as it really was. Thoreau talks about how he would sometimes spend half a day standing in a river observing the behavior of a particular kind of fish. You could never imagine Kerouac doing anything like that. He is too frantic, and he is too in love with his idea of nature. Even in The Dharma Bums, which I am reading now, and which has a lot more to do with nature, you get the feeling that the narrator (I forget his name off the top of my head) is more interested in Japhy than nature. Which is fine. Kerouac, I think, was probably more interested in people than nature, but his descriptions of nature do not always ring true to me. They feel like the descriptions of nature that a city-dweller would give (which, by the way, is what I am). Nature is an image representing escape from the city but there is no real knowledge or feel for nature in the descriptions. Nature is a mere antithesis to the city.The last small critique I have is with the frantic pace. The writing is very frantically paced and, as one negative reviewer put it, it sometimes feels like listening to a child narrate a story, a child who is too excited to take the time to explain how everything fits together and just starts throwing out fragments. Now, on one hand, the frantic pace is part of the appeal. Kerouac's style mirrors his subject. Dean is really the subject of the book and Dean is a frantic human being. So, I am not saying that Kerouac should have chosen to write this book in a less frantic style. He made the right artistic choice. However, I think the frantic style is really the expression of a kind of despair. Sal and Dean always seem to be chasing something, an ideal that remains forever out of reach, however, I think, in reality, they are probably both running away from something. There is a very strange scene in the book where Sal is in a movie theater and he falls asleep and imagines what it would be like if the usher swept him up with the rest of the garbage and he spent the rest of his life in a dump. Then Sal tells a story about a time he drank too much at a bar and fell asleep around the toilet while all the sailors came and urinated and spit on him.I have a feeling that Sal's desperate search for an identity is really motivated by self-hatred and the feeling that he is garbage. It is hard to imagine a more disgusting scenario than Sal wrapped around a toilet caked in spit and urine or a more powerful image of self-loathing. I think the frantic pace gets in the way of that kind of self-reflection and psychological insight. Sal and Dean are too busy frantically searching for ""it"" to reflect on themselves or what they are doing or how they really feel. In some ways it is a very extroverted novel. The solution is always ""out there"" somewhere on the road, never within. We get a lot of idealized images of the characters, ecstatic descriptions, etc., but not a ton of psychological insight. Sal does not seem all that interested in the real motives driving behavior. He is much more interested in the archetypal pattern that each character supposedly embodies. We wind up losing the reality of the characters to a certain degree. Dean becomes a force of nature rather than a real person at times. There are some exceptions, which I have already pointed out, some hints of Dean's history, and some poignant moments expressing his humanity, but we learn very little about Sal's history, or what has led to his desperate search for an identity. I think detailed psychological analyses would probably have been out of place in this novel, they would have slowed the pace, and subtracted from the overall effect. As a piece of art On the Road is probably as it should be. However, in terms of life, and the search for wisdom, I think his characters need to spend a little less time ""leaning forward"" and a little more time examining the ground beneath their feet. Perhaps Kerouac does more of that in his later works.Despite those minor critiques this is still an excellent book that I would not hesitate to recommend to any and all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UL2MUUVHAWOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014312028X#wasThisHelpful","R2UL2MUUVHAWOC","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a few of these Twayne Masterwork books now, and a few books from a similar series called Landmarks of World Literature, and I have to say, this was one of the best I have read so far. Robert Holton does a great job analyzing the themes, the characters, and the dominating symbols of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. Whenever I read a book like this I usually like to take what I think are the most interesting insights and put notations in my copy of the original book so that when I reread it I will be reminded of them. This book took me longer to read than usual because I was stopping so often to add interesting notes to my copy of On the Road. Holton has a lot of interesting insights into the book. Early in the book Holton is describing the general indifference of the critical community towards On the Road and he quotes Tim Hunt as saying ""we are still waiting for readers, as opposed to fans"". I think Holton's book is a good first step in that direction. In the rest of my review I will give a little more detailed summary of the book for those who are interested.The first three chapters in all of these Twayne Masterworks (at least all of them that I have read) are devoted to the historical background of the book, the importance of the work (i.e. its influence on culture and literature), and critical reception. Holton highlights a number of historical developments that are important to keep in mind when reading On the Road. Holton points out that in 1956 the Federal-Aid Highway Act was passed which led to the construction of ""the new controlled-access interstate highways"". That is important because the new highways allowed for faster travel but, since they no longer passed through the small towns, it was more difficult to get a sense of the local color on cross-country trips. Highways became thoroughfares to get from point A and to point B, and the journey, or the path, between point A and B was no longer of interest. On the Road, of course, takes place before this interstate highway system which is important to realize for those of us who have grown up long after the highway system was put in place. The experience of driving across country would have been much different when Kerouac and Cassady were making their journeys.Holton also highlights the recent invention of the atom bomb as an important historical development. The bomb shows up on Sal and Dean's final journey to Mexico where Sal reflects that the Indians of Mexico, the fellahin or non-historical peoples of the world, had no idea that a bomb had been invented that could blow the whole world back to primitive times. The invention of the bomb, combined with the fear of the Cold War, the persecution of ""subversives"", and the move towards radical conformism, are behind the sense of the deterioration and general sickness of Western civilization in the novel. Sal is always trying to find a way out of Western civilization, what he calls the world of ""white ambitions"", and as Holton remarks, for Kerouac hope lay with the ""misfits and eccentrics"" of the world (6).In terms of the importance of the work and the critical reception, Holton points out that the work was very influential in terms of inspiring a counter-culture to the dominant Cold War culture, and also inspired the sixties counter-culture movement, but the impact was sort of taken over and commercialized, as all things tend to be (8) William S. Burroughs made a comment about On the Road selling ""a trillion levis and espresso machines"" (8). The critical reception of the book was mixed. Kerouac was lucky that the standard New York Times book reviewer was on vacation when the book was published and the stand in was very sympathetic to Kerouac's views, so he got a glowing review in the New York Times. Other reviews were more mixed or wholly negative. Holton also points out that the work has not been taken all that seriously by the critical establishment even up to the present. That is what lies behind Tim Hunt's claim that the book is still looking for readers as opposed to fans.The next five chapters are each devoted to one of the four journeys taken by Sal and Dean in the book (the first chapter being about their ""setting out""). I am not going to try to summarize each chapter or journey but simply pull out what I thought were some of the most interesting insights into the themes and symbols of the novel from these sections of the book.Leslie Fiedler, in her book Love and Death in the American Novel, argues that American writers tend to seek ""the last horizon of an endlessly retreating vision of innocence - on the 'frontier'...where the theory of original goodness and the fact of original sin come face to face"" (quoted on 28). Holton uses those words to describe Dean. On the one hand, he is the ""natural man"", free from the constraints of society, he gives natural expression to his desires and sexuality, and yet, because he is, in a sense, beyond good and evil, he also illustrates the reality of original sin, his lack of a sense of evil allowing him to ""commit a variety of crimes, including violence and betrayal"" (28). That, I think, is a great characterization of Dean, and I think it is important because I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews of On the Road here on amazon tend to assume that Dean is a Jesus or Messiah figure who can do no wrong. There is no doubt that Sal often does view Dean as a kind of savior, but Dean as a character, and Sal's ultimate evaluation of Dean and his philosophy of life are, I think, much more complex than that. I think that if Kerouac had been trying to argue, as many people think, that we could find salvation by simply giving free reign to our desires, Dean would have been a much simpler and less interesting character than he actually was.Holton also offers a good description of the book as a whole when he says that ""The narrative...is episodic, picaresque rather than densely structured or deeply plotted, replete with wrong turns, unexpected adventures, and roads that lead nowhere"" (31). This is another thing that seems to turn people off of the book. There is no central conflict and resolution, it is not a traditionally plotted novel. Really, as Holton argues throughout the book, the book is a set of journeys, all in search of ""it"", some final epiphanic vision at the end of the road, capable of saving Sal from mainstream conformist American society, but that final vision never comes. The closest they get is their last trip to Mexico and Mexico city, which Sal considers the beatest city they have been to, but that whole episode ends with him getting dysentery. The novel is fueled by a hope for something indefinite, each journey has an elusive final goal that Sal is not even capable of fully articulating, but all the journeys end in disappointment. Apparently, that structure is not enough to hold everyone's interest but it is probably closer to real life than more standard plot structures.Holton also points out that Sal runs into complications as soon as he sets out on his journey (32-33). He has spent months pouring over his maps, and he has a dream of following a single highway all the way across the country, but, as often happens, his dreams do not match up with reality, and he is forced to improvise.  This sets out a vision of reality as chance and chaos that runs throughout the whole book. It is pointless to have overly detailed plans because reality will always spoil them. As Holton says ""Life on the road is a life of hazard, chance, and being on the road entails a willingness to accept whatever arbitrary circumstances turn up"" (39). The lesson is: if you want to live in the world you need to learn to move with things, improvise on the spot, and roll with the punches. Sitting down in your room and planning out your future has never worked for anyone (I know, I have tried). Holton even goes so far to say that this tension between representation and reality is one of the structuring elements of the novel (in the absence of traditional plot). Another lesson of the novel is: a lot of life is about how you handle the inevitable disharmonies between representation and reality. I think this lesson is part of the reason so many people can relate to the book, and feel a connection with the book, even though few readers (probably) have ever set off across the road in quite the way that Sal and Dean did.Holton continually highlights what is probably the dominating theme of the whole book: Kerouac's search for identity and alternative modes of life. Sal is constantly encountering marginal figures (racial minorities, homeless people, cowboys, etc.) who do not seem to fit into mainstream society. Holton also points out that many of Kerouac's portrayals of minorities are at least naive if not downright condescending. Sal does not seem to have much insight into the realities of the lives of African Americans, migrant farm workers, etc. and the oppression and racism they suffer from. Sal tries on a number of their roles himself, becoming a migrant farm worker for awhile, but, as Holton points out, he is really a tourist. He romanticizes their life, but he has chosen it, they have not. He can wire his aunt for money whenever he wants and he eventually does. While some of Sal's views on race seem naive and condescending the theme of searching for alternative modes of life still resonates. Think of the movie Office Space. The main character is miserable at his job, tries to escape it through criminality, which is a total failure, and winds up finding a way out by becoming a construction worker. One could argue that this romanticization of the life of the construction worker is quite similar to Sal's romanticization of the life of migrant workers. While it may be unrealistic there is clearly something there that resonates with people.Holton has an excellent analysis of the symbol of the Mississippi river and the role it plays in the novel. Holton argues that, along with Kerouac's symbol of the rainy night, the Mississippi serves as a symbol for the cycle of birth-life-death-and rebirth that structures all of existence. The waters of the Mississippi flow down across the country until they terminate in the ""Gulf of the Night"" (i.e. death), then the sea rises in the form of clouds, and the clouds turn to rain, which falls and joins the Mississippi to begin the cycle all over again. I think that this symbol of time is closer to the ideal than Dean's frantic drive for more. Dean continually claims that he ""knows time"", but he is always ""leaning forward"" in a frantic drive to find ""it"". The novel has a number of symbols of a much more serene view of time. There is nowhere to get to in the endless cycles of the Mississippi. There is no goal to the process. This is another reason I think it is a mistake to view Dean as a savior who is in possession of the secret of the world. Sal is young, he is still in the process of forming a philosophy of life, and Dean's view of life is his starting point, but not necessarily his ending point.So, those were a few of the insights I found most interesting in Holton's book. If you found any of them at all interesting, and you are a fan of On the Road, I recommend reading Holton's book. You will find more insights in his book than I have been able to summarize.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMXN8CX53S9ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805716920#wasThisHelpful","RMXN8CX53S9ML","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second volume of Mishima's tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility, and it is the story of Isao, a young reincarnation of Kiyoaki, the main character in Spring Snow: The Sea of Fertility, 1. Isao, the son of Iinuma from the first book, is a kendo student who is disgusted with the corruption of contemporary Japan, and has adopted a short novella called The League of the Divine Wind as his personal political manifesto. Isao dreams of carrying out an act of total purity and devotion to the emperor before committing ritual suicide on a cliff overlooking the sea. The novel is about Isao, the group of like-minded teenagers he gathers around him, and their plot to cleanse Japan of corruption through political assassination. The novel takes place just after the great stock market crash and subsequent world-wide depression. Isao and his group blame the plight of the poor in their country on the rich capitalists but they are unwilling to join the communists since the communists lack the necessary reverence for the emperor.The novel is not, in my opinion, as good as the first volume of the tetralogy, but is still worth reading. The novel continues to develop some of the themes from the first novel, particularly the theme of what the sociologist Max Weber called the disenchantment of the world following the spread of Western science and legalism. There is a conflict of values operating in the novel between the rational legal system and the irrational spirit of Isao and his young followers. The members of the League of the Divine Wind feel that the Japanese state has abandoned the old gods, and the Japanese national character, in favor of Western rationalism and utilitarianism. Honda, who readers will remember as Kiyoaki's friend from the first book, is torn between the competing values. He is a judge, so he sees himself as a representative of the law, and sees the ideal judge as one who carries out the law rationally, without being swayed by emotion. However, his firm belief that Isao is the reincarnation of Kiyoaki shakes his rational worldview.It is not clear to me to what degree Mishima endorses the values of Isao. Mishima is, of course, almost as famous for his politics as he is for his writing, and no one reading this book can fail to see the similarities between Isao's plan, and the plan to stage a coup actually carried out by Mishima right before committing ritual suicide. The book is much more overtly political than the first novel in the tetralogy and I think that is one reason that it is not as good as the first book. The politics seem a bit naive to say the least. I also do not think that Mishima was really a master of the taut plot. In Spring Snow that did not really matter as much because the story was focused on a love affair, the passions of the characters, and Mishima's psychological insights. This novel has more of an ""action"" plot, for lack of a better term, and the summary of the story certainly makes it seem exciting, but, in reality, it is almost entirely lacking in real dramatic tension, except for a few moments (like Makiko's testimony). Mishima is at his best when he is analyzing the psychology of his characters and his psychological insights often transcend his overt political statements. For example, at one point in the novel Mishima writes about Isao ""whenever the slovenly beauties that covered the garish kiosks on the street corners troubled his thoughts on the way to school, this for him was an indication of the corrupt state of politics. He and his comrades had formed a political union that was necessarily based upon their boyhood sense of shame"" (198).It is clear that Isao, especially in his relation to Makiko, is experiencing an awakening of sexual feelings, and those feelings are attended by feelings of shame. Isao projects those feelings onto the state of Japan and feels that the entire state is corrupt and needs to be cleansed by his purity. Isao's obsession with purity is really a reaction against his own overwhelming sexual feelings and his own feelings of being unclean (that is my theory anyways). This is an example of Mishima's often profound psychological insight, and if carried to its logical conclusion it would lead to a rather serious critique of Isao's naive political goals, and his claim that he is acting from pure motives, but I am not sure that Mishima really follows through with the insight. Isao is still portrayed as a strong willed and deeply devout individual, and almost everyone he meets views him in the same way and admires his purity of spirit, even Honda, the representative of rationality. Ultimately, I think this novel falls somewhat short of Mishima's often perceptive psychological insights and, as a novel, it is not quite as engaging as the first novel of the tetralogy.Perhaps the message of the book will become clearer to me after I have finished the tetralogy. SPOILER ALERT. It is true that, at the end of the book, Isao does seem to recognize that he has been devoted to an illusion and, if Mishima himself had not carried out a plan very similar to Isao's it would be easy to say that the novel represented Mishima's condemnation of the naive ideal of purity, or if not condemnation, at least the recognition that Westernization was here to stay. If that were true I would probably like the novel much more than I did, but it is hard to believe that, both because of the events of Mishima's own life, and because Isao is almost always an object of praise all throughout the book. Perhaps Mishima felt it was noble and pure to sacrifice oneself for a hopeless ideal. Admittedly, I know very little about Mishima's life other than the bare outlines of its dramatic end, though I intend to read at least a couple of the biographies that are out once I have made my way through most of his novels. Perhaps they will help me place this novel into perspective. At any rate, the novel is worth reading for the moments of psychological insight, the way it develops and complicates the themes of the tetralogy, and the picture it gives of Japan caught between its past and its future. However, as a novel, I thought it fell a bit short of Spring Snow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7170FGU4BUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679722408#wasThisHelpful","R3O7170FGU4BUF","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warning: there are some SPOILERS in this review, but I will warn the reader in advance. If you have not read the book yet you should be safe reading my review as long as you heed the warnings when they appear and take appropriate action. I am putting my faith in you, dear reader, do not disappoint me...There is a book on the philosophy of biology, written by Kim Sterelny and Paul E. Griffiths with the interesting title ""Sex and Death"". (You can find it here). I have not read the book but I find it interesting that the subject matter of biology can be so succinctly summarized. Biology is the study of life and no one who studies life can ignore the overwhelming realities of sex (all life reproduces itself) and death (for each individual life eventually comes to an end). One of the reasons I find it so interesting that the field of biology can be summarized in two words is because I also happen to think that the themes of literature can also be summarized by the same two words. I feel fairly certain that every novel, poem, or play I have ever read has either been about sex or death (and usually both). That is certainly true of Yukio Mishima's novel, Spring Snow, which is the first in his Sea of Fertility tetralogy. Sex and death which, in Mishima's novel, appear in the guise of beauty and impermanence, are the dialectical forces that structure the novel. There is heart-breaking beauty in the world but, as seemingly transcendent as the experience of beauty can be, ultimately nothing can escape the reality of impermanence. Mishima skillfully weaves a tragedy out of the intertwining threads of beauty and impermanence.The novel centers around a love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko. Kiyoaki's family is of a lower social station than Satoko's so Marquis Matsugae (Kiyoaki's father) sends his son to be educated in Satoko's household as a child. The novel begins years later when Kiyoaki is nineteen years old and living back at home. A love begins to blossom between Kiyoaki and Satoko but the Marquis winds up arranging a marriage between Satoko and Prince Toin which she does not feel she can refuse. At a crucial moment in the story Kiyoaki fails to present any objections to the arrangement and the engagement moves past the point of no return when the Emperor approves of the engagement between Satoko and Prince Toin. To break the engagement off after the Emperor's approval would be sacrilege so Kiyoaki and Satoko are forced to engage in a secretive love affair in the brief period between the engagement and the wedding ceremony.The novel is thematically rich and I am not going to be able to summarize all of the themes of the novel. It is also worthwhile remembering that this is the first novel in a tetralogy so the themes become, I am sure, more complex as the novels progress. I have just started the second novel in the series and I can already see Mishima developing some themes in that novel that were merely hinted at in this one. I will simply highlight what I think are some of the most interesting themes of the novel.There is definitely a Buddhist metaphysics operating throughout the novel. There are lots of references to impermanence throughout the novel, to ""time's dissolving whirlpool"" (163), to ""the monstrous roar of negation"" that surrounds ""the merest flicker of time"" (244), and to the minor changes that are constantly altering everything in the world. When Kiyoaki sees Satoko after a period of absence ""He felt that he was looking at a fine painting whose colors, once brilliant, were fading horribly before his very eyes. What he had spent ten days praying to see in an agony of expectation had undergone a subtle change"" (275). Everything changes, the world is ceaseless becoming, and human beings are particularly finite and changeable. There are two Siamese princes visiting Kiyoaki and one of them is in love with a princess back at home. SPOILER ALERT: THIS IS YOUR FIRST WARNING READER. While the princes are vacationing with Kiyoaki and Honda they learn of the princess' death. The Siamese prince says ""I clearly saw the bright sea and the shining beach just as they were. Why wasn't I able to see the subtle change that had occurred deep in the substance of the universe? The world was constantly and imperceptibly changing"" (253). We can see here the Buddhist notion that permanence is an illusion. Nothing remains the same even for a moment though our minds are not always subtle enough to grasp the changes.This sense of impermanence hovers over the love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko. There is a scene where Kiyoaki and Satoko make love underneath the shadow of a boat on the beach to hide from the moonlight. Mishima writes that ""They were not lying in the protection of a solid structure or a rocky ridge, but of something fortuitous, that in a few brief hours might be far out to sea"" (243). Satoko is afraid that ""this huge old fishing boat might begin to slide noiselessly across the sand even now and plunge into the water and sail away"" (243). The boat is a metaphor for the temporary conditions that make their love affair possible. The wedding ceremony has not taken place yet. Satoko is still able to escape at times with the help of her attendant Tadeshina. Kiyoaki and Satoko are very aware that the possibility of their love affair is dependent on fortuitous and impermanent conditions. When those conditions alter their love affair will end. Mishima is expressing the Buddhist metaphysical principle of codependent origination. Nothing has inherent existence but depends on its conditions for existence and those conditions are radically impermanent. This is why I said at the beginning of my review that Mishima weaves a tragedy out of the intertwining threads of beauty (both Kiyoaki and Satoko are noted for their exquisite beauty) and impermanence.Another theme running throughout the novel is the difference between different possible relations to life. This is most clearly expressed in the differing characters of Kiyoaki and Honda (Honda's character is developed further in the later novels of the tetralogy and the contrast becomes even more apparent). There is an early scene where the two characters are lying in the grass. Mishima writes that ""The rough grass pricked through the backs of their kimonos, making Kiyoaki rather uncomfortable. It gave Honda, however, the sensation of having to endure an exquisitely refreshing pain"" (18). I think the two relations to life are beautifully expressed in this scene. The grass seems to me to be a metaphor for samsara. It reminds me of the hair-shirts that Christian saints used to wear to remind themselves of the suffering of this world. Kiyoaki is not really comfortable in this world, while Honda is. Immediately following this description of Kiyoaki and Honda on the grass Honda asks ""what more could you want from a day like this?"" Honda is clearly happy in the world of samsara, but Kiyoaki wants something more, ""Something definite. What it might be, I've no idea"" (18).I am convinced that Kiyoaki is devoted to an other-worldly beauty. Kiyoaki gets his first vision of this other-wordly beauty when he is a page attending Princess Kasuga (9). Ordinarily, such an experience would have solidified the worldly feelings of nationalistic loyalty, but Kiyoaki's tutor, Iinuma, knows that ""it was hopeless to expect him [Kiyoaki] to swear the enthusiastic oaths of loyalty to the Emperor that a night like this would have invoked in any normal young Japanese boy striving toward manhood"" (11-12). Kiyoaki has glimpsed something that transcends all worldly social obligation. SPOILER ALERT: THIS IS MY SECOND WARNING READER. At the end of the novel, the love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko has ended, and Satoko has taken vows as a nun. Kiyoaki goes to try to see her in the monastery and on his walk into the monastery has another vision of other-wordly beauty. This is one of the most beautiful passages in the book. It is too long to quote in full but here is some of it ""The scenery that had become familiar in recent days now had a strange novelty about it that was almost unnerving...Surrounded by unbroken silence and utter clarity was a world untouched by blemish of any kind. And at its center, so inexpressibly poignant, at its innermost heart, he knew, was Satoko herself, her figure as quiet and still as an exquisite gold statue. But could such a still and perfect world, which eschewed all intimacy, really bear any relation to the familiar world he knew?"" (375)That last sentence is important. The beauty that Kiyoaki glimpses seems to have little to no relation to the everyday world. The everyday world is the world of impermanence. This is a standard conflict in Japanese literature I believe: between beauty and impermanence. It is also important that right after this vision Kiyoaki is reminded of his experience as a page for Princess Kasuga (375-376). This connects his other-worldly vision of beauty in the monastery with his earlier experiences and makes it clear to the reader that Kiyoaki has been devoted to something other-worldly his whole life and has followed it to his own death and destruction.Another theme the novel highlights is the conflict between passion and social taboos. Passion is an irrational force that goes beyond the bounds of law and propriety. Kiyoaki and Satoko know that they are violating social taboos in having their affair after the Emperor had already given his approval to Satoko's engagement. Their affair threatens the state and its sovereign. SPOILER ALERT. Late in the novel, after Satoko has cut off her hair as a prelude to taking the vows, Mishima writes ""No one considered Satoko's soul; it was her hair alone that pertained to the national interest"" (332). The soul, and its passions, lie outside the bounds of the state. Passion cannot be channeled into socially acceptable forms. The wind bloweth where it listeth. This is desire as a potentially destructive and revolutionary force. Desire can alter social customs and the world of social customs that Mishima is describing in this novel were undergoing radical changes. Mishima seems to see something beautiful in this devotion to the irrational even when it leads to your own destruction.There is also an interesting play within a play in the novel that I think highlights a number of themes of the novel. Honda is training to be a judge and so he goes to the courtroom to watch a case being tried. A woman is being tried for killing her boyfriends lover. I will not describe all the details but there are a few important details. First, the murderess stabbed her boyfriend's lover with one of his knives. She claims she only went to talk to the woman and try to reason with her but why did she bring the knife? She claims that she was getting it sharpened as a nice gesture for her boyfriend. She does get the knife sharpened but she does not feel like going home immediately and instead goes to find her boyfriend's lover. It is clear in Mishima's narration that the woman is unclear about her own motives. She has rationalized her motives. She clearly intended to stab the woman but that was too heinous to admit, even to herself, so she invented a pretext for taking the knife with her. This is one example, of many, of really perceptive psychological insight on the part of Mishima.At the beginning of the tale Mishima writes ""it was clear enough that the chain of events leading up to this crime of passion had unfolded relentlessly in a manner that must lead inevitably to tragedy"" (204). This is also a Buddhist metaphysical principle. It is impossible to escape the chain of causes. None of the actors in the tragedy intended such an end but once the first decision was made, and enacted, a chain of causes was set in motion that was beyond the control of any of the participants. I call this episode a play within a play because it dramatizes in a condensed fashion the drama of Kiyoaki and Satoko's love affair. Everything that is said about the tragic story of the murderess could also be said about Kiyoaki and Satoko's situation.As I believe Heraclitus said ""Character is fate"". We are driven by unconscious motives (what, in another part of the book, is described in Buddhist terms as the storehouse consciousness) just as the woman was driven by unconscious motives when she took the knife with her. Similarly, Kiyoaki is led to his own destruction through his own passion. There is also a point about being part of a web of causality over which we have little control. The murderess says ""If only Hide [her boyfriend's lover] had not been there that night, everything would have been alright"" (205). Our fates are ruled by fortuitous circumstances. SPOILER ALERT. It is also clear that the tragedy of Kiyoaki and Satoko has seeds that lie beyond either of their conscious decisions, in a pact made between Count Ayakura (Satoko's father) and Satoko's attendant Tadeshina when Kiyoaki and Satoko were still small children (306).There are two other themes I want to quickly highlight. First, there is the theme of consciousness bringing pain. Early in the novel an Abbess tells a parable. A man lay down to sleep in a cemetery at night and awoke with a thirst. He reaches out his hand and scoops some water from a hole and drinks. The water tasted pure and delicious but when he awoke he saw that he had been drinking out of a skull. The man realized that when it was dark, when his conscious mind was not operating and making distinctions based on desire, the water tasted refreshing, but as soon as it was light, as soon as he was able to make distinctions, he was disgusted. This is another Buddhist principle. As long as we make distinctions based on desire we suffer. Honda has a very interesting question after hearing this parable ""once Yuan Hsaio had been thus enlightened, could he drink that water again, secure in the knowledge that it was pure and delicious?"" (31). This, to me, highlights the impotence of consciousness. We cannot just decide not to be disgusted and the insight alone will not allow us to drink water from a skull without being disgusted. This requires a much more fundamental transformation.There is another place where the theme of consciousness being the source of suffering arises. There is a scene between Baron Shinkawa and his wife. His wife is talking about how beautiful her kimono is and ""how gorgeous it would look to someone on the other side [of the lake] who saw it reflected in the water"". She complains ""Why can't I be on both sides of the pond at once? One is so frightfully limited, isn't one, don't you think?"" (127). We cannot be and see ourselves at the same time. This is part of our finitude. We want to consciously enjoy things and be them at the same time. We want to be happy and see ourselves being happy at the same time. D.T. Suzuki talks about this in Zen Buddhism. It is impossible and this is a cause of suffering. Consciousness makes it impossible to fully correspond to ourselves. We are always outside ourselves to a degree. We can never entirely be ourselves, but we also cannot fully escape our embodiment and just see ourselves.The final theme I want to highlight is the Nietzschean joy in destruction that I see operating throughout the novel. There are a number of places in the novel where a character is in agony and joy at the same time, or, where a character seems to feel joy at the thought of their own destruction. Nietzsche believed that was the essence of tragedy. Tragedy affirmed life by affirming the joy in destruction. I am convinced that Mishima's novel represents a similar sensibility. This novel really succeeds in exploring the fundamental conflicts that shape human life: the conflict between activity and passivity, passion and reason, nature and society, the individual and society. Tragedy tends to be made of these conflicts and this novel is certainly made of the same conflicts as Greek tragedy. Like the tragedians, however, Mishima is too good an artist to come down simplistically in favor of one side or the other. If Kiyoaki represents passion and individuality and Honda represents reason and social duty it would be too simplistic to say that the novel endorses one at the expense of the other (this also becomes clear in the second novel). It would also be a mistake to reduce either character to one side. Like Yin and Yang, both Kiyoaki and Honda contain their opposites within themselves.Besides being thematically rich the novel is also beautiful and lyrically written. The lyricism of Mishima's writing really comes across in the translation. Mishima is also able to construct a novel that is both specific, it takes place at a particular time and place, and universal, the themes transcend that specific time and place. Sometimes love stories set in different times and places fail to reach the level of universality. They become bogged down in the specific etiquette and social customs of a particular time and place and fail to reach the universal human emotions that are present in all times and places. Mishima's novel does not suffer from such a failing. Mishima is also able to convey powerful emotions through restraint. The final meeting between Kiyoaki and Satoko is beautifully written and heart-breaking. It is a central scene in the novel and it is a scene that, I imagine, would be difficult to write. Mishima handled it perfectly. He was a true master. I am definitely looking forward to making my way through the rest of his oeuvre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FMXNUYLDXF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679722416#wasThisHelpful","R4FMXNUYLDXF1","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read this novel twice and, in all honesty, I did not enjoy it all that much either time. After reading it the second time I decided to read some criticism on the work to see what I was missing. I found two helpful collections of critical essays: The Sun Also Rises edited by Harold Bloom and The Sun Also Rises edited by Kelly Wand, and a short, book-length treatment of the novel: The Sun Also Rises: A Novel of the Twenties by Michael S. Reynolds. I would recommend all three to anyone wanting to dive a bit deeper into Hemingway's novel. I have also spent a great deal of time thinking and reflecting on the novel. I have been trying to figure out what I liked about the novel and why I did not like it more than I did. I have reached some tentative conclusions. I will try to share some of those conclusions in my review. I definitely think this novel is worth reading even if you do not enjoy it.SUMMARY OF THE BOOK AND SOME OF THE THEMESThe novel follows a group of American and British expatriates in Paris. Jake is the war wounded narrator, Brett is the woman that pretty much all the men are in love with, Mike is Brett's fiance, Robert Cohn is the Jewish boxer who tends to be the punching bag of the group, and Bill is an American writer. Jake takes a trip every year to the San Fermin festival in Pamplona to see the bullfights and he invites the rest of the gang to go along. The novel is really about the changing relationships between the characters. Anyone expecting a really dramatic story is going to be disappointed. Traditionally the novel has been viewed as a portrait of the so-called ""lost generation"". Virtually all the characters in the novel, with the possible exception of Cohn, have been wounded in some way by the war, and there is no doubt that the characters in the novel are all suffering from a lack of sustaining values. However, Hemingway himself, apparently, did not like the term ""lost generation"" even though he used Gertrude Stein's quote as one of the epigraphs for the book.There are really two central conflicts in the novel. The first is obvious and revolves around Robert Cohn's love for Brett. Robert Cohn is the only character who did not fight in the war and he is the only character who still believes wholeheartedly in Romantic love. He is the least cynical character in the book. He is, perhaps, a bit of a Don Quixote figure, still defending an outmoded value system. This gets him into trouble with Brett with whom he has a short affair. The relationship between Cohn and Brett highlights the dangers inherent in all relationships. If the two parties have different ideas about what the relationship is about, and different value systems in general, there is likely to be miscommunication, misunderstanding, and heart-break.Cohn's conflict is the obvious conflict but, as Michael S. Reynolds points out in his book, the central conflict really revolves around Jake. It is difficult for the reader to pick up on the central conflict (I missed its importance until I read Reynolds' book) because Jake tends to make himself invisible in his narration. Jake is also in love with Brett but because of an unfortunate war wound is incapable of physical love. Brett seems to love Jake as well but cannot settle for a non-physical relationship so Jake has to watch her sleep around with other men. Jake has a real love for bullfighting. He goes to the bullfights every year and he is the only American that the Spanish respect as possessing aficion, or passion, about the bullfights. Bullfighting gives Jake some sustaining values: courage, honor and artistry, among them. However, Jake is unable to say no to Brett, and winds up pimping her out (Cohn's words) to the bullfighter Pedro Romero. A Spanish hotel owner with whom Jake has had a relationship for a number of years sees this and by the end of the novel the two are no longer on speaking terms. This is, as Reynolds argues, the central tragedy of the book. Jake was given a moral test and he failed, and his trips to Pamplona, if he continues them, will never be the same.There are lots of interesting themes in the novel. There is, of course, the theme of emasculation. Jake is emasculated in the war and is further emasculated in his relationship to Brett. Despite Hemingway's reservations about the term ""lost generation"" the destruction of traditional values after the war is clearly another theme of the novel. Jake and his group do not really have a sustaining philosophy of life. At one point Jake claims that ""Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth"" but claims that in five years that philosophy will ""seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had"" (148). Jake also claims ""I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it"" (148). Technically Jake is Catholic but we learn throughout the book that he does not have much religious feeling. That is, perhaps, another casualty of the war. So, throughout the novel, we see a group of people trying to figure out how to live, and not doing all that great a job at it.Another theme that I found very interesting is the return to more primitive, one might say pagan, value systems as a replacement for Christianity. This shows up in a number of places in the book. Jake and Bill go on a fishing trip in Burguete and meet a British man named Harris and they all go to visit a monastery. They all agree it is a remarkable place but, Bill asks, ""It isn't the same as fishing though, is it?"" The others agree that it is not. Clearly, there is an attempt to return to nature here, and nature is viewed as more reinvigorating than traditional religion. The only time the reader gets any sense of health reading this novel is in the descriptions of nature and in the characters' contact with nature. There is also an interesting mix between the Christian and the pagan in the San Fermin festival. It is, in name at least, a Christian festival in honor of a Christian saint, but the practice of bullfighting (sacrificing the bull) is a much more primitive religious practice, and it is clear that all of the characters, especially Jake, are much more moved by the bullfighting than they are by the Christian aspects of the festival. There is, it seems to me, an attempt in the novel to move back to a more primitive form of religion to find some sustaining values after the collapse of Christianity. There is a similarity here between Hemingway's novel and T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land (Norton Critical Editions).WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK OR WHAT HEMINGWAY DID WELLNow, before I try to explain what I did not like about the novel I want to highlight a few things I liked about the novel. First, Hemingway does a great job portraying powerful emotions. There is an interesting exchange between William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway that I think is relevant. William Faulkner criticized Hemingway by saying ""He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary"". Hemingway replied by saying ""Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words?"" Personally, I much prefer Faulkner to Hemingway, but Hemingway definitely has a point here. Sometimes simple and direct is more powerful. There is a scene where Mike and Robert Cohn get into a fight. Mike calls Robert Cohn a steer because he is always ""hanging about so"". Hemingway (or Jake) simply writes ""We were embarrassed"". That is all that is necessary to convey the discomfort and the powerful emotions broiling beneath the surface of the scene. It is a very painful scene to read.There is another scene where Brett says ""Oh darling...I'm so miserable"" and Jake replies ""You were happy a minute ago"" and Brett replies again ""It's all gone"". To me, that is much more powerful than if Brett had tried to write an impromptu poem expressing her misery or provide some literary metaphor for her depression (""it is as wide and deep as the ocean"" or something like that). Just saying ""I'm so miserable"" is more powerful than any literary trope which will tend to sound contrived. There is really an emotional hell just beneath all the quiet stoicism and ironic detachment of this novel and Hemingway does a great job conveying that in very few words. It is part of the reason reading the novel is not always all that pleasant of an experience. We can feel the misery and despair that is just beneath all the supposed gaiety. Hemingway also used to say that writers should portray how people actually feel rather than how they think they are supposed to feel. He definitely lives up to that. We have, I think, a lot of misconceptions about love. Love is a very complex emotion that is mixed up with a lot of other emotions and not all of them are positive. Pride and jealousy, for example, both play a huge role in the emotion we call love. Hemingway portrays the complexity of love, and the destructive ingredients of love, quite well.Another thing I appreciated about the novel was Hemingway's sparse style in his descriptions of nature. I have been reading Henry David Thoreau recently, and as much as I love Thoreau, and as great a naturalist as he was, Thoreau still gets caught up in some of the standard literary tropes when describing nature. It does not feel direct. It is mediated by literature. Hemingway describes nature directly. There is actually a place in the book where he writes ""The trees were green"" (94) and that is his entire description of the trees. There are no descriptions of Apollo driving his winged chariot across the sky, etc.. Hemingway cuts all that away. If I am honest with myself I really prefer a slightly more ornate style. I prefer Faulkner to Hemingway. However, I do think that Hemingway's sparse style was necessary. It was like a cleansing forest fire. It removed a bunch of sick and dead foliage and allowed new shoots to bloom in literature. For that I am very grateful to Hemingway.REASONS I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK MORE THAN I DIDThe first thing to be said is: I am a philosophy student. I love ideas and I enjoy metaphysical speculation. Hemingway was not really a philosopher. He was clearly more interested in character and emotion. There is big emotion in this book but there are not really any big ideas in it (none that I have found anyways). I have a feeling that Hemingway would have considered metaphysical speculation unhealthy. While I can appreciate that standpoint to life it does not change the fact that I tend to prefer novels that have big ideas in them or helpful insights into life. There are not that many helpful insights into life in the novel. There is not a lot of wisdom to be found. The characters are all lost, trying to figure out how to live in the world, and while they are certain that the old ways of living in the world are no longer possible, they do not yet have much to offer in their place. The lack of big ideas and insights into life is one reason I did not like the novel more than I did.There is also a lack of sincerity in the novel. A number of critics really loved the fishing scene with Jake and Bill. They seemed to think it highlighted Bill's humor. To me, it highlighted Bill's incessant sarcasm and lack of sincerity. When they eat lunch they have kind of a mock saying of grace. I find this inability to be sincere to be a rather annoying trait. The characters are all very cynical and they clearly despise (at least at times) the one character who does not entirely share in their cynicism: Robert Cohn. To me, Robert Cohn and Brett Ashley were the most sympathetic characters in the book. Robert Cohn may be delusional but at least he believes in something and is willing to look foolish in defending what he believes. Brett Ashley may make emotional mincemeat out of most of the men in her life but she does not seem cruel to me. She is just wounded and desperate. From the criticism I read on the novel, however, it does not seem like most readers share my views. Most readers think that Cohn and Brett are very unsympathetic characters. If that is how Hemingway intended them it goes a long way towards explaining why I did not like the book more than I did. I think novelists should always try to understand their characters and genuine understanding always breeds sympathy. If a character is portrayed as extremely unsympathetic chances are they are a cardboard cutout character, with no real depth, enlightened by a merely superficial gaze.The novel is also quite depressing. It is, in my opinion, much more depressing than more openly nihilistic novels (Celine and Beckett, for example). The characters are all caught up in what the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard called the aesthetic existential sphere. There is despair beneath the surface of the aesthetic sphere but it is unconscious. Openly nihilistic novels are expressions of conscious despair. In The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard argues that unconscious despair is worse than conscious despair. At least the person who experiences conscious despair is aware that they are sick and searching for a cure. The characters in this novel are attempting to drown their despair in alcohol and sex rather than facing it directly. It gives the novel a very unhealthy feeling that made it difficult for me to read at times. Perhaps that is what Hemingway intended. If so, he definitely succeeded. It is definitely powerful. Still, it reduced my enjoyment of the novel somewhat. The despair in the novel is slightly contagious and I found myself getting sucked into it at times.One final observation and then I will bring this overly long review to a close. Part of my problem with the novel may be my own fault. It is possible I am reading the novel as if it were a nineteenth-century novel. I assume that Hemingway is trying to say something, that he wants the reader to adopt a particular position in relation to his characters, and that might not be the case. I may be assuming too much about the judgments that I think Hemingway wants me to make about his characters, and I tend to disagree with the judgments I think Hemingway wants me to make. For example, I assume that Hemingway approves of Jake's stoicism and disapproves of Cohn's lack of stoicism. Jake suffers silently while Cohn's primary sin seems to be that he is unwilling to suffer silently, to suck it up, so to speak. I do not agree with the values behind that judgment, so if that is the judgment that Hemingway wants the reader to make, it is another reason I did not enjoy the novel more than I did. However, it is possible that Hemingway is not expecting any particular judgments from the reader. Modern novels do not tell the reader what to think in the same way that older novels do. The reader is allowed to make up their own mind. Things happen, and those events effect different characters in particular ways, but there is no God's eye view from which to decide which reactions are ""good"" and which are ""bad"". So, if I could convince myself that Hemingway is simply holding a mirror up to a particular time and place, and leaving it up to the reader to form their own judgments, I would, I think, enjoy the novel much more than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N92R5C8AL3E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743297334#wasThisHelpful","R2N92R5C8AL3E3","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Reynolds has written an accessible and insightful analysis of The Sun Also Rises. In the first chapter Reynolds presents some of the historical context. He draws attention to the effect that World War I had on the value systems of the ""lost generation"". It was no longer possible to believe in honor, glory, or country. Reynolds also draws attention to the conservative climate in America in the 20s. This is important to remember since we tend to have a vision of the 20s as being very fast and loose. There was, however, a very strong conservative strain: prohibition was in effect, the president William Jennings Bryan was opposed to the teaching of evolution in school, the Ku Klux Klan was having huge open rallies and had a real presence on college campuses, and there was a strong movement towards censorship. The Sun Also Rises would have confirmed these conservative views that the current generation was going to pot: awash in sex and alcohol.In the second chapter Reynolds draws attention to the historical importance of the work. Hemingway, along with a few other writers including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, and John Dos Passos really defined American modernism ""They defined what an American novel should look like, how it should be structured, and what its subject matter might be"" (6). Hemingway's use of ironic understatement was also something radically new. The irony and the cynicism of Hemingway's novel have become common place now and no longer shock us but Reynolds points out that they would have been shocking to Hemingway's contemporaries.It is also important that Hemingway does not really tell us what we are supposed to think about these characters or how we are supposed to judge them. Are we supposed to approve of their free-wheeling life-style or is Hemingway presenting them to us as for moral censure? I think this is still difficult for some readers (including me) to deal with. Readers often want to be presented with the author's values in an unambiguous way, they want to be told what to think, and how they should react. It is one of the defining features of the modernist novel that the interpretation is left up to the reader just as it is in real life. For a generation who has lost faith in traditional religion there is no longer any magic book telling us how we are supposed to live. We have to think for ourselves which can be disconcerting.Another hallmark of the modernist novel is the fact that the heroes tend to be passive in relation to greater forces. The characters in Hemingway's novel ""did not want war, did not choose the economic forces that rule their lives, did not choose their psychological problems"" (7). This contrasts with older novels where heroes choose their battles and those battles test their courage, honor, strength, and other positive moral values. Marx and Freud have opened our eyes to the fact that we are often the puppets of hidden forces, economic or psychological, and the modern novel tends to portray its heroes as unwitting victims. Hemingway was one of the pioneers of the modern novel in all of these senses.The third chapter presents a brief history of the critical reception of the work. Many of the first reviewers of the novel were repulsed by the work, the ""pervasive lack of sustaining values"", the fact that there was no admirable hero, and the fact that vice was not punished (9). In some ways we have come a long way since Hemingway's time. Most readers nowadays do not demand that vice be punished. There are exceptions. Certain genres of fiction require that the bad guys get their comeuppance in the end but we have lost faith in the idea of a beneficent world order that rewards the good and punishes the evil. That seems a bit unrealistic to us. However, the fact that there is no admirable hero in the novel and the seeming lack of any sustaining values still turns some readers off. Reynolds also makes a very good point in this chapter when he says that there is no ""correct"" reading of the novel (15). This goes back to the point above: Hemingway does not tell us what to think. That means that the novel winds up being a mirror for our own values. Some people read the novel and admire the life-style depicted and others condemn it. Our reading tells us more about ourselves than it does about the novel itself.In the fourth chapter Reynolds focuses on Jake Barnes who is the narrator of the novel. Reynolds points out rightly that Jake is really the only one changed in the novel. Brett is going to continue having meaningless relationships, Robert Cohn will probably return to Frances or find someone else like her, Mike will continue to drink himself silly, Bill will continue doing what he does, Pedro Romero will continue to fight bulls. We tend to forget how central Jake is to the story because, as a narrator, he tends to withdraw in favor of what he is narrating. However, the central drama of the novel has to do with Jake. Jake is the one who is morally tested. Jake is the one who sells himself out by pimping Brett to Romero. Jake can never go back to Montoya's. He is no longer part of the inner circle of aficions. I really appreciated this insight from Reynolds because until I read it I tended to assume that Robert Cohn's story was the central drama of the novel. I am now convinced that Reynolds is right: the central drama has to do with Jake. The yearly trips to Pamplona meant a lot to him, he failed his moral test, and now his trips to Pamplona will never be the same for him. This is probably what Hemingway meant when he said that the novel was ""a hell of a sad story"". Reynolds also points out how good Hemingway is at clueing us in to Jake's ironic tone. We can often tell the tone of voice of Jake's comments based on the reaction of the other characters.In the fifth chapter Reynolds draws attention to changes that were made to the first draft of the novel that make it more difficult for the reader to pick up on the central conflict of the novel. Originally the novel was going to open with the scene in Pamplona where Jake is sitting in the bar with Brett and Romero and Montoya walks in. Montoya starts to smile at Jake but then sees that he is sitting between Romero, who has a glass of liquor in his hand, and Brett. The novel then flashes back to explain what led to this moment. This makes it clear what the central conflict of the novel is. Hemingway obviously changed the draft which makes it more difficult for the reader to pick out the central conflict. Reynolds also draws attention to the growing tension through the novel that finally explodes in Pamplona (34). This is one of the driving forces in the novel that give it structural unity. Mike, Bill, and Cohn are three bulls who are dangerous and Jake is the steer that calms them (36). However, he cannot contain the conflict forever and it eventually erupts. Reynolds also argues that Romero is not in the novel to present a ""viable model for behavior"" (38). We cannot all run out and become bullfighters. However, Romero has a set of values that sustain him in the face of death. Romero is there to highlight the absence of any set of sustaining values in the other characters.In the sixth chapter Reynolds highlights Hemingway's skills as a travel writer. This explains, I imagine, the appeal the novel has for a lot of people. Hemingway describes Paris, the cafes and the dance clubs, Burguete, the Spanish fishing town on the river, and Pamplona, and the festival of San Fermin, in a way that makes the reader want to visit those places. Even if the reader does not approve of the life-style of the characters in the novel they can still get value out of Hemingway's travel descriptions and advice. In elucidating the historical context Reynolds also points out that the anti-semitism in the book is historically accurate. Reynolds argues we should not shoot the messenger. Hemingway is merely holding a mirror up to his own times.In the seventh chapter Reynolds analyzes the values in the novel or the lack thereof. Reynolds connects the heavy drinking in the novel to the institution of prohibition. Americans went to Paris to drink because they could not drink legally at home. Hemingway is, again, just reflecting the times he lived in. Reynolds also points out that the war destroyed the values of honor and glory once the veterans realized that they were not really fighting to save Western civilization but were instead fighting to make sure the Morgan bank loans to the allies were safe (63). It would be hard not to become cynical if you had been lied to in such a way. Reynolds also highlights the fact that money, or the ""simple exchange of values"", is the only real value operative in the novel. Everyone tries to get their money's worth. Reynolds points out that ""The Sun Also Rises is not a guide to reasonable behavior. It is not a song in praise of the so-called lost generation. It is a thorough moral examination of its time. If the results are offensive, we can not blame the doctor who conducted the exam"" (64)In the eight chapter Reynolds draws attention to a number of signs that the attentive reader should pay attention to when reading the novel. Reynolds points out that signs change and there are a lot of signs in the novel that would have been understood to Hemingway's contemporaries that no longer make sense to a modern reader. Reynolds analyzes a number of signs: the importance of money, bathing, and time among them. In the final chapter, which is only a page long, Reynolds claims that ""Despite its irony and its sadness, we walk away from The Sun Also Rises with a good feeling"" (95). I am not as convinced of that as Reynolds seems to be. Reading the novel left me with sort of a sick feeling. However, Reynolds makes a good point when he claims that ""So long as we do not approve of the 'simple exchange of values,' then we know higher standards of behavior exist"". We might not know what those higher standards of behavior are, but our rejection of a morality based solely on money, is a sign that we are holding out for something better. That is something, I guess.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CB2WKBS0QB6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805779620#wasThisHelpful","R3CB2WKBS0QB6C","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a collection of critical essays on Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Like all essay collections some of the essays were more interesting than others. There is another collection of essays, edited by Harold Bloom, that makes a nice complement to this collection: The Sun Also Rises (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations). There are two overlaps between the volumes. I will provide a short summary of the essays I read for the interested reader.""The Difference Between France and Spain"" - Delbert E. Wylder. Wylder's main thesis is that there is a contrast operating in the novel between France, and its materialistic values, and Spain, and its more spiritual values, and Jake is caught in the middle between the two. He points out a number of places where this contrast operates: the tip that Brett gives Jake's concierge versus the tip that Jake attempts to give to a Spanish waitress, the owner of Madame Lecomte, who knows Bill but cannot get him a table, versus Montoya who saves rooms for his favorite guests, and the contrast between the national sports (bicycle racing versus bullfighting). Wylder argues that ""Neither country provides an easy answer to the problem of living one's life"" but Jake is clearly drawn towards the Spain side of the equation.""Jake 'Wins' in Spain at the End of the Sun Also Rises"" - Donald A. Daiker. Daiker's main thesis is that the final scene of the book, Jake and Brett in Madrid, represents Jake's final triumph over Brett. Daiker offers an interesting analysis of Jake's time in San Sebastien. He argues that Jake is in need of cleansing after he pimps Brett out to Romero and his trip to San Sebastien is a kind of moral purification. Jake diving with his eyes open is a symbol for his probing of the depths of his inner self (44). After Jake encounters the nurses, and the wounded soldier, the water is rougher, a symbol of his emotions which are more intense since the encounter reminds him of how he met Brett, but he is able to master his emotions through his swim. He is, therefore, prepared to face Brett, and achieve his independence. Daiker also offers a detailed analysis of the final scene and illustrates how Jake and Brett's positions have been systematically reversed from what they were at the beginning of the book.""The Character of Robert Cohn"" - Robert E. Meyerson. Meyerson argues that the other characters resent Cohn because of his remaining idealism, the fact that he was untouched by the war, and the fact that, as a Jew, he occupies the position of ""sufferer"" which is a position they want for themselves. One of the most interesting insights from this essay is Meyerson's insight that ""attitudes towards Cohn rise and fall according to the health and welfare of those around him"" (67). Cohn is sort of a moral barometer for the other characters. When they are feeling good, they treat him well, when they are feeling lousy, they start to treat him poorly, and they tend to lapse into anti-Semitism.""In Defense of Brett"" - Roger Whitlow. Whitlow attempts to defend Brett from the standard critical appraisals which tend to criticize Brett for not being ""womanly"" or for being a b****. Whitlow argues that one must take into consideration the milieu she existed in and points out that she is never cruel. She is also far more self-destructive than she is destructive of those around her. Also, Cohn, Jake, Mike, and Romero are all partly to blame for the destructive effect that she has on them. I was glad to see Brett defended. She was actually one of the only characters in the novel that I felt sympathetic towards. She seems more like a wounded soul than an uncaring destructive force to me. She is the kind of lost soul that men have a tendency to fall in love with in the hopes of saving. I do not think it is really her fault that she disappoints those hopes.""Alcoholism in The Sun Also Rises"" - Matts Dios. Dios argues that alcoholism turns all the characters in the novel into manipulative self-loathing wrecks incapable of love or friendship. Liquor also keeps their lives in a constant state of disorder and obscures their spiritual bankruptcy. Personally, I really enjoyed this essay. I have to admit, I did not actually enjoy reading The Sun Also Rises very much (I have read it twice and did not really enjoy it much either time), and I got these essays in the hopes that they might make a convert out of me. I think Dios' essay highlighted some of the reasons I did not like the book. Dios points out that the novel ""is a portrait of a bankrupt value system that depends far too much on appearances and dramatics"". I think part of the reason the novel did not work for me is because I do not think that Hemingway necessarily intended that. If he had intended to portray a bunch of codependent alcoholics who were spiritually bankrupt it could have been an interesting novel.I think Hemingway does see a bankruptcy of spiritual values in his characters but he does not see the connection with alcoholism. So, bullfighting becomes the big spiritual savior. Romero, the bullfighter, is independent and does not rely on women for his sense of self-worth. However, as Dios points out the ""intense need for personal power"" is itself a sign of alcoholism. In other words, it seems to me that Hemingway's ""cure"" for the spiritual bankruptcy of his characters is, ultimately, merely a symptom of the real disease operating in the novel. I think that is, perhaps, why I do not like the novel very much. It is sick all the way through. There is no sign of health in it. The one sign of health might be nature. The fishing trip is as close to genuine health as the novel gets but, even there, Jake and Bill are constantly drunk. If Hemingway had intended the novel to be a portrait of the lost generation I think I would like the novel more, but he consciously disavowed that reading of the novel. He believed it was a moral novel and many commentators agree. Dios, on the other hand, seems to see the ""code"" or the ""moral backbone"" of the novel as a mere symptom of alcoholism. That is probably a bit too simplistic but there is a lot of truth to it as well.""Money in The Sun Also Rises"" - Patrick D. Morrow. Morrow argues that where a character gets his or her money is a key to their moral character. Money is the moral dimension of the novel and money is circular since ""more money ensures that the 'entertaining' circular movement of life without purpose can continue"" (125). Morrow also highlights the various roles that money plays throughout the novel: it is a means to buy and control friendship (125), it is a measure of artistic success (125), and it is a way of making up for one's weaknesses (126-127).""Social Class in The Sun Also Rises"" - Marc D. Baldwin. Baldwin attempts to analyze the class consciousness of the various characters in the novel. This is an interesting dimension to the novel that is definitely present. For example, Frances Clyne perceives Paris to be clean, while the prostitute Georgette finds it terribly dirty (136). This shows the different perceptions that arise from different class consciousnesses. Baldwin also points out that the characters with the most social class in the novel (Brett and Mike) are the biggest free-loaders (139). While I think there is a lot that could be done in analyzing the class consciousness in the novel, and I am sympathetic to Marxist criticism some of the time, I do not think that Baldwin's Marxist reading of The Sun Also Rises is all that convincing in many of its details.""The 1920s and The Sun Also Rises"" - Michael Reynolds. Reynolds argues that it is important to understand the historical context of the novel when interpreting it and he attempts to correct some misconceptions about the 20s. Reynolds points out that our standard views about the ""roaring 20s"" and the ""Jazz Age"" are somewhat misleading. The 20s were actually a very conservative time when many Americans were worried about new sexual mores, the spread of ""black music"", and the rising Jew. There was a lot of bigotry and racism. There was also a rise in rampant consumerism. Reynolds points out that people living in the 20s would read the novel very differently than we do today. Brett, and her promiscuity, for example, would have represented everything that the conservatives thought was wrong with the 20s, sexual freedom, the degeneration of society, the collapse of family values (sound familiar?). Reynolds also interestingly points out that in 1925 the exchange rate between the U.S. and France was 1:26 at a time when half a franc bought a mug of beer. That means that expatriates could live in Paris on the cheap. Americans started flooding into Paris and that shows up at a few points in the novel.""Hemingway's Writer's in The Sun Also Rises"" - Robert E. Fleming. Unfortunately, I did not take very good notes on this essay, but I know that Fleming argues that Cohn represents all that is wrong with the writer in Hemingway's mind (160-161). Hemingway believed that the writer should write what they truly felt rather than what they thought they were supposed to feel. It is hard to disagree with that. Cohn, however, ""spends his time parroting the lessons he has been taught about how he should feel"". I am not sure how Fleming knows that or reaches that conclusion but it is an interesting essay.""The Art of Repetition in The Sun Also Rises"" - E. Miller Budick. Budick argues that the novel is made of repetitions (with a difference) but they are bad repetitions based largely on Jake's lack of self-awareness. He gets himself into the same situations over and over with Brett because he does not understand himself and he represses that self-knowledge. Budick does believe that by the end of the novel Jake has gained in self-awareness and has altered his relationship with Brett. This essay reminds me of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and his book Difference and Repetition. Deleuze argues that there are good repetitions, based on the affirmation of difference, and bad repetitions, based on repression. I think it could be said that Jake is trapped in bad repetitions when the novel begins but is able to free himself to some degree by the end when he repeats his drive with Brett. I actually think that all novels should be about growth in self-awareness and I think The Sun Also Rises fits that pattern.""Narration in The Sun Also Rises"" - Terrence Doody. This essay had a really interesting subject but I had a hard time following it in certain sections. Doody attempts to analyze the fact that The Sun Also Rises is written as first-person narration. Jake is the one speaking and he is not a purely objective observer. Jake changes as the novel progresses and Jake's style of narration changes. There is a tension, however, because, in order to maintain the immediacy of Hemingway's narrative style, Jake cannot be seen to purposely change his style, or see or narrate the changes in himself. If Jake were to ""solicit an audience, or commit his perceptual experience and moral education to a formal mode"" he would be ""violating Hemingway's code"". Doody seems to think that Hemingway did not adequately resolve this dilemma. Doody writes that ""Hemingway does not realize what he is doing to Jake because he has not thought out the first person novel and its demands with enough care"" (195). This is a really interesting subject but, like I said, I am not sure I totally followed the essay, and I am not even sure that my summary is entirely accurate to what Doody intended.There are also six essays in the book that I did not read (actually, one of them I read, Spilka's essay, but I read it when I read Bloom's collection, and the reader can find my thoughts about it under my review of that volume). The essays I did not read were ""Paris and the Characters of The Sun Also Rises"" by David Morgan Zehr, ""Confused Chronology in The Sun Also Rises"" by J.F. Kobler, ""The Primitive Emotion That Drives Jake Barnes"" by Ernest Lockridge, ""Good Old Harris in The Sun Also Rises"" by Jane E. Wilson, ""The Death of Love in The Sun Also Rises"" by Mark Spilka, and ""Humor in The Sun Also Rises"" by James Hinkle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNRGW6HNIBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0737701951#wasThisHelpful","RZNRGW6HNIBL","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing to be said is, if you are looking for Ernest Hemingway's novel, The Sun Also Rises, go here:The Sun Also Rises. This book is a collection of critical essays. There are five reviews here. Four of them are for the novel, and one of them is for Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire. In other words, none of the reviews on this page are reviews of the actual book, so the reader should be aware of what they are getting. Amazon has a tendency to mix up the listings a bit so I have a feeling that reviewers may have been confused by earlier listings. It is also quite confusing that Ernest Hemingway is listed as the editor for this volume. Hemingway had absolutely nothing to do with this volume other than the fact that he wrote the novel which is the subject of the critical essays. If you are at this page now, and you order this book, you are going to get a collection of critical essays, edited by Harold Bloom, about The Sun Also Rises, NOT the novel itself. I wanted to make that clear at the start so no one wastes money ordering a book they do not want.All in all, I thought there were some interesting essays in this book. The Bloom volumes in this series are hit and miss. Some are quite good, and some are quite bad. This one seems to me to be in the middle. I should be upfront and say that I do not actually like The Sun Also Rises very much. I read this collection of essays partly hoping that they would convert me. I thought perhaps I was missing the themes of the novel and that if I understood the novel better I might appreciate it more. The essays certainly highlighted a lot of things that I had missed but I cannot say that they succeeded in converting me into a Hemingway fan. In the rest of my review I will give a brief summary of the essays that I have read (all but two) for the interested reader. These summaries are really more ""highlights"" than actual summaries. I am a little too lazy to try to pick out the main thesis in each essay, explain it, present the evidence, etc., so I have simply highlighted what I think are the most important, or most interesting, themes highlighted in each essay.""Introduction"" by Harold Bloom - Bloom's introduction is short and, I have to admit, I do not really like Harold Bloom. Bloom tends to be obsessed with two things, 1) literary influence, and 2) ranking books in terms of their place in the literary pantheon. The question of literary influence can be interesting but Bloom's introductions to these volumes tend towards meaningless lists. Bloom claims that Hemingway's ""peculiar excellence is closer to Whitman than to Twain, closer to Stevens than to Faulkner, and even closer to Eliot than to Fitzgerald"" (2) (you get the feeling he put in the last one just to be a contrarian). That is the kind of statement, and analysis, that seems almost useless to me. The attempt to rank works in terms of the pantheon is, in my opinion, even more useless. The job of the critic should be to explain why a work is valuable or interesting. Whether it is the ""best"" or ""one of the three best"" is a useless question, and history will decide what works will survive and which will not. Most of Bloom's short introductory essay is related to these rather useless questions. However, he does have some interesting things to say about Hemingway's style ""Hemingway evokes by parataxis...a way of utterance that plays at a withdrawal from all affect, while actually investing affect in the constancy of the withdrawal"" (6). Bloom draws attention to Hemingway's use of understatement and points out that style is a ""metaphor for a particular attitude towards reality"" (6). Bloom should have left out all the ranking and influence stuff and focused on developing those insights a bit more.""The Wastelanders"" by Carlos Baker. Carlos Baker critiques the standard interpretation of the novel as a portrait of the ""lost generation"". People tend to focus on the first epigraph, a quote from Gertrude Stein, and ignore the second, a quote from Ecclesiastes. According to Baker readers have mistakenly supposed the quote from Stein to represent Hemingway's own views, but according to Hemingway himself, Stein's quote about the lost generation was ""a piece of 'splendid bombast'"" (13). For Baker there is a ""sturdy moral backbone"" to the novel represented by the trio Barnes-Bill-Romero. They contrast favorably with the sick trio Cohn-Brett-Mike. Baker sees the moral norm of the book as a ""healthy and almost boyish innocence of spirit"". It is hard for me to see that represented in Barnes or Bill. In fact, I think Cohn comes closer to representing ""boyish innocence"" than Barnes or Bill. He is the least cynical of the characters. Barnes himself claims that Cohn had a ""nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness"". In other words, I am not sure I buy Baker's analysis of the moral backbone of the novel. I think there probably is a moral backbone in the novel but I think it is probably related to two things, 1) closeness to nature (as in the fishing trip), and 2) bullfighting, which seems to represent Hemingway's own moral ideal.""The Death of Love in The Sun Also Rises"" - Mark Spilka. Spilka sees a stoic ethic operating in the novel (26). Anyone who ""bears his sickness well"" like Barnes is viewed in a positive light, while those who are unable to bear their suffering silently, like Cohn, are viewed in an unfavorable light. There does seem to be an ethic of self-control operating in the book. Romero comes closest to representing Hemingway's moral ideal and bullfighting seems to represent the ability to remain composed in the face of danger. Romero does not let the Romantic entanglements with Brett and Cohn get in the way of his performance in the bullfighting ring. That seems to be Hemingway's ideal. Barnes attempts to mimic that ideal with less success. He lets his misery spill out at times. Personally, this ethic of self-control is one of the things I do not like about the novel but I have no doubt it is there. Spilka also argues that Cohn is the ""last defender of an outworn faith"" in Romantic love. All the other characters have been disillusioned by their experiences in the war (a number of characters, including Brett, lost loved ones in the war). This is one reason the other characters seem to look down on Cohn.""Implications of Form in The Sun Also Rises"" - William L. Vance. Vance's essay is one of my two favorite essays in the book. Vance argues that the novel is a mix between a naturalistic and an Aristotelian narrative structure. The naturalistic structure is based on repetition while the Aristotelian is a linear plot driven by the conscious actions of the characters. All the characters except for Cohn, according to Vance, follow a repetitive pattern. They go out to dinner, get drunk, go to bed, and repeat. Brett has one love affair after another. Each love affair is an isolated episode without any greater meaning. Cohn, on the other hand, still believes in the standard love story arc. Cohn's story, therefore, has a beginning, middle, and end, and is set off against the repetitive background of the rest of the character's lives. Vance argues that Cohn's ""view of life is at least worth considering as an option to theirs"" (42). Vance recognizes, I think rightly, that Cohn is not merely an object of contempt. There are admirable qualities in Cohn. In modern terms we could say that Cohn still believes in the fairy tale ending while the rest of the characters can no longer believe in that. We might agree that Cohn's views are idealistic and unrealistic, however, far from presenting a positive alternative to Cohn's illusions, Vance argues that ""The cynicism, bitterness, and self-pity of the point of view of those who have given up hardly recommend it to the reader either"" (48). I think that is an important point. It seems to me that the novel represents a certain disillusionment but offers nothing positive in its place. The illusions of Romantic love might be over but I do not think that an ethic based on bullfighting can make up for the void left by the death of traditional values, meanings, narratives, etc.. Hemingway might have believed it could, but I think he was wrong if he did.""Ernest Hemingway and the Rhetoric of Escape"" - Robert O. Stephens. Stephens believes that there is a distinction operating in the novel between ""the truly questing escapist and the pseudo-expatriate"" (52). The true escapist is attempting to escape an intolerable situation ""He escapes to another situation to find a more tolerable experience"". The true escapists can no longer tolerate traditional values. They are pragmatists who are trying to figure out how best to live in the world, as Jake says ""I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it"". The true escapists are also aware of ""nada"" which is ""the knowledge that social values"" and ""personal beliefs in immortality...have been seriously damaged by the war"" (53). While all the true escapists are aware of nada, they cannot speak of it directly. This gives rise to a lot of the indirect forms of communication used in the novel. Stephens offers some interesting analyses of these indirect means of communication that makes the essay certainly worth reading.""Meyer Wolfsheim and Robert Cohn: A Study of a Jewish Type and Stereotype"" - Josephine Z. Knopf. This is one of the essays I did not read so I cannot summarize it.""Hemingway's Morality of Compensation"" - Scott Donaldson. Donaldson sees a moral economy operating in the novel similar to Emily Dickinson's ""For each extatic instant/We must an anguish pay"". Some characters, like Barnes, pay for their joys through hard work, others, like Cohn and Brett, receive inheritances they did not work for, or let other people pay their way, and wind up racking up a negative balance, which has to get payed for eventually in suffering. The world, apparently, does not give anything for free. Donaldson seems to see a kind of karmic metaphysics operating in the novel.""The End of The Sun Also Rises: A New Beginning"" - Carole Gottlieb Vopat. Vopat attempts to argue that there is real development in Jake. He is not the same person at the end of the novel as he was in the beginning. He is no longer willing to be a mere puppet in Brett's games. He has achieved a new status of independence and self-respect. She offers a nice little analysis of the scene where Jake comes to see Brett in her hotel room in Madrid at the end of the novel, and she claims, rightly, I think, that at the end of the novel, Jake and Brett ""no longer feed off the same fantasies and illusions"" (100). That is a nice way of putting it. She also draws meaning out of Jake's time in San Sebastien and claims that Jake is afraid to ""become involved with life, with Brett, with emotions, as bullfighters can...He is afraid of drowning in the open sea, of facing the bull head-on rather than vicariously, of a love affair, of women, of his unconscious, of a life without limits"" (96). Rather than a negative character trait, however, Vopat sees in this a humble recognition of his own limits. Perhaps that is another reason I do not like the novel very much. Cohn is the one who is willing to take a risk, and risk looking like a fool, while Jake seems more concerned with how he will look, than he is about pursuing what he wants. That, to me, is cowardly, not stoic. For me, Cohn is closer to having the right attitude, but most commentators tend to see Cohn as the object of Hemingway's critique. I think Hemingway and I have dramatically different values. Vopat's essay does do a good job analyzing the character of Jake and is worth reading.""The Sun Also Rises: One Debt to Imagism"" - Linda W. Wagner. Wagner argues that Hemingway took many of Ezra Pound's suggestions about good prose to heart. Present things directly, use words sparingly, avoid abstractions, etc.. Jake presents things directly with very little interpretation. The reader is left to interpret the emotions. For example, when Brett hangs her head during Mike and Robert's verbal repartee. Jake does not add ""She hung her head in desperation, or sadness, etc."" He just presents it directly and it highlights the changing relationships which, Wagner claims, are the real subject of the book. Not a lot happens in the novel in terms of plot but the relationships shift. These shifting relationships are often dramatized through subtle body language or changes in behavior (drinking more than usual, etc.). Hemingway also avoids abstraction ""Love, hate, grief, religion, death, fear - these are the prime movers of the novel, yet the words scarcely appear"" (111). Again, Hemingway presents love in concrete details. He does not present a grand abstraction called ""Love"". There are different kinds of love, and different ways of loving, and the different characters represent those different kinds of loving directly.""False Dawn: The Sun Also Rises Manuscript"" - Michael S. Reynolds. Reynolds presents a short history of the text of The Sun Also Rises. He presents some of the alternate titles Hemingway toyed with, and analyzes some of the early drafts, and the later changes that Hemingway made. This is all quite interesting and helpful in teasing out Hemingway's intentions.""What's Funny in The Sun Also Rises"" - James Hinkle. This is the other essay I did not read but I gather than Hinkle is attempting to highlight the jokes in The Sun Also Rises that he thinks most readers often miss.""Toreo: The Moral Axis of The Sun Also Rises"" - Allen Josephs. This is the other of my two favorite essays in the book. Josephs believes that bullfighting is the spiritual core of the novel. The Fiesta in Pamplona is a religious festival which represents a move from mundane to sacred time and bullfighting is a relic of ancient sacrifice which connects us with the universe in a quasi-mystical way. Hemingway himself describes bullfighting in these terms at times. There is an interesting mixture of the pagan (animal sacrifice) and the Christian (San Fermin) in the Pamplona festival. Barnes seems to have more of a connection to the pagan. He goes to the church but he does not really feel it. When he is at the bullfighting ring, however, he feels it. It is an emotional, and religious, experience for him. According to Josephs, Hemingway's ""exaltation of the pristine savagery of the plaza de torso was tantamount to Hemingway's embracing an ancient mystery and iconoclastically rejecting much of what passed for modern Western values"" (153). There is also an interesting quote from a letter that Hemingway wrote where Hemingway compares James Joyce to the bullfighter Maera ""There is absolutely no comparison in art between Joyce and Maera - Maera by a mile"" (153). Hemingway, apparently, thought that the bullfighter was more of an artist than Joyce. This probably goes a long way in explaining why I do not like the novel. I could not disagree more. Still, Josephs essay is very interesting, and quite enlightening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TBKPQVW7593/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555460453#wasThisHelpful","R23TBKPQVW7593","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be hard to imagine a more apt epigraph for Roberto Bolano's ambitious novel, 2666, than the one Bolano himself chose: ""An oasis of horror in a desert of boredom"".The line is from Charles Baudelaire and it manages to sum up the novel in a single sentence. The poet T.S. Eliot believed that Charles Baudelaire's depictions of ennui, and the horrors of modern life, were like the photographic negatives of a more positive, mystical, and beatific vision. In his essay on Baudelaire Eliot writes ""the sense of Evil implies the sense of good"" and ""such suffering as Baudelaire's implies the possibility of a positive state of beatitude"". In past ages the beatific vision was presented directly and in positive terms. Writers celebrated the signs of God's Providence in nature and history. The whole world seemed to sing the praises of God and provide evidence of His Glory. T.S. Eliot was as aware as anyone that the time for such positive visions was over. The modern world that Eliot himself depicts in his poems is a wasteland and the negative vision is all we have left of the mystical after the ""death of God"". We no longer see the providence of God in the indifference and violence of nature, and even if there is progress in history, something that is doubtful to say the least, the progress comes at the price of a great deal of waste and human suffering. Countless innocent lives are sacrificed to the march of history, some of them are sacrificed nobly on behalf of great causes, but many are simply the victims of the mundane realities of city life and mental illness.There are a number of modern writers who seem to me to present the reader with a negative vision of a God-forsaken world, a kind of modern day mystical vision, or substitute for the old visions of God's grandeur. What the writers I am thinking of have in common is not simply the unflinching portrayal of the darker side of life but the belief that an honest look at the darker side of life is capable of providing some metaphysical insight into the nature of reality. Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West, by Cormac McCarthy, is a novel that presents such a vision and, it seems to me, 2666 is another. 2666 does not have a unified narrative structure, but the novel is centered around a series of rapes and murders that take place in the Mexican border town of Santa Teresa and, the narrator claims, even though ""no one pays attention to these killings...the secret of the world is hidden in them"". The brutal and senseless murders that are the focal point of Bolano's novel are the aperture through which the metaphysical nature of reality is revealed, just as, in previous ages, writer's believed they could read the secrets of God's Providence from the interlocking purposes of nature.The novel itself is long, at times frustrating, and composed of five separate, but interrelated, movements. 'The Part About the Critics' tells the story of four literary critics devoted to the work of an obscure German author named Benno von Archimboldi. After hearing a rumor that Archimboldi has been spotted in the Mexican border town of Santa Teresa three of the critics set off in pursuit. 'The Part About Amalfitano' follows the story of a philosophy professor, who lives in Santa Teresa with his daughter Rosa, and is slowly losing his mind. 'The Part About Fate' is about a newspaper reporter who is in Santa Teresa to cover a boxing match but winds up becoming interested in the murders taking place in the city. 'The Part About the Murders' interweaves the stories of a number of Santa Teresa detectives with endless newspaper like reports of the murders. 'The Part About Archimboldi' moves back in time to tell the life story of the German author Benno von Archimboldi, whose real name is Hans Reiter, including his experiences in World War II as a soldier for the German army.The five parts of the novel are related through what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein would have called ""family resemblances"". Just as the facial resemblances between family members pass from a similar nose here, to a similar chin there, without there being a single facial feature that is common to all members of the same family, so too, the parts of this novel are related through a recurring character here, and a different recurring character or setting there, without there being a single unifying story to tie them all together into a whole. There is no Ur-story or meta-narrative operating in Bolano's world, perhaps another sign of our Godless post-modern condition. The first section is related to the second through the character of Amalfitano, who appears in both, and to the fifth through the character of Archimboldi. The second is related to the third through Rosa, and the fourth section is related to all of the others through the town of Santa Teresa. The fifth is connected to the first through Archimboldi, and the third and fourth through Klaus Haas. If beauty is the perception of form, or integral wholeness, then there is no beauty in Bolano's 2666, but, it seems to me to be another distinguishing characteristic of modern writing to try to find beauty in what is ugly, senseless, and disjointed, and, I think, Bolano is as successful as any other modern writer in doing so.Like a Mandlebrot set, the same fracture that is present in the novel as a whole is also present in the parts, though to a lesser degree. Each individual section is unified by the presence of a dominant story line and cast of characters but Bolano is fond of the digression. He spends pages introducing minor characters, giving their life histories, and then never returns to them again. Along the way we meet a painter who cuts off his own hand and includes it as part of one of his paintings, a mad poet who lives in an insane asylum, and a Romanian Jew who goes to fight for the Bolsheviks, and then, presumably, is killed by the Nazis. Those are just a few of the interesting characters that people Bolano's tome. When, late in the novel, a character says, referring to the writings of Archimboldi, ""The writing was clear and sometimes even transparent, but the way that the stories followed one after another didn't lead anywhere"", it is pretty clear that this is a self-conscious and self-referential literary gesture on Bolano's part. Bolano is a skilled writer, he is skilled at creating full blooded characters with the stroke of a pen, and skilled at creating interesting back stories that generally hold the reader's attention, but the digressions, after almost 900 pages, get a bit tedious.The murders that are the focal point of the story are narrated in a very matter of fact way. Facts are given about each killing including, the age and name of the victim, their occupation, the manner and approximate time of death. Sometimes Bolano fills in the back story a bit but, for the most part, we are given nothing but the bare facts of the case. By turning to the holocaust in the final section of the novel Bolano sets up a contrast that I think is important between the murders in Santa Teresa and the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis. They are both examples of senseless violence but the holocaust has become a part of our grand historical narrative in a way that more everyday murders like those in Santa Teresa have not. We have monuments honoring the victims of the holocaust, history museums to keep their memories alive, and there are first person accounts documenting the horrors of the concentration camps. The stories that Bolano chooses to tell in this novel are stories that are rarely told. We do not have any monuments honoring the dead of Ciudad-Juarez, or any museums keeping their memory alive (the fictional city of Santa Teresa is based on Ciudad-Juarez).Humans have a well documented affinity for narrative which seems to be rooted in our brains and nervous systems. Narrative seems to be one of the primary ways that we make sense of the world and, as senseless and horrific as the holocaust was, we seem to have succeeded in constructing a narrative about the holocaust that is capable of making some sense out of it. Even if the ultimate motivations driving the perpetrators of the holocaust remains a mystery as dark as any mystery in the universe, we at least know who to blame. The murders that Bolano's novel documents fall outside of history because they are deemed too unimportant and, therefore, they are never integrated into our sense making activities. They are also mostly unsolved which makes it difficult to assign blame. The murders remain genuinely senseless and unintegrated. We have no place for them in the stories we tell ourselves. In 2666 Bolano has attempted to make a novel, a form of writing that is tied essentially to narrative, out of something that resists our usual narrative activities. That fact, I think, goes a long way towards explaining the narrative fragmentation of the novel. It also explains why the murders are ""the secret of the world"" and are able to serve as an aperture, allowing us to see through the arbitrary nature of our standard, everyday cognitive constructs. The murders are just one more ignored hint that the meaning we impose on the world is secondary revision and rationalization through and through. Writers in past ages attempted to see through the seeming chaos of the world to perceive the divine order operating in it, while modern writers, Bolano included, attempt to see past the order that we impose on the world in order to perceive the senseless chaos underneath.Madness is another recurring theme in the novel and it fits with this theme nicely. In our modern Godless world madness is, perhaps, the closest we get to hearing the voice of the divine, or at least the voice of something other than our banal reason. Madness also reveals to us the arbitrary nature of our standard cognitive constructs. Madness breaks through our standard sense making activities and shows us the chaos rumbling beneath our feet. It is also possible that madness is the appropriate response in a mad world where hundreds of brutal murders are considered business as usual. The artists in Bolano's novel almost invariably go mad and they all seem to be conspicuously devoid of any redeeming vision for humanity. It has been a common place among intellectuals to look to artists for salvation from our self-inflicted miseries but, in Bolano's world, the cries of the artists are as senseless as the world that created them. They are poisonous flowers blooming in the desert.2666 is a well conceived artistic vision but, ultimately, it is equal parts fascinating and frustrating. There are at least three things that are responsible for the reader's frustration. First, the novel builds slowly to a climax in the fourth section. The murders are hinted at in the first three sections and then become the subject of the fourth. The reader is drawn into the mystery and is aching for some kind of resolution, preferably, one that would tie all the pieces of the novel together. The reader feels as if they are being led to a kind of climax for the first 600+ pages of the book, and then, suddenly, after the fourth section, the novel jumps back 70 years, and it never really gets back to where the story left off in the fourth section. The story of Hans Reiter is an interesting story, it would have made a fascinating stand alone novel, but it is marred by the fact that the reader is eager to get back to the killings in Santa Teresa, which take place in the 1990s, but is, instead, stuck back in the 1940s for most of the section. Second, the digressions get tedious for the same reason. All of the side stories that Bolano tells would be fascinating stories on their own, but the reader begins to feel like they are merely distractions from the central mystery. That makes reading the novel a chore at times. Third, there is, ultimately, no real resolution to the mystery. Bolano's novel, like life, leaves the reader face to face with the mystery of existence. That was the right choice on Bolano's part. Any ""solution"" to the mystery would seem puerile. Even if we were told who the perpetrators of the murders were would that make them any less mysterious? Would knowing who the perpetrators were silence our questions about the nature of evil or the senselessness of violence? Would assigning names to the murderers answer any of our questions about the meaning, or meaninglessness, of life and death? There is no ""solution"", each local solution merely hides a more general problem, but knowing that fact does not make it any less frustrating.If you can deal with the frustration, and you have time and emotional energy to devote to an ambitious novel, 2666 is worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19RT1WBGS0YC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312429215#wasThisHelpful","R19RT1WBGS0YC4","A1KE3JBO3KQX2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE3JBO3KQX2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading Stranger in a Strange Land (SSL) and Moon is a Harsh Mistress, I am done with Heinlein.  These are both his best-known works among the general population, and I found both too dated and preachy.  Summary of SSL:The Good:- The first part of the book is a fast-paced political & sci-fi thriller about the intrigues surrounding a human raised on Mars, who is heir to various valuable interests- Strong emphasis on mind over matter; the main character and later his disciples can will various things into happening, including healing themselves, telekinesis, etc- Emphasis on sexual liberation, esp. multiple partners and plural marriage, seems to have ignited or provided fuel to the 1960s sexual revolution; in fact, I came across references to this book in a biography of Playboy's Hugh Hefner, which is how I ended up reading SSLThe Bad:- The second part of the book, after the protagonist's political and financial matters are taken care of, turns into a slow-motion and slightly weird exploration of humanity and the creation of a sex-based cult -- apparently Heinlein wrote the book in two parts after years of hiatus- As others pointed out too, all the male characters are very smug and know full well how life should be lived - especially Jubal- The rare scenes in ""heaven"" are intended to be funny but are also completely illogical given the mockery of religion in the rest of the book- The pseudo-Christian ending is not logically connected to what comes right before it -- besides serving the need to end the book- What is Jubal's real lifestyle and background? Initially it looked like he might be a Hefner-style playboy living in a rural mansion. Yet later in the book he discusses women with Ben, and it becomes clear that his relations with his young and beautiful secretaries (who swim in the nude at all times of the day) are non-sexual, and yet it is not obvious why they are with him (not money, as he himself says) and are as intelligent and good-looking as they are. Sounds like Jubal is the author's own vision of how he wanted to live in his own old age.- If you want to read about plural marriage or other non-monogamous practices, this book is not a good source -- things in SSL happen because the protagonist wills them to be. To the extent that people in the past and today have practiced such lifestyles, it is best to refer to non-fiction to learn more.The Ugly:- Strange non-sequiturs like ""9 out of 10 times a woman gets raped it is her fault"".  Muslim scientist nicknamed ""Stinky"".- Patriarchal. Women are bossed around and second-class citizens like I guess they were in the 1950s. Watch Mad Men instead.For the record, I read the unabridged author's version.  Not the edited and shorter first printing.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KW6O0CA8884/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441788386#wasThisHelpful","R17KW6O0CA8884","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this book. The author's untimely end, as well as his childhood and early life, remind me of some of my relatives. So there were things I could identify with.However, I did not learn anything at the end, nor was the book entertaining. Yes, an early death could and does happen, seemingly without reason; that I knew even before opening this book. Yes, cancer is normally unforgiving. The author seems to have had a great life. Too much is left unsaid though, and he is not enough of a fascinating public figure. Just a baby boomer executive who was lucky enough to get rich.Overall it feels like this book was a vanity project, a long self-eulogy. If the author / protagonist really wanted to write it for his family, he could have used another medium and instilled in it more wisdom than this book contains.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8N0SELPHDR03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579546889#wasThisHelpful","R8N0SELPHDR03","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have worked at Google in the past, so a lot of what Laszlo describes is familiar to me (hiring, performance evaluations, benefits) and the way these things evolved over time look very plausible to me.  Google is a fantastic company and Laszlo Bock has done a great job describing the HR side of it.Depending on your own experience with hiring, management, and culture-building within modern tech companies, the book could come across as common-sense good practices or revolutionary.Insights from the book:- Invest HR budget first in recruiting- Don't let hiring managers make the hiring decisions; let an impartial committee review each candidate to enforce a high bar and have a meaningful discussion about the pros and cons of each candidate- Hire only the best, strive to find people better than you in some meaningful way- Find (source) your candidates; job boards are not a good source of talent- Do performance reviews using peer feedback and use committees to calibrate grades and promotions across teams- Split rewards conversations (say, annual performance bonuses) from development conversations (more frequent feedback on performance)- Research what your best people do well and how they do it, and try to extract their experience in the form of checklists and good practices- Have your best people teach others- Pay ""unfairly"" since the best performers (esp. in technology) deliver orders of magnitude more value than average workers- Run small experiments with various processes- Trust your people, be transparent- There are great perks which build good culture and they don't cost much (the author describes many that Google offers)- Be data driven in your HR decisions- Instead of traditional HR people, strive to also hire people with business operations (e.g. management consultants) and analytics (statistics etc) backgrounds in the HR teamThe downsides of the book :- It is aimed primarily at HR practitioners, in my opinion; so this is not a book on how to be a better manager per se- It is a little dry to read, and there aren't good examples; the author stays a little too abstract (I wonder if he did not want to share specific examples of ""unfair"" wide disparities in compensation, or examples of how a hiring committee operates with real candidates, etc, which would have been very interesting to see)- The author is a little too proud of Google (don't get me wrong, Google is awesome, but sometimes the tone gets too boastful)- Laszlo's pyramid of HR, akin to Maslow's pyramid of needs, is somewhat weird towards the end (""where are the fries I didn't order?"")Overall I found Eric Schmidt's How Google Works to be a better and more relevant book if you are interested in general management and how to build a high-performance culture.  Eric Schmidt also talks about hiring, transparency, setting goals, and so on.  I find Laszlo Bock's book a little too HR-nerdy :)Recommended with some reservations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0ZZ5M1R526E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554790#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0ZZ5M1R526E","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It had been years since I bought a Swiss Army knife (SAK). I wanted to give one as a gift, and I thought which one would have all the essentials, including being able to open wine at home, open beer, adjust our eyebrows with tweezers, fix things up with an impromptu screwdriver, cut cheese for that wine we just opened, and trim things with the scissors?  Well, this one it is.I really like it. I am also a big fan of the Huntsman, which adds a saw, which makes it more of an outdoors survival tool than this Climber II. The more minimalist models in the lineup, Spartan and Tinker, do not have scissors, and in my opinion the scissors are among the more useful tools on a SAK. All in all, the Climber is a nice urban SAK in my book, and a good way to introduce friends to Victorinox without going overboard with the big and beefy models.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8FM5G02ROM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009KF4H0#wasThisHelpful","R3R8FM5G02ROM2","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a big fan of the work of Apple and Jobs, and I have read other books and articles over the years about them.  So I was very much looking forward to this book and pre-ordered and read it as soon as I could.Overall I am not disappointed.  That said, it was speculated in the press that the goal of this book was to shed Job's old image as a genius and sociopath, and the book does try hard to do this at the expense of being comprehensive about Jobs.Good:- Overall narrative focused on Jobs's personal growth over the years- Shorter and easier to read and follow than the Bible-length bio by Isaacson- Focused on relationships rather than products or events- Includes plenty of quotes and anecdotes not seen before, especially from people close to Jobs during his second tenure at Apple- Sheds light on his final years with cancer and the work on the iPhone and iPad (something Isaacson did not do as well)- Good insights on Jobs's thinking about products and business decisions- Shows Jobs's human side;  I loved the stories about him helping someone jump start his car or being late for the Stanford commencement addressBad:- Very incomplete and not comprehensive.  This should not be your first or only book about Apple or Jobs.  Isaacson, although too long, is better overall.- Completely omits quotes and anecdotes from bad relationships.  Why nothing from Job's girlfriend and mother of his estranged first daughter?  Why nothing from Lisa, his first daughter?  Why so little from Woz, the cofounder of Apple?  Why nothing from Jobs's biological or adoptive parents?- If family was really so important to Jobs (and I believe it), why not tell us more about them and how he chose to relate to them?  Jobs was apparently very private and protective about his family during his life - why not shed more light now that he is gone?  How did he choose to raise his children?  Why not mention more about Mona Simpson, his biological sister, or include her eulogy of Jobs after his death (can be found in NYT)?Overall this book glosses over the negative and tries to explain Steve Jobs's personality.  Since this ultimately tries to get to Jobs's motivation and values, I found I learned something new and it gave me food for thought about my own relationships at work and at home.Ultimately, this feels like the book that Laurene (Job's widow), Jony Ive (Apple design chief) and Tim Cook (Apple CEO) wanted written about their Steve.  And this is the book's main failing.  It is history rewritten by the winners, as it were.Recommended with reservations.  Read Isaacson first.UPDATE 4/5/2015:I have been rereading Isaacson's bio of Jobs in bits and pieces after I finished this book.  I find Isaacson's book much better, chock full of anecdotes, and also funnier.  And unlike this book, it also presents Jobs as very flawed which it appears he was.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YW4CFLYBJPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347405#wasThisHelpful","R39YW4CFLYBJPM","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this tester regularly. We have all sorts of batteries around the house, and occasionally wonder if they are good or not. This device answers that question. For devices that use multiple batteries (remotes, mice, lights), often one of the batteries dies first and the rest are in good shape, so having a battery tester can save you money by allowing you to replace only the bad batteries, not all.I use this with AA and AAA batteries most of the time, and rarely with 9V. I have no experience with the other battery types it supports.This is not a volt-meter per se, and it is also much cheaper than a real volt-meter. To me, it only answers the question, should I throw away this battery or not?

"I won a Nike+ Fuelband SE of these after winning a minor fitness challenge. Since it was free, I had to try it out. Prior to it, I had used a Fitbit One, Fitbit Flex, and Misfit Shine for a total of a couple of years, so I am familiar with fitness trackers and their features.Pros:- Looks good and feels comfortable- Screen is great, very readable white digits, and the rainbow-colored LEDs are refreshing every time- Very useful as a watch, best watch among the fitness trackers I have used- Water resistant - I wore it in the shower without a problem- Nike Fuel points are fun! I used to think steps are the way to go based on Fitbit, but I realize that there are different activity levels and points actually make a lot of sense- iOS app is gorgeous- Charges straight off a USB port, no cables or adaptors needed- Battery lasts about a weekCons:- Step tracking is not very precise - could be 20% off from Fitbit One which sits at the waist and is very accurate- Nike disbanded the Fuel team and announced they are getting out of the trackers market = no future?- No sleep tracking - the sleep sessions feature needs to be manually started and stopped and it is basically a stopwatch for time spent in bed, no analysis or tracking- Sessions feature was not useful to me, besides the amusement of being able to create and name my own sessions- Not really waterproof for swimming- Cannot track anything else besides walking and running (although I suspect it does OK at running-based sports like basketball, tennis, etc)- Plenty of negative reviews about poor reliabilityI sold mine after a week or two of use because I had two more trackers already. I enjoyed it, and I miss its watch feature and the gorgeous app.To me it is the most enjoyable fitness tracker I've had. Fitbit One is more accurate but very dull. Misfit Shine tracks sleep but it is a very crappy watch. Fitbit Flex is duller and less accurate compared to the other trackers mentioned in this review.Recommended, as long as you don't run into reliability issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10QPOQV8T4WFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0U9MQM#wasThisHelpful","R10QPOQV8T4WFU","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book as part of the Kindle First offers. The author takes some old tales about Nazi experiments with time travel and ships with mysteriously disappearing passengers and weaves a horror fantasy tale out of it.The premise is a little unbelievable (aging mobster gathering top scientists?) and what happens on the ship is a bit like a cheap horror movie, but in a good way. I found it a page turner, and I was surprised time and again by the twists of the plot on the ship. The violence towards the end was a little over the top for my taste. That said, I can totally see it made into a movie one day - the pace if fast and the scenes are vivid.I liked the book. 3 stars because while I enjoyed it, it is not a big favorite or a book I would re-read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V146GAI1YN8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWM7HYI#wasThisHelpful","R2V146GAI1YN8K","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading and following Starting Strength, I was inspired to read the same author's Practical Programming.It was in some ways a disappointment, even if it is a very valuable book. Let me explain:First of all, there is a lot of discussion of muscle physiology at a very detailed scientific level, which I found uninteresting and not directly applicable to my training. There is a lot of discussion of various training approaches and what a good or bad coach would do, making it clear the book is aimed at people who devise the training programs rather than the athletes or weightlifters themselves.Some slight annoyances are (1) repeating all the time how important overall strength via squats, deadlifts and presses is and (2) bias against bodybuilders in favor of strength training for Olympic lifting or other strength based sports. While I care about strength, I also care about looks, which is where bodybuilding approaches come in. In Arnold Schwarzenegger's Encyclopedia, there is a photo of Franco Columbu deadlifting 700 lbs, so bodybuilders are strong too. I found it annoying when the author made fun of them, which was thankfully not too often. Although the author dislikes bodybuilding, he describes what creates the ""pump"" and muscle hypertrophy and validates what Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote in his Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding, so that all squares away. Follow Arnold if you want to look like him, or Rippetoe if you want to build strength alone.As others have said, Chapter 6 about the novice program is in itself very valuable and perhaps the best part of this book. It adds detail about exercises, rest, and diet (including a sample daily meal plan) which are not found in Starting Strength. Chapters 7 and 8 provide similar details for intermediate and advanced training.If you are a novice, Starting Strength is sufficient and this follow up book is not needed; too little of it would be applicable, esp. if you are still making steady strength gains. Also, while Starting Strength is chock-full of useful information that's worth re-reading, Practical Programming is relatively dry, boring, and directly useful insights for the athlete himself are relatively rare.If you are a more advanced lifter or if you are a coach or fitness instructor, this book is for you. The author is very knowledgeable and a little overly thorough :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDCA8BGQIYKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU8YETW#wasThisHelpful","R2SDCA8BGQIYKH","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My lady has been using epilators for the longest time, over ten years. Granted,She's been lucky enough not to brake them, so she only used three or four different ones so she can't compare to all of them out there. She NEEDS an epilator. She has a lot of hair, and it grows really fast. If she shaves at night, the next day by noon she would have horrible black spots of hair. Also, after a couple of weeks, her hair would be so ingrown she would need to exfoliate for hours before she can do something with it.  So, shaving is not an option for her.As epilators go, the Philips Hp6520/70 Satin Soft Cordless Epilator is fine, it works as advertised. It removes hair. So far, we heard one brand after the other claiming that they are more effective or less painful. My lady has yet to try one that is significantly more effective or less painful than the others.So why 2 stars? Because it doesn't work while plugged, it needs to be charged to work and the battery doesn't last long enough for me to wax one whole leg. So here she was waxing, when on the middle of it, the thing stopped! With no way for her to use it while it was being charged.She likes the cordless feature, but I much rather be able to remove all the hair than having a cordless epilator. Not to mention, that there are other epilators that have batteries last much longer and they DO work while plugged.Hugely disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWIFVS0S9JDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I471LR2#wasThisHelpful","RMWIFVS0S9JDG","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book because it was recommended by Ben Horowitz in The Hard Thing About Hard Things, another solid management book.This book (High Output Management) dates from 1983 and it shows in the tone and subject matter. The book predates widespread email and talks a lot about manufacturing. However, these are not shortcomings. In fact, it is great that the author is not distracted by things like agile, lean, kanban, etc modern marvels. He makes an analogy between a fast food restaurant and other processes, including knowledge work and HR, and the analogy holds up. Of course, he also gives examples from his work at Intel.Key highlights:- what are high leverage activities and how to focus on them- how many direct reports are optimal- different types of meetings and how to run them, including 1:1s- task relevant maturity (TRM) of employees and how to manage them accordingly- how to give performance feedback- compensation and promotions- why and how you should invest in training programs- how to try to keep an employee who is quittingEverything is meat and potatoes of people and process management, and to the point. As I was reading this book, much of it resonated with my own experience, and at other times I was amazed at insights that showed me how Andy Grove truly was a top manager, after starting as a researcher and engineer.I wish I had a mentor or manager as wise as Andy Grove.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNOICGDDXSVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679762884#wasThisHelpful","R2NNOICGDDXSVN","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are interested in flow, as defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, this book is absolutely worth the five bucks (Kindle edition).However, Csikszentmihalyi's groundbreaking book, Flow, is a better introduction to this topic, and a better one-stop shop on this topic. Dr. Cs was the scientist behind this concept, while Mr. Kotler is a journalist providing mostly human-interest stories about extreme athletes.The overall thesis of this book is that flow puts the brain in a state where pattern recognition and learning happen at much faster rate, giving rise to superhuman achievements over relatively short periods of time. So consistent flow is a shortcut to mastery, esp. compared to the popular 10,000 hours of conscious practice.Unfortunately, the author focuses entirely on extreme sports enthusiasts: big-wall rock climbers (free soloists), white-water kayakers, giant-wave surfers, BASE and bungee jumpers, freedivers, X-games-winning skaters, acrobatic skiers, etc. I say unfortunately because (a) I could not identify with people who dedicate their life to these pursuits and many of whom die as a result and (b) it is fairly obvious that these pursuits produce flow, while trying to achieve flow in a more productive daily-life activity is difficult and not addressed here.The author mentions a McKinsey study that executives who experienced flow were five times more productive. I would have loved to read more about that, rather than about how a ski bum tore his rectal muscles while trying to stop himself from terminal velocity by grabbing a rope with superhuman strength.Things I learned:- Montessori schools tend to engender flow in students, more so than other educational methods- Skill to difficulty ratio should be 96% to 104% for flow (assuming you can actually measure this)- Group flow, like in a jazz band, group of rock climbers, engrossing conversation, is a phenomenon separate from but similar to individual flowOverall: Recommended, only as a sequel to Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31B9OF7H207NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW54XVO#wasThisHelpful","R31B9OF7H207NF","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this book is hailed as some sort of product development bible, I had to read it. I was very disappointed. If the ideas of rapid prototyping and A/B testing are new to you, there is plenty of value in this book, however.The ""lean"" method is different enough from traditional product development that unless you have practiced it, it is good to learn as much as possible about it by reading or otherwise since the methodology is non-obvious.The GOOD:Lean is very applicable to modern web software startups. The author makes it clear why the following are good practices:- validate business assumptions with real customers and working product or prototype- build the minimal viable product (MVP) which allows you to learn if a feature (set) is valuable- operate in small batches, ideally continuous deployment mode, so that the smallest changes are tested and effort is not spent unnecessarily on large features which may not be useful- A/B test everything to find the most valuable variant of a given featureA valuable concept is the Concierge MVP, which is basically a human-powered, high-touch early prototype that can be used to validate the usefulness of a product before you plunk down the effort to write code, build infrastructure, etc to scale.Random tidbit from the Japanese lean manufacturing lore: if you ask ""why"" five times in succession when investigating a production issue, you will unearth the true root cause. Who knew.Case studies from real companies (at least contemporary as of publication time) provide good examples of lean techniques.The BAD:The book is bloated and poorly organized. It is clear that the author did not use lean techniques and A/B testing to come up with the content :) The ideas are repeated as nauseam. Since I was reading this as an e-book, I would groan whenever another chapter started, waiting impatiently for the book to finally end.The author seems to think that Lean is applicable to *all* industries and human endeavors, and so set out to write a very generic book. If he had instead focused on web startups, this would have been a much more focused and shorter book. However, lean is known and practiced relatively widely, so perhaps this core audience is already converted.It is hopefully obvious why NASA did not use Lean Startup techniques to land a man on the Moon, and why Apple did not use it to design the first iPhone.Perhaps the biggest failure of the book is that it exposes (repetitively) the philosophical principles behind Lean but does not provide actionable examples / cookbooks for you to implement it.The UGLY:This book ultimately looks like promotion material for the author's consulting services for big companies that want to be innovative.There are also some aggrandizing statements here and there, like the proposal at the end to create a ""Long Term Stock Exchange"" as an alternative trading venue for company stocks, where value would be based on ""innovation accounting"" and of course the incessant references to his own company IMVU.VERDICT:Not recommended. Read blogs instead, and visit a company which practices continuous deployment and A/B testing -- you will learn a lot more that way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZX6V9AEBJKW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4XGN6#wasThisHelpful","RZX6V9AEBJKW6","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book over the past couple of days and loved it. It is among the best business books I have ever read (I know, the bar is low in this genre).The first chapter / read-before-you-buy sample is not representative of how good the book is. It starts with some autobiographical details that I personally did not find interesting. The first 2-3 chapters or 1/4 of the book is like that. And then it gets really to the point and turns into a kick-ass management guide.People management is mostly what the author covers. How to hire experienced executives. How to demote, reorg, and do layoffs. How to create a culture which is not political. How to communicate to avoid being misinterpreted. Different types of execs and CEOs. How to scale a company. How to integrate new employees and evaluate performance.The only topic which steers a bit away from people & process management is how to decide whether to sell your company, and that's a great chapter too.If you are a tech founder & CEO, this book is for you. If you are an executive, you will also find plenty of value. It is rare to find such unvarnished truth and stories from the trenches. Each chapter usually starts with a non-sequitur quote from a rap artist. I like rap too BTW. The quotes give some personality and flavor to the author's voice.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M2SJXK7FBMGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062273205#wasThisHelpful","R3M2SJXK7FBMGY","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am sure it is very healthy. According to the ingredients, it packs a ton of different vitamins, and it probably helps avoiding a cold and getting over it faster. Still, I took it when my throat couldn't take the abuse of my coughing any longer and I can't say it helped with one or the other any more than any regular tea would have.The flavor is pleasant enough, though is not very strong so don't put too much water. I was expecting something a little more citrusy but it is actually very sweet. I actually think some citrus would have help cutting the dull sweetness, but that is personal taste, I guess.

Nice colors- It has two big magnets, one on the top of pad, which hold very well- It has three easily detachable sections on each page: ""To do"" ""To Remember"" "" To Buy"". Even if I won't use them for their specific functions it is nice to be able to detach a small part if I don't need the whole page.- Really good quality paper- It has a lot of pages- It has an elastic on the bottom, to keep the pages together, which I image would make the pad hold and continue to looking tidy for much longer.My only issue with the pad is that it doesn't come with any writing device nor a place to put one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YW3S7FYGIBL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW6RRW6#wasThisHelpful","R1YW3S7FYGIBL3","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My current quest (around Christmas 2013) to find a camera which takes DSLR-quality photos but is small and convenient to carry has ended with finding the Sony NEX 3N. This review is specifically about the black NEX 3N model (I know that Amazon sometimes lumps several models together).This camera is great for casual photographers who want great image quality combined with convenience.By comparison, I have three old Canons which have served me for many years and I still use occasionally: a small PowerShot, a G-series, and a DSLR. A lot of the time these days I take photos with my Moto X due to its convenience and great image quality. I recently purchased, used, and ultimately got rid of the Nikon 1 J3, Samsung NX 2000, and Samsung Galaxy Camera superzoom, and I have played with a few more mirrorless cameras plus Sony RX100 etc. The Sony NEX 3N is the best camera of the bunch for my needs. Here is why:PROS:- Large APS-C sensor, same size as my DSLR. Helps with low light performance and allows you to easily blur the background for portraits. The latter is very hard with smaller sensor cameras, even with the 1-inch Nikon 1 series.- Very small and lightweight body with the kit 16-50mm lens. The lens is a folding design so it is smaller then not in use. Overall the NEX 3N is of comparable size to the Nikon 1 J and S-series, but the kit lens on the Nikon J protrudes more and makes it bulkier. The Sony is also lighter than the Nikon 1 and much lighter than the Samsung NX series.- Great ergonomics and one-handed use. You can easily hold the camera with your right hand (there is a nice grip for your finger tips), turn on the camera with your thumb, and operate the power zoom near the shutter / on-switch. Neither the Nikon 1 nor the Samsung NX allow you to do this - they are two-handed cameras. The ergonomics of the Nikon 1 are particularly bad in comparison.- Flip LCD screen for selfies (snapshots of yourself). This is amazing! In the first hour of owning this camera, we took our best family portrait while having fun with this feature. Very kid friendly too.- In camera HDR works very well. The images that come out have a balanced look and do not look like posterized caricatures (or the typical ""HDR-y"" look online)- 4 frames per second is great for capturing motion, especially kids- Taking video is easy and zoom and focus works well. Supports 1080i60 and 1080p24 as well as some lesser modes.- In-camera charging using micro USB, which is what most phones and tablets these days use. I can thus charge the camera in my car, for example.- Decent battery life. I have yet to run low on a family daytrip. That said, energy usage is high like on a point-and-shoot due to the extensive use of the LCD. DSLRs last a lot longer. When I can, I recharge at the end of the day.- ""Superior Auto"" is a great mode which I use most of the time. Besides automatic scene detection, it also gives you quick control over background blur, filter effects, saturation, etc.- As of this writing, this was the most affordable APS-C sensor camera. I bought mine used, and it was a screaming deal for a DSLR-sensor camera. Even priced as new, I think it is a bang for the buck. The other Sony NEX cameras are much pricier BTW.CONS:- HD video is in AVCHD format, which is not super PC-friendly and looks like Flickr does not support it directly. I have a way to transcode it to MP4, but it would be nice if the camera supported more mainstream formats.- No 720 HD video modes. Those are usually good for smaller video files or smoother motion tracking, but not available here.- No touch screen. This is not a big minus since the menu system is OK. The main plus of touch screens is control over focus.- No wifi. Although from what I have seen, only Samsung does a really good job with wifi and connectivity to Dropbox etc.- Phase detection autofocus would be nice to have. I am happy with AF as it is, but the Nikon 1 (and of course my DSLR) are snappier to focus. With moving subjects, this makes a difference.OVERALL:I think Sony has done a great job with the NEX series. The NEX 3N is the lower end of that series and it is already an awesome camera. The NEX 6 and 7 are even better, but also larger, heavier, and more suited for people who take their photography way more seriously than I do :) The battle in the mirrorless camera arena is between Sony NEX and Samsung NX at this point. Sony makes the better cameras overall and has more lenses, and Samsung has more in-camera features like touch screens, wifi sharing, etc. Both use APS-C sensors. Smaller sensors don't make much sense to me. I have not tried micro 4/3 due to the fact that they are not available in offline stores where I live; which indicates to me that those manufacturers are lagging behind in marketing. Nikon 1 looks like a toy compared to the NEX and the Nikon's sensor is too small for good portraits.Highly recommended.Regardless if you are coming down from an SLR or up from a point-and-shoot, you will like this take-anywhere camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G37TKJ3T0UKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BF9MUBM#wasThisHelpful","R3G37TKJ3T0UKQ","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the older version of these panels, as well as smaller and larger brethren from the same brand, for more than two years now. They work.This particular product allows you to plug in anything that charges from a USB port, or anything that charges from a car cigarette lighter plug. The latter is handy if you are stranded in the middle of nowhere with your car and you have car chargers for your phone, walkie talkie, etc.Caveat: with the older model that I have, I have found charging via the car plug adaptor to be finicky. It requires really good sunlight and even then it is easy to drop on/off charging mode. Maybe something to do with the voltage. I have not tried this with this newer model, they may have improved things.Overall, this is a lightweight, rugged solar panel which does a good job charging things in an emergency. I would not rely on this however as a regular charging solution. If you live off-grid, you are probably better off with larger panels and bigger batteries than what Goal 0 offers. This is however ideal for having in the car and using during camping trips.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3758P32T9CTDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2SPZAM#wasThisHelpful","R3758P32T9CTDR","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the older version of this device for about a couple of years, and now I got this latest version as well.Here is the intended use: open up the solar panels (two panels that together produce 7 watts in good sunlight), connect the AA battery charger gizmo, and charge the batteries. At a later point, use the AA batteries to power your flashlight, toy, or whatever it is, or use the charger itself (with the batteries in it) as a source of power via USB (connect it with a USB cable to your phone or tablet to charge). It works well in this role.More frequently, I use the Guide 10 battery charger indoors with USB only. I can charge batteries straight off my PC with a USB cable, without the solar panels. The charger also supports AAA batteries BTW. The charger also has a clear white LED so it can be used as a flashlight, which I have done occasionally when camping -- not as nice as a real flashlight, but plenty for lighting inside a tent or small room.The bad part: in the past I have had the battery charger melt on me (the area near the on/off/light switch). I do not even know why it happened since it took place inside my work bag when I was not looking. It appears that it may have been turned on somehow. Even so, it was a very disappointing experience which destroyed the charger and now I am more careful with these chargers. I have not had this happen again over the past couple of years.Pros:- easy to carry- handy solar and USB charging solution- supports rechargeable AA and AAA batteriesCons:- the batteries are not nearly the same quality as Sanyo Eneloop (do not last as long on a charge)- one charger melted on me in the past so keep an eye on them- more of a keep-alive than full-charge solution for smart phones (due to capacity of the batteries and speed of charging)Overall:Recommended, as long as you don't expect this to be a magical quick iPad charger :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJE15YTYTC5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DD6B9IK#wasThisHelpful","R2PJE15YTYTC5Z","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought this camera at half its retail price and I think in this case it is worth the money. After using this camera for a while, I am pretty sure that Android is the future of point-and-shoot cameras, if not all cameras. A big touch screen, wifi, and useful apps are much better than the clumsy old camera interfaces of the past.GOOD:- Superzoom lens. 21x zoom, starting at really wide angle. Not something a phone will be able to do any time soon.- Wifi connectivity + apps like Dropbox, Google Drive, Youtube, Flickr, etc means your photos can be backed up on the cloud immediately, or shared directly on Facebook, Twitter, and so on. I don't use a wire to download photos from this camera. By the time I get to my computer, the photos are already in the cloud.- Android and universal app support. Think of this as an Android phone which can't make calls. It can run all the apps you care about. Including Skype if you really want to make calls :) You can do all sorts of photo editing on the device using various apps. And you can check email, social networks, etc.- The whole interface is touchscreen driven and well designed. Usually a purely menu-driven UI sucks, but Samsung has pulled it off well here. I do wish there were a dedicated video button however.- You can pause and continue videos, creating a mini-movie with cuts between scenes. I had not seen this on other photo cameras before.- Relatively flat and compact. The huge 21x zoom lens folds neatly into the body and it is self-capping like any point-and-shoot. The camera fits in a back pocket or jacket pocket nicely.- Takes portrait oriented (vertical) videos, unlike other cameras. Video looks great, by the way.- Does not go overboard on high ISO in auto ISO mode (800 max) and it prefers to take lower exposures and still take the shot than go crazy on the ISO. Interesting idea, and I like it so far.- Standard micro USB charger like most Android devices. The battery charges inside the camera, like a phone.- Nice hand grip allows one-handed carry and use.- Decent built-in HDR (high dynamic range) and other useful modes.BAD:- Short battery life. This is probably the biggest shortcoming of this camera. I don't know if I can rely on it for a day trip or a weekend trip. I will try to put it to such a test before deciding whether to keep it. Android says 70% or more of the energy is used by the big touchscreen. Even dimming the screen and turning off GPS and Wifi have not helped much in my early testing.- Feels heavy. Definitely heavier than any other point-and-shoot I have played with lately. It is also a little thick for pants pockets. It fits, but not as easily as a phone.- HD video limited to 30fps.- Burst mode (multiple frames per second) does not seem to work well. It is slow, and after the first few frames, the rest come out dark, nearly black. As a result, this camera does not stop action well, esp. indoors.- I find myself using 1x - 2x zoom more than other settings. I wonder if this justifies keeping this camera compared to a zoom-less phone which would take nearly identical photos.- Small sensor has its limitations. It is hard to take really sharp, crisp, noise-free photos with this camera, especially indoors without flash. It takes nice photos on par with other point-and-shoots, but not on par with an SLR. You are paying here for a very flexible Android device rather than a fancy camera.- Auto white balance is a little off. It is a little warm indoors, and a little cool outdoors. Nikon 1 does a much better job. This Galaxy camera does a better job than the fancier Samsung NX series, however.VERDICT:- The jury is still out on this one. While it is probably the best point-and-shoot camera out there, I wonder if it is good enough to keep when compared with my phone.- If you want to own a futuristic camera, buy it. Every good camera in the future will have network connectivity, social networking, cloud storage, touch screen, and powerful in-camera photo editing. Like this Samsung Galaxy Camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QM6XLG6E1Q1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7EPVHY#wasThisHelpful","R2QM6XLG6E1Q1R","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is how I came to buy the Nikon 1 J3:During a recent trip, I discovered that my new Moto X phone took amazing photos and my old digital SLR was just too big & heavy for most occasions. So I started a mission to find something smaller and lighter which would partly or completely replace my SLR and take better photos than my phone. Note that most point-and-shoot cameras do not take better photos than the recent generation of phones, and in fact have the same sensors if not worse. Some sort of mirrorless large-sensor system seemed to be the answer, and I tried the Nikon 1 and others.In a nutshell, the Nikon 1 J3 is an outstanding camera with a terrible user interface.GOOD:- Takes good photos in all types of light. Press the shutter and it takes a photo right away, freezing the moment. No second guessing. Can't say that about most other cameras.- Super fast autofocus. It may well be quicker than most SLRs even. This camera is probably better suited for kids and sports photos than anything else you can buy.- Very high frame-per-second rate for full-sized photos. 15 fps with autofocus, 60 fps without! This is better than practically all other cameras on the market right now. I personally prefer the more sedate 5 fps which is still better than entry level SLRs :)- Good auto white balance. The photos come out looking natural, with good skin tones, etc.- Small and light. The kit lens has an interesting folding design to make itself more compact. This camera is smaller than all other interchangeable-lens mirrorless systems, as far as I can tell.- You can get some decent bokeh (blurry background for portraits etc) with the kit 10-30mm lens with big aperture plus remotebackground. Not as easy as APS-C or full frame sensors, but at least doable.- Clever ""unlock the lens and turn the camera on"" feature. No need to press the on/off button. Hard to describe but very handy. I wish other manufacturers did this too.- Even when noisy, the photos have an ""optically fuzzy,"" instead of ""digitally smeared"" look when viewed 1:1, which is a better and more pleasing noise reduction than many other manufacturers and cameras offer.- Instant access to HD video. Press the smaller button with a red dot on it from any camera mode.BAD:- Although it is small and light, and fits in a jacket pocket, this camera is bulky. The kit lens protrudes enough to make it look like you are carrying a good old rock in your pocket. I wish it were flatter. Still, much smaller than any SLR.- The mode selector wheel on top is useless. Normally you expect to find Auto mode + PASM. Here you get Auto + 4 weird and semi-useless modes which were probably conceived for the Japanese market. PASM is hidden under the menus of one of them. The other ones are ""automatic selection of the best photo"", ""take a slow motion 1 second clip before snapping a photo"" (WTF?) and advanced movie mode (which is useless since you can record HD from any mode with a dedicated button).- The camera is too menu driven for what it is. See above - PASM and scene modes are buried under menus. I like changing between P, A, and S. (On this camera, S is the most useful mode in my opinion.) HDR is hard enough to get to that I never really use it.- You can't hold this thing one-handed. It is very smooth and there is no finger hold on the right. Why? Even basic point-and-shoots have some little ridge, and SLRs have a big bulge for your right hand to grab.- Auto ISO tends to pick the highest allowed ISO (in my case, 3200) too often when indoors. I wish it would instead try to take a lower-exposure photo instead and let you handle it in post-processing.- No automatic orientation for photos and videos. Are you kidding? I had to flip all my vertical (portrait) orientation photos by hand  in Picasa or Lightroom. Good luck flipping a video file. Any smart phone can do better. My 5+ year-old cameras can do better than this.- Lens cap. Annoying. I like using hoods on my SLR lenses so the lens is protected when open but this is not an option here. Given the puny zoom range, I wish this were a fixed lens self-capping design (like any point-and-shoot).- Noisy raw photos. I tried taking a few indoor shots in NEF, Nikon's raw format. The luminance and chroma noise were shocking. I will stick to JPEG since the image processor does a good job taming the noise in a visually pleasing way. I do not want to waste my time in Lightroom or some other software on this issue.- High frames per second are a bit of a waste of time and storage space. 15fps produces a flood of nearly identical photos that take a while to wade through, and can clog up your storage card. I find it impossible to take a single photo in 15fps mode, while it is doable in 5fps. In 15fps mode, the camera occasionally loses focus (it autofocuses in between frames) and then finds it again. I am sure 15fps and 60fps have their use, but they don't appeal to me yet.- Short battery life. 300 photos maybe? You may last a daytrip if you don't do bit multi-frame-per-second bursts or video.- Image quality is visibly below SLR level. My 5+ year-old APS-C sensor DSLR with the 50mm 1.4 Canon lens (and half the megapixels) utterly destroys this Nikon 1. Better sharpness, color, noise, bokeh, level of control over the camera, etc. That said, that lens alone costs more than what I paid for this Nikon package on sale. Still, it is good to keep things in perspective. The Samsung NX series has equal or worse image quality compared to Nikon 1 (with kit lenses), so it is not just the sensor at play here but every element in the imaging chain.VERDICT:- Great for kids, sports, and low light situations. Better than an ordinary point-and-shoot camera in terms of speed and image quality. The responsiveness, fast focus and frames per second are on par if not better than an SLR at a fraction of the weight and size.- If the camera were more compact, like the Sony RX100 (which has the same sized sensor and is very fast too), I would be in love with it. As it is, it is too bulky to be pocketable and my daily companion, and I am still not sure if I want to keep it.UPDATE JANUARY 2014:- I returned this camera to the store. Instead, I got a Sony NEX 3N and I love it. It is lighter and yet is has a larger sensor, flip screen, wider angle kit lens, and vastly better ergonomics (plus it costs less). Feel free to check that camera out. It also does 4 frames per second, which is not as fast as the Nikon but enough to capture sports or kids in motion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMI0AANJDXT0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AY6MAY4#wasThisHelpful","RMI0AANJDXT0I","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been evaluating this camera for more than a week and comparing it against a Nikon 1 J3 plus my other older cameras. I have been a Canon guy over the years, and I currently have a P&S, a G series, and a DSLR from Canon, all of which are getting old so I was looking to get a large-sensor mirrorless camera.In many ways this camera points towards the future of non-phone cameras: it has a large sensor (bigger than a phone is ever likely to have), wifi connectivity for immediate upload and sharing, and large touch screen with smartphone like gestures (zoom, swipe, etc).GOOD:The best thing about this camera is the UI. With a couple of screen touches, you can change just about any setting. There is an awesome touch-focus-snap feature that allows you to focus where your finger is on the live image, and immediately take a shot. After using the touchscreen, any other camera without it looks primitive. The touch screen is great for taking photos as well as reviewing the results later.Wifi connectivity is also nice. It allows you to upload to Facebook, Picasa, Youtube, and Microsoft SkyDrive. I used the latter since it is like Dropbox - a good place to back up files for post-processing later on my PC. Wifi worked well.Lastly, because the sensor is APS-C size (like on most DSLRs), you get a nice shallow depth of field (bokeh blurry background) which is hard-to-impossible to obtain with smaller sensors.BAD:Image quality is closer to point-and-shoot than SLR. This shocked to me, given the large sensor. I attribute it to the image processor rather than sensor or lens. The images have a slightly pastel-blur quality to them (when viewed zoomed in) that I have last seen on an old Sony point-and-shoot I had 5 years ago. Looks like an image processing and compression artifact to me. Also, the level of noise at high ISO looks identical to that of the Nikon 1, whose sensor is 3x smaller.Auto white balance is also a bit off, at least on mine. It tends to produce slighly cooler tones, especially compared to the Nikon 1. Under indoor lights, when manually set to tungsten, the color matches the Nikon's auto white balance, but it is clear which company makes cameras and which one makes cell phones.Auto focus is slow and sometimes impossible under low light. This is very frustrating when trying to photograph kids - the moment will be gone by the time you are ready. Interestingly, if you use the touch-focus feature on the screen, the camera is much more likely to focus correctly, when the shutter button focus fails to focus. I guess there is difference between the shutter button focus trying to evaluate a larger area, while the touch-focus tries to find contrast in a smaller area and succeeds. Even so, focus is not as fast as I'd like (and slower than an SLR or the Nikon 1). BTW, focus is also likely to be lost during shooting video, especially at low light and longer zoom (50mm on the kit lens) and then there is a second or so of trying to lock on again, which is a bit annoying.Image stabilization is lacking. Most cameras in this class have it either in the body (sensor) or lens. Not here. The kit 20-50mm lens is not stabilized. This makes a difference in low light situations and when shooting video.Lastly, the physical buttons and controls on the camera suck. It would have been nice to have a normal PASM selector on top like most DSLRs have. Instead, there is a semi-useless selector on top (I avoid using it since it is hard to guess what it will do in what mode).OVERALL:Not recommended. Image and video quality are more important than UI and Wifi. The Nikon 1 has shown me that phase detect autofocus and image stabilization are necessary in a camera of this type. Samsung NX300 has phase detection, and if its autofocus is faster and better, I may give it a try. Another option is the Sony NEX series, which also has image stabilization and supposedly better image quality from the same size sensor (I have not yet tried it).","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24P5S3I3IMNWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5N6792#wasThisHelpful","R24P5S3I3IMNWJ","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used a Fitbit Flex for over a month because I had lost my Fitbit One. In a nutshell, Fitbit One is a better device.Pros (for the Flex):- always on your wrist, much harder to lose or forget at home etc- very water resistant -- I showered with it daily, and some moisture would get into the band but not affect the device itself- good battery life, lasts a week- sleep tracking easier than on Fitbit One because the device is with you when you go to bed (less likely to forget it)Cons:- Accuracy of step tracking is my biggest problem by far. First of all, because this is a wrist device unlike (Fitbit One and others that measure torso movements), I doubt Flex is able to detect activity when I am pushing a shopping cart, baby stroller, or simply carrying something in my hands. I use the device on my dominant hand (because the other has a watch), and although the device has a ""non-dominant hand"" setting, I do not believe it to be accurate. I noticed that my dominant hand moves less than the other because it is more likely to hold and carry things, or just move less based on how I carry my messenger bag, etc. Perhaps one way they get over the wrist vs torso and non-dominant wrist problem is by using some sort of multiplier compared to movements of the non-dominant wrist. Which leads to overestimating step count. For example, yesterday I mostly sat like a potato on very long international flight and yet I almost met my daily goal! On other days, I would go on long walks pushing a baby stroller, and barely make any progress. So Flex seems to overcount activity when you sway your hand like when walking, and undercount it when you are active but not moving your hands much. Fitbit One does not have this problem.- the five dots display is not very precise - you don't know whether you are 1999 steps short of your goal or 1, for example, and that frustrates me at times- entering and exiting sleep mode is too hard: you have to keep tapping the device like crazy, and sometimes it is more stubborn than usual; plus, it is still easy to forget to set it for sleep mode if you are too sleepy, or exit sleep mode in the morning if you are sleepy or in a hurry, which leads to missing or inaccurate sleep measurements- does not track or show climbing steps, distance, calories, etc which the Fitbit One doesI am returning the Flex and getting another Fitbit One. I can't wait to be able to see the exact number of steps I have made, pace myself during the day, and feel better about the accuracy of the measurements.Overall: Not Recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEL3CUVCXUH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O#wasThisHelpful","R3DEL3CUVCXUH4","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't understand all the positive reviews. We have several of these wooden drag along animals (from different brands) and I must say this is probably my least favorite.Cons:1- The wheels and the fin are made of plastic. We got a wooden toy because we do not want our kid playing with plastic.2- The wheels do not work, the fish can't remain standing for more than 2 seconds when the toddler pulls it. So instead of having a cute little fish following him or her around, the toddler has this floppy thing that follows sideways. Fortunately, the toy is very light so it doesn't scratch hardwood floors.3- The plastic, not really functional: wheels get dented and scratched after the most minimal contact with a slightly rough floor (example if taken to the sidewalk).4- They toy is a little boring: most of the other toys like this we have make some sort of rattle noise or have something open and close when they are being dragged, this one doesn't.Pros:1 - My toddler seems to like it.2 - Since it is very light, the baby can carry it around.3 - The big eyes are a huge success.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGW3YEO1VPLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYP6I1G#wasThisHelpful","R2JGW3YEO1VPLG","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love green toys! We love that they are made in the US. We love that they are made out of recycled materials. Though we would like it even better if it weren't made out of plastic. Maybe out of the biodegradable cornstarch material? We also love the size of them, they are big, sturdy toys, not the regular flimsy made in China toys. There are no bells and whistles, no lights and sounds but just a great quality product that work simply, but nicely. We have several of them and I am sure they will be a favorite for years to come: Babies love them because they are light, colorful and easy to grab, older kids like them because they are big and play really nice, grown-ups like them because they are darn cool. It is nice to find a brand that does not sacrifice quality (specially of play) in order to call themselves ""green"" or ""made in the USA"".The spaceship is nice and big.

"I had heard and read about this book, so I finally made myself read it. Overall, it is a good resource, although a little too limited, especially given the sheer number of pages.What's good:- If you feel sudden fear in an unfamiliar situation, trust it. This is good advice and the author gives some examples where trusting or mistrusting this fear had good or bad consequences for the person involved. Human intuition has been honed over millennia and can pinpoint something weird much faster than conscious thought can. In fact, apparently if your dog barks at a person while you talk to him, the dog is reading your body cues (because your human intuition is richer) rather than judging the other person directly.- List of behaviors that strangers and con artists use to gain your trust, and how to reject them.- List of questions to ask at your child's school about their security measures, and what to ask potential babysitters.- How to deal with stalkers and abusive spouses (in a nutshell, remove yourself from the interaction ASAP).- How to fire problem employees.- Some insights into how various types of criminals think and how they are after all human and one can read their motivations.- Reinforces the importance of good parenting with some chilling examples of parental failure.- Spells out the difference between fear and anxiety and suggests ways to reduce anxiety.- Covers well the social engineering side of (unorganized) violent crime.What's bad:- Tons of self-promotion and name dropping. The author has a celebrity protection company and works with leading law enforcement agencies since his clients are high profile. He makes this clear on every page of the book.- Covers reasonably well only the cases where violence is most obvious and predictable, e.g. child abuse or spousal abuse.- Does not provide actionable advice on what to do when faced with danger, besides the obvious ""trust your fear"". Perhaps he means to say, get the hell out of there, but that is not spelled out.- Insists that violence is always predictable, and the opinion to the contrary (plus being extra aware or prepared) is wrong. Yes, in cases where once can observe the potentially violent person, such as inside families or at work, I would agree with the author. However, in the US there is a surprising number of public place shootings where most of the attendees would have no idea that violence would be coming until it is upon them.- Contradicts himself when describing a high profile manhunt for a serious criminal, which unexpectedly reveals the lairs of two other stalkers close to his customer's residence, even though de Becker and his firm are supposed to be routinely on top of these threats. So things are not as clear and predictable after all?Overall recommended. That said, there are other good books on this topic out there, and after reading this one, learn also about ways to protect yourself and loved ones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PV1KPTCDQSP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440226198#wasThisHelpful","R2PV1KPTCDQSP2","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Suarez's first two books, I was really looking forward to this one, and overall I was not disappointed. I liked his first novel, Daemon, and wasn't too impressed with the second, Freedom. This third book is his second best, in my opinion better than Freedom and better than most action thriller books I have recently read.Suarez's first two novels were a lot more expansive in scope and thought provoking, trying to imagine the future through the lens of multiple technological trends. Kill Decision is a lot more focused on the near future and on military action and technology. This is why it reminded me of Tom Clancy - there is plenty of political conspiracy and intrigue, combined with special ops units and gallons of military jargon and abbreviations. This novel is thought provoking too, asking just how pervasive surveillance and drone attacks could be, and answering the question by introducing technologies currently believed to be cutting edge. In that sense, the style is also similar to Michael Crichton. There is also a good discussion of role of traditional and social media.So why only 3 stars? The plot and the ending were weak. Without giving away too much of a spoiler, it remains unclear who is behind the drone attacks. It is far from clear that the team of good guys has accomplished anything at the end besides giving us a fun and educational ride around the world (for which they get three stars). Also, there is bizarre emphasis on small ""dumb"" drones with ant-like swarming behavior (almost exclusively in the second half of the book) instead of the bigger and smarter (or human controlled) drones which appear at the beginning. In fact, this also signifies a disconnect between the research of the Stanford AI scientists early on in the book and the ant professor who occupies most of the rest, to the point that I wonder what the Stanford guys had to do with the plot at all, besides perhaps to tick off one more technology mention off the list. Another reviewer mentioned that in this book, the repetitive and annoying killer motorcycles of the earlier novels have been replaced by equally persistent killer drones, and I tend to agree. I wonder if this book was somehow rushed to print to capitalize on drones being a big topic du jour - it is clear that the plot lines and characters could have been a bit more elaborate like in the earlier novels. As it is, this book is more reminiscent of Ian Fleming's fun but relatively shallow action novels (which is also a compliment).Speaking of high tech gadgets, there are plenty. All sorts of brands and models of gear. Which brings me to two tiny annoyances. What's up with the special ops guys using Maglites? Who uses Maglites anymore? I would have expected them to at least have nice Surefire LED lights. And occasionally the good guys brandish a "".45 tactical pistol"" or a ""killing knife"" - what is that? Everything else has a brand or model number or at least a description, except their most basic tool?All in all, a fun read. It may even make you want to go and build your own little drone :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGZSK7UXEGLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073XV2W2#wasThisHelpful","R1IGZSK7UXEGLI","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- short read (and inexpensive to buy)- well written and to the point- decent primer on the larger structural trends affecting unemployment, especially in the most recent recession/depression- optimistic view of how individuals will be empowered to become global entrepreneurs by rich technology like Amazon, Etsy, Google ads, and of course the artificial intelligence marvels of the future- smart quotations from Aristotle and Keynes :)Cons:- most of the points should be familiar and obvious if you read financial news and tech blogs, e.g. increasing income disparity, technology developing exponentially faster and obsoleting humans, globalization and digitalization creating winner-take-all market dynamics, etc.- no bold predictions of the future and recommendations on how to cope with the huge social dislocations (the authors admit that re-education of low-skilled obsoleted workers does not work, and government handouts don't do much for morale)- no mention how the ongoing centralization of income and power, combined with ever more powerful technology could result in oppressive dystopiaIf you have lived under a rock and did not know about Moore's law, Google's self-driving cars and natural language processing, or the jobless recession recovery and falling real median incomes in the US, this book is for you.

"This is one of the best books I have ever read, in terms of the effect it has had on my worldview. It is a pity that it took me decades to stumble upon it (its opinions are unpopular), so I heartily recommend that you read it, even if you only have a cursory interest in it :)The book completely lives up to its title. It traces the emergence of the industrial revolution, the ""free market,"" and the social transformations (seismic upheavals would be a more appropriate description) that resulted from it. The author prophetically argues that a truly free market is a highly artificial construct with no parallel in earlier history, and if left to its own devices, it would lead (and has led) to ecological, economic, and cultural catastrophe. According to the author, the market should be subordinated to the needs of society instead of the other way around, and planning and intervention should be applied with that goal in mind.This books is a welcome antidote to all the political and economic dogmatism which has resulted from Adam Smith, Hayek, Mises, and even Marx. It is a pity that some reviewers here have given the book low marks. The level of free-market laissez-faire zombified indoctrination in the US is way over the top and most people simply cannot accept the fact that the truly unregulated market is a destructive force (in economic parlance, it produces huge negative externalities). It is sort of like nuclear energy, although the author does not make this analogy.There are of course issues with this book. The main one being its inaccessibility. It was written in the 1940s, so the language is a bit archaic (sentences too long for the Twitter generation). The author also assumes some familiarity with Europe of his time, especially the 1920s and 1930s; it would have been better if he had spelled out in a bit more detail what took place historically and why. Lastly, he dwells a bit too much on the English industrial revolution, and glosses over the continental one (Germany, France, others). Since he makes it clear that on the continent events took a different course, it would have been helpful to understand what happened and how it fits in his narrative.All this said, this book is very difficult to summarize since it is chock-full of thought-provoking insights. And the ending is beautiful and optimistic, very much worth the perseverance to read the whole tome :)Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26T4YHP1ZWGA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H3W3VU#wasThisHelpful","R26T4YHP1ZWGA9","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Granted, this is not a world changing device, but for the price, the convenience factor is definitely there. I love feeling like my baby's pacifiers are clean and sterilized any time I want and that it only takes a few seconds without me having to boil water or do other crazy things. I also like that I can put nipples from bottles in there. It is small, so it doesn't occupy a lot of space and it is ridiculously easy to use. It can be used anywhere where there is a microwave, so it is very handy for travel as well. This thing can also be used as a carrying box for pacifiers when traveling.There isn't enough info about the pacifiers themselves, however. Even after I researched, went to their website and tried to find everywhere about the type of pacifiers come with the device, I could not find any info. (Granted the package has a little dot that says BPA free, but does that mean that is all BPA free? That does mean only the device is BPA free? I don't know and I would like a little more info about it.)On the other hand, the company is European and usually Europe has tighter regulations about those things than the US, so that is comforting.

"I have been cursed with Zimba's hair, my hair can be described as a Lion's mane. What do I mean by that? Thin, frizzy hair, not exactly curly, though not straight either and with a tendency to occupy three times its volume. It has the advantage of being super malleable, I can do whatever I want with it and the disadvantage of getting ruined by just whispering at it. That means, I have a love-hate relationship with hair straighteners since I was twelve. I love how my hair looks when I use them, shiny, tidy, easy to handle, but on the other hand, use it twice and my hair starts to show all the signs of destruction.This straightener has a few key features that help with that:- The Keratin Therapy Bath: Helps the hair look shiny and keeps it protected, though I think it gives the straightner an odd and a little nasty smell when heated.- The fact that one can control the temperature: Super easy to determine which temperature to use to straighten your hair, great for people like me that have hair that is thin and easy to straighten but also easy to damage. Granted, using it in the lowest setting can make the straightening process a little longer and a little less effective, but it is worth it for every day use if you don't want to ruin your hair.I must say I used it a  couple of times and so far, it doesn't look like it is damaging my hair too much, which is great.Another great feature, that it automatically shuts off after a while, just in case you forget and it also has a locking mechanism that makes burning yourself less likely.Overall I think it is a good product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E1IECEHVAD48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007E0FQ1W#wasThisHelpful","R3E1IECEHVAD48","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book based on the positive reviews here and my own curiosity about new angles on European history.The book's main purpose is to re-examine the forgotten theory put forth by the Belgian historian Henri Pirenne in the early 20th century that Islam killed Classical culture and caused the dark ages in Europe. Emmet Scott, the writer of this book, spends quite a lot of time and ink debunking the main critics of Pirenne while examining relatively recent archeological evidence.I definitely learned a lot from the book, especially about Islamic piracy, slave trade, disruptions in normal Mediterranean trade, the three-century archeological and cultural gap and the destruction of cultural artifacts in the Asian and Mediterranean centers of civilization.It is clear that the author definitely has an axe to grind with Islam and dislikes the cultural effects of Muslim conquest on the Euro-Mediterranean world. He makes persuasive arguments along these lines.However, the book is flawed in many ways:- It is not clear who the intended audience is. There is a lot of archeological discussion and minutia early on, but towards the end the author starts jumping to unsupported speculation. It is clearly not a scientific work, but neither is it good political commentary.- The book takes way too long to get to its core points about the cultural effects Islam. Of 16 chapters, the first 10 at least are a slow-motion slog though archeological sites, discussions of books and papers and so on, without actually clearly stating a thesis or conclusion. Only towards the end does the author start to show his true colors and make bolder points.- The author assumes some (unclear) amount of familiarity with Islam and the world of classical antiquity. It would have been better if he provided more of a background on Islam as a religion and its civilization. It would have been great to focus more on the interactions of the West with Islam, including crusades, Lepanto, the reconquista in Spain, etc. The author draws some parallels between the fervency of Spanish Catholicism and Islam, but this theme deserves deeper development. How about Byzantine iconoclasm and Islam's lack of religious images?- There are some mixed messages when it comes to Islam and higher learning. The author tries to deny the mainstream assumption that Islam kept, improved, and re-introduced classical knowledge to Europe. This is a Protestant cultural myth whose genesis is well exposed. However, the author does mention centers of learning and literature in the Islamic world (while making earlier points about Islam as the destroyer of classical culture). So which is it? He should have been more focused in his message.- At the end the author undermines some of his own assertions that Islam caused three centuries of dark ages. Apparently chronology around that time was not ironclad and it may well be that the whole period lasted a couple of decades (instead of centuries) according to some controversial theories. Hmm, so we still do not know that much about the dark ages, do we?- Scott at some point concedes that Pirenne did not have that much evidence to base his theory on back in the day, even if his theory seems sound in light of modern archeology. Well, in that case why spend most of this book on the narrow topic of discussing the academic merits of Pirenne and the disappearance of papyrus from Europe, when the larger topic of Islam and the dark ages is far more interesting?In sum, I wish the author had edited (rewritten) the book with more focus on the dark ages, nascent Islam, and the Mediterranean of that time. I am OK with his biases, and in fact I wish he had explored his thesis in full, without spending 2/3 of the book on obscure archeological discussions and critiques of narrowly focused papers. As it is, nearly 70% of this book is very dry and slow reading followed by some interesting but poorly developed themes at the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RER1XTHWMH7IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0578094185#wasThisHelpful","RER1XTHWMH7IH","AOMKUI325W2TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMKUI325W2TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The “Mecca of Historic Preservation,” General George Washington’s Headquarters is the 1750 house built by Colonel Jonathan Hasbrouck and used by Washington during the Revolutionary War. It was scheduled to be torn down in 1850 but a group of preservations petitioned to keep the building intact and won. In addition to being the location where General Washington first issued the Purple Heart Medal, it was here “that Washington refused to become King.” Henry Hudson on “his historic voyage up the river that bears his name, anchored in the Newburgh Bay” and one of his fellow travelers told him “this is a very pleasant place to build a town on.” A hundred years later 54 Palatine refugees settled the area. The hardworking citizens turned the village into a manufacturing Mecca and their descendents built a thriving and modern city that was the second city in America to have it’s streets lighted by Thomas Edison. The city was noted for its architectural wonders. In nine chapters of photographs the book shows the growth of Newburgh from 1860 until the end of the 1960’s. The book is fascinating, but a little depressing when the government policy of Urban Renewal (Chapter 8) destroyed much of the town’s architecture and industry. Newburgh, NY is still a wonderful city although various levels of government have done their best to destroy this architectural jewel on the banks of the Hudson River. If the city can avoid becoming the main trash dump for NYC and stop other communities from sending bus loads of poor, largely uneducated people with no place to live to Newburgh, the city may still survive its problems just like it did Urban Renewal. Not mentioned in the book are some of the positive things happening in the city of Newburgh and the Town of Newburg on its border. There are now two colleges making their home in Newburgh City, the Stewart Air Force Base is now expanding to become an International Airport as well, and there are plans for building a casino near the airport. Hopefully Newburgh, which includes one of the largest historical districts in America will be able to prosper and retain its fantastic architectural and historical legacy. Other nearby towns such as New Paltz, NY have only been able to keep a few of their historic structures in the form of a one-street Village within the larger town, but Newburgh still retains 445 acres of its Historical District. Newburgh may survive simply because it’s one of the least expensive places to live within easy railroad commuter range of NYC. This book provides a nice peek at the town and its unique history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19D4C933G7GU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073850338X#wasThisHelpful","R19D4C933G7GU1","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me forever to finally get to the end of this silly, shallow novel. I'd read a couple of chapters and then get side tracked by another book and then another and then another. Try as I might I just could not enjoy this novel. The writing was okay, better than the plot, but much too wordy. It reminded me of the many attempts I'd made to read Thomas Hardy's ""Return of the Native"" where the author spends 30 pages describing a walk down a country road. I'm amazed anyone ever reached the end of that walk and finished that so-called ""Great English Novel."" I'm obviously too shallow for it.Reading it also reminded me of my phone conversations with my sister where she will spend an hour or more telling me every word and feeling she got from a 10 minute conversation about nothing with one of her friends.One of the first chapters of this novel set in L.A. involved the main female character waking up in bed  with a nude man that she could not remember ever meeting. She immediate starts trying to figure out if she had sex with this stranger. But there is no sign of used condoms or her diaphragm. Does any women in the college-aged, Millennial generation depicted in this novel even know what a diaphragm is?Anyway, the two strangers spend considerable time trying to find the woman's panties so she can getto her summer internship with an outfit called ""Boomerang."" The panties are gone until the couple accidentally finds them in the toaster oven. Okay, so that's supposed to be amusing. Maybe yes, maybe its just stupid?Frankly, the plot felt contrived and included lots of material (like the diaphragm) that would not likely be a part of the time frame of the story and it's characters.As somebody who lived in L.A. for several years, almost none of the residents we encountered (even in Hollywood) were as sex-crazed as the characters in this book. But having watched Jay Leno's ""Jay Walkers"" in utter dismay for several years since we lived there, I supposed Californians may have since dumbed down to a level described in this novel.Boring, boring, boring was my over-all reaction to this novel, even though the writer does know how to write. Maybe she managed to get farther along the country road in ""Return of the Native?""","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMD5OGJ3158R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006233106X#wasThisHelpful","RMD5OGJ3158R9","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought and read this book because I'm very interested in the city of Newburgh, NY's history. I'm not really a railroad buff like some of my friends. The book was well written and satisfied my curiosity about the important part railroads played in the development of the historic city of Newburgh and the rest of the Hudson River Valley. The city is old enough that Gen. George Washington's headquarters was located there and is now a museum. The city was also the second city in America to have Thomas Edison provide the streets with electric lights. There is a lot railroad history attached to Newburgh and an equal amount, or even more, attached to the eastern side of the Hudson River across from Newburgh, but that's another subject (especially Croton-Harmon) for the Arcadia publishers.This book only devotes one chapter of pictures to the railroads running along the other side of the river. While this book provided me with what I wanted to learn, after a while I got tired of the ten chapters of photographs of classic trains, railroad bridges, ferry boats, active and abandoned railroad stations. However, I'm certain that when I loan my railroad buff friends this volume that they will find it infinitely more entertaining because with their educated eyes, they will see rare details and delights in the historic photographs that mean little to me. And if they also happen to know the geography around Newburgh well, then the train schedules and maps will also be of much more interest to them. This is a useful reference book for true lovers of railroad history. It was even educational for a non-railroad history buff like me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MAH7GUIG8E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1467120960#wasThisHelpful","R25MAH7GUIG8E1","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s amazing how riveting a non-fiction book about modern day politics and power can really be. This is a 281-page turner in the purest sense of the term. It’s impossible to put the book aside once began. Readers of Edward Klein’s previous books won’t find this reading addiction surprising, but others should be prepared for a long night of blurry-eyed reading. Each chapter leaves the reader hanging over a cliff and ready to jump to the next exciting adventure in the political thriller. The book is nonpartisan in that the author doesn’t seem to favor either the Clintons or the Obamas. He just lays out the facts as best as he can based on interviews with many people who were present at the events and planning sessions. While many critics have claimed the book is a pack of lies, for those readers who have carefully followed the careers of the Clintons and the Obamas its difficult not to believe the contents of the books even if individuals might interpret them differently. The most interesting speculations, based on fact and common sense, are the secrets that Hillary and Bill are with-holding by omission that might make Hillary’s White House Run a flop. For those readers who believe what either the Clintons or Obamas say in public, be prepared for a shock to your system. It's unbelievable who really runs the nation because its really not the President.  It's amazing that every speech, decision, budget, law, executive order has to fulfill a political function whether or not it is good for the country. The political intrigues and lies that permeate Washington, DC, are truly Shakespearean. This book could easily be about the Roman Empire and its rulers and their political power struggles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Q8TMDD1AJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621573133#wasThisHelpful","R12Q8TMDD1AJQ","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Basil & Spice"" was the name of a blog this same author ran for years. The blog's title caused most new viewers to think it was a food or cooking website. Not so. Ditto for this book of poetry that does indeed use food metaphors as well as actual foods to introduce the readers to the Christian Cultures that have existed in the Middle East for two thousand years.So skillfully done is the writing, that many of the meals that are an important part of every family and extended family celebrations that the reader can almost taste the distinct flavors. Some times the descriptions of the meal preparation seem like they could be used as actual receipts for making the yummy taste bud pleasers.Reading this book will probably make most readers long for the large extended families that exist in the Middle East. Many of the mothers included in this book had a dozen children. The culture is so different that it almost seems like is from an unreal world.This book will open the eyes of the Western readers through it's descriptions of important milestones in family life that hasn't changed much since Jesus walked the same areas described in this tome. The events are timeless. Birth, Baptism, learning, courting, weddings with the new bride moving out of her childhood home to the house of her Mother-in-law, Diaspora, endless war, loss, death, funerals, hope, all these events are conveyed in the poetry of this volume. As the author writes, ""Music, dance, and poetry are in a sense the soul of the people of the Middle East. Poetry is often read aloud and is cherished, as it speaks to the heart in its native tongue.""It's definitely worth the read. And the reader should take a look at the author's portrait on the book's last page. The image almost seems to levitate. That adds a certain amount of surrealism to the marvelous poems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKEAACKNTIFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990375102#wasThisHelpful","R2YKEAACKNTIFS","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one of those folks who are fascinated with reading and comparing listings and rankings of various people, companies, political trends. sports teams and sexual habits, I found this book interesting but my mind told me that it was probably not relevant to anything.First of all, probably some of the greatest leaders in history may be totally forgotten in the mists of time. As far as great inventors goes, who was it that first discovered how to make fire?Secondly, it makes perfect sense that recent events and personalities are well known enough to be listed on more than a couple of data banks and computers, but what about those famous or non-famous people from the past that no one even knows the names of?Naturally, in this world of 24/7 media, current events and personalities are going to garner the most Google and other types of hits from people searching for information. Movie and music celebrities may soon be the most researched folks in the history of the world. Based on search hits Barrack Obama will probably be the listed as the most important leader of the 21st Century even though he may well prove to be by far the worst U.S. President in American History.This reader reviewer will continue to enjoy reading the constant barrage of new lists--Top Film Stars, Richest People, Most Popular Dog Breed, etc., etc., but 99.9% of them are fad flashes.Fame, like beauty is fleeting.Statistics are the worst of the three main types of lies. Readers of this book should always bear that fact in mind.

"For all those readers of the first Rush Revere story of the Pilgrims, this second book in the series won’t disappoint. As a Boston resident this reader loved the book because so much of it is set in and around Boston as well as the 13 colonies and England. Lavishly illustrated with both new paintings of Rush Revere and his time traveling horse “Liberty,” and historical documents and paintings of historical scenes. Ben Franklin is one of the main characters in this 242-page volume. The entire book could have been about Franklin because the Patriot was one of the most brilliant Americans to trod the country. He was an important force in the founding of the nation. Among his many inventions in addition to ‘Lightning Rods,” Franklin invented bi-focal eye glassed and even flippers to use for faster swimming. His flippers were shaped more like an artist’s palette than a frog’s webfoot. In addition to being a great inventor Franklin was also a good citizen. He founded the first Volunteer Fire Department in America as well as becoming one of the first famous newspaper men and book authors. Like in the first volume of this series, history comes alive for readers and listeners to the children’s-young adult history primer. Young readers will once again be transfixed by the time-traveling students and their part-time history teacher. Adults will also like this volume because of the presentation and the history that they’ve never heard before. This is a page-turner keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UDS58XH328B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476755884#wasThisHelpful","R3UDS58XH328B","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This illustrated, 185-page book of practical geology is a page-turner by anyone's standards. No sooner had my copy arrived in the mail than I was curled up on the sofa eagerly turning the pages and studying the excellent photographs, charts and maps. When I took my teenage son to visit Italy the number one site we both wanted to see was Pompeii, even though it was on the opposite coast of most of Italy's most visited sites. Both Pompeii and the nearby city of Herculaneum were buried for centuries but Mount Vesuvius has and will erupt again. Both these ancient cities will once more be buried, but now more than three million people live in the nearby area and a sudden major eruption will seem like the end of the world for most of them. For those people who have visited Pompeii, another discovery that every tourist makes is that Mt. Vesuvius is only the volcano closest to Pompeii and Naples. As one stands on the upper seats of Pompeii's coliseum they will notice a long line of other volcanoes running along the coast. Some of them appear much larger than Vesuvius. This situation is also true for the Northwest United States. Mt. Rainer, Mt Hood and Mt. St. Helens are all part of the Pacific Rim of Volcanoes. It's interesting to read why people continue to live in the shadows of volcanoes even thought they know the danger. This book answers some of the questions about that living on the edge. Chapter 5 is called, ""'It's part of the culture. Live with it! --cities in Japan.'"" The book's other eight chapters also point to similar answers. This is a quick and brief book that wastes no time making its important points. It will answer many reader's questions about why people live on the edge of such proven dangerous neighbors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYZWARUB63R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107039231#wasThisHelpful","R1EYZWARUB63R5","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many years the National Geographic has maintained a special relationship with the White House and  every few years the NGS produces or updates a lavish full color update on the various U.S. Presidents life in the White House. This new edition of that continuing documentation is a 353 pages of large format, coffee table book.This book, with a foreword by Laura Bush continues to update the public on the building and traditions of ""The People's House."" Unlike some of the earlier small format paperback editions such as ""The Living White House"" this book is what most readers would expect a book about their leader's house to be like.National Geographic, unlike most publications, is located in Washington, D.C., not far from the White House and whenever some notable event takes place, NGS will send over a photographer or two to document it. Most photographic interns at the NGS spend some time providing photographic coverage of these White House events. When Lady Byrd Johnson was first lady, nearly every tree planting in her campaign to beautify Washington was covered by National Geographic photographers. This means that the National Geographic Society has an almost limitless collection of beautiful images with which to make it's selectionsfor these books.The NGS provides continuing coverage of the White House and other landmark buildings in or near Washington, D.C. This collection of White House history and photographs is exactly what most fans of the NGS would expect. It makes a nice coffee table illustrated history book.

"As a Midwesterner I had no idea of the history behind the legendary New York Chelsea Hotel. I had thought it was just another one of those famous 100 year-old New York Hotels. What a delightful surprise I found when I started to read this wonderful history of the historic Chelsea Hotel. In 1884 ""The Chelsea Association Building began its life as one of the city's first great apartment buildings--a cooperative club set in the middle of what was then the city's mass-transit crossroads and its center for the arts--and became residential hotel shortly after the turn of the century. Near the end of the Depression, when it succumbed to bankruptcy, the hotel was bought by a syndicate of arts-friendly Hungarian émigrés and managed by them for nearly seventy years. Over the decades, the genteel home for artists grew increasingly shabby as etched-glass panels were broken, murals painted over, and parquet floors pulled up so the buildings original eighty apartments could be partitioned into more than three hundred rooms and suites...In 1966, when the hotel was granted official city-landmark status--over strident objections by some neighboring business owners, who thought it would be better to raze the bohemian enclave some of the suites retained their late-Victorian grandeur.""What non-New Yorkers such as this reviewer didn't know was that the Hotel was a commune for artists much like many others such as Massachusetts' Brook Farm that failed after only five years. Hotel Chelsea's commune for artists managed to survive for more than 125 years because it included a much larger number of fabulously wealthy residents and patrons. It is now in the hands of a NYC developer who plans to convert it back to a boutique hotel. Since there are still 80 households holding down their units, the proposed boutique hotel may be a while coming.The list of famous residents who at one time resided at the hotel commune would require several pages just to list. A few of them included writers Mark Twain, Thomas Wolfe, Allen Ginsberg, Arthur Miller, and Arthur C. Clark. Artists included John Sloan, Jackson Pollock, Dennis Hopper, and Larry Rivers. Musicians included Virgil Thomas, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin and Pattie Smith.If the reader likes reading about some of the most famous artists and writers who ever lived, this book is filled with their adventures and creations at the Hotel Chelsea. Many of the hotels long-term residents came to spend a single night and never left. The ashes of several former residents were scattered around the rooftop garden. The readers will probably find it interesting to learn who they were?Other trivia answers readers can find out about are: Where was the Britney Spears Room? What famous writer did Jack Kerouac have a one-night stand with at the Chelsea? What play did Arthur Miller write while residing in the commune? Where did Andy Warhol shoot his film?  What album did Bob Dylan compose while living there?  When did film producer Stanley Kubrick visit Arthur Clark to work on ""2001: A Space Odyssey?"" Were Janice Joplin, Madonna and Marianne Faithful full-time residents there? How many famous authors wrote about the Chelsea Hotel based on their personal experiences living in the grand old place?The Chelsea Hotel was indeed a ""Dream Palace"" although many of it's neighors over the decades considered it more of a nightmare. The reason's for the latter opinions were probably the most interesting parts of this illustrated history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ASWOS6EQ52Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618726349#wasThisHelpful","R24ASWOS6EQ52Y","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may just be coincidence, but lately this reviewer has read a lot of books that started out as page-turners but by the end had run out of energy. This was another one. Young “Winston was determined from an early age to make a name for himself and pursue a career in politics. “ He chose a military career in the 4th (Queens Own) Hussars, one of England’s elite cavalry regiments, “Churchill believed that a distinguished military career was, for someone of his background and class, the perfect preparation for entering politics Winning medals and decorations fighting for his country would enable him to ‘beat my sword into an iron Dispatch box’ For Churchill, this was the perfect ‘foundation for political life’, after which he intended to ‘devote my life to the preservation of this great Empire and to trying to maintain the progress of the English people.’” During Churchill’s six week participation in the Malakand campaign he also because a journalist by writing a series of articles for the Daily Telegraph. That series resulted in him receiving a deal to publish his first book in 1898 under the title “The Story of the Malakand Field Force: An Episode of Frontier War.” That book began Churchill’s life-long writing career. Young Winston later took part in the Boer War, ‘”where his dramatic escape from captivity made him a household name, helping him to win his first seat as an MP for Oldham in 1900.” Churchill had a plan and he turned it into reality. Along the way he was almost killed in several hard-fought battles. “The loss of so many of his fellow officers and comrades caused Churchill to reflect on the risks inherent to a military career. In other callings, such as politics, business or the arts, a person who conducted themselves properly and worked hard could look forward to advancement, while successful pursuit of a military career depended to a large extent on luck. It did not matter how many times a soldier had been under fire, each time he took to the field his chances of being killed were the same. He was saddened by the death of Colonel O’Bryen, a career officer with a record of distinguished service who had been destined for further promotion. But his career was cut short when he met, as Churchill remarked, ‘as fine an end as a soldier can desire’ fighting the Mohmands.” When the author sticks to the exploits of young Churchill the book moves right along. Unfortunately, depending of course on your viewpoint, the end of the book compares Churchill’s experience fighting in the Afghan campaign in the 1890’s with today’s American Military Campaign in Afghanistan. Most of the fighting took place in the same locations and involves descendents of the same fierce tribesmen Churchill fought as a young man in his first military adventure. That’s not the reason most people will read this book about what made Winston Churchill the great leader he was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY9BQL9R40ZSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043042#wasThisHelpful","RY9BQL9R40ZSZ","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 388-page history of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his classic novel is well written, full of interesting historical trivia and exhaustive. At first it was a page-turner but eventually it reached a point that for this reader there was more information than I really wished to know about the two subjects.""'Careless People' is an histoire trouve about what was in the air as Fitzgerald wrote 'The Great Gatsby,' including the unfolding of a remarkable le tale of murder, adultery, class resentment, mistaken identity, and the invention of romantic pasts. In telling the story of the autumn of 1922, 'Careless People' also tells the story of an extended party, what Fitzgerald called their `Bacchic diversions, mild or fantastic.'""  ""Jazz age parties reached their literary apotheosis with the publication of ""The Great Gatsby,"" which predicted the party would come crashing to an end."" The book, like ""The Great Gatsby"" is laid out in nine chapters so it is easier for the reader to associate the history and criticism with the novel. The writing and research that went into this book is impressive but for some reason the magic didn't last. It was like going into a world-class museum and after a short time the visitor is so saturated with great art that he is no longer able to fully appreciate the continuing experience.  It was interesting to learn that the book was not particularly well received at the time it was published. This is a terrific book for the hard-core F.

"The first chapter of this excellent book that I read was  ""Leonard Nimoy: The Interview."" I didn't know that the legendary ""Mr. Spock"" had been an amateur photographer since he was a teenager  living in the West End of Boston. Like many beginning photographers he turned his family's bathroom into his part-time darkroom. Mr. NImoy takes a very intellectual approach to his fine art photography and the themes of his work. Readers of this volume will probably reach the same conclusion I did. This chapter alone is worth the modest cost of the book. But the book contains so, so much more valuable information. ""A couple explained that they had never considered themselves collectors until they had run out of wall spaces and continued buying photographs."" How many of us have made that discovery in the same manner? Anyone who has discovered he or she is a born collector will find valuable advice in this gold mine of practical information. ""For those of you who are that hungry to be fine art photographers, you should know that as a gallery owner: ""I'm looking for the ones who are in it to win it. ""I want to surround myself with like-minded people. "" I expect to see you at the portfolio review events. "" I expect to see your marketing materials in my mailbox."" The author of this entertaining and informative book has been a photographer, worked in the corporate world for years and owned a gallery for many years as well. This book is a curious, but fascinating mixture of common sense essays and interviews based on experience. ""How will you connect yourself to the right people in the world--the ones that will help you in your career?"" ""Photography + Business + Peers + Mentors + Networking--it all plays a part in how and why I wanted to open and operate a fine art photography gallery and write this book. I want to be able to help artists and photographers gain the exposure that they deserve. It's a great feeling to live vicariously through their successes. I guess you can think of me as a glorified P.R. Agent."" This book is a collection of examples of how some fine arts photographers made it and how many other talented wannabe fine arts photographers need to start building a network that will allow them to succeed with their desires, at least if they want to ever sell any of their work and receive some much deserved recognition. As a professional photojournalist for a brief time, an avid amateur photographer for almost 50 years who has also worked as a documentary film maker and even a movie critic, I found myself definitely lacking in the skills taught in this guide book. It's too bad Jason didn't publish this book decades ago when this reviewer was much younger. Like most artists, I preferred to concentrate all my efforts on making photographs, creating photographic books and films. I was pretty good at all those things and lousy at promoting and marketing.Like most readers of this book, I quickly learned how pitiful my efforts at networking have really been. There is much to be learned from this tome. In almost 50 short chapters Jason Landry shares some of his insights into the world of fine art photography and life in general. This reviewer lives in the same Back Bay Boston neighborhood and when Landry chooses to share some of the observations he has noted about his neighborhood, they are right on the mark and the truth of them becomes so obvious. If those observations are so accurate, it's a good bet that his other observations about collecting and selling fine arts photographs are also dead on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZ2YG7OFUNV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990013502#wasThisHelpful","R1SZ2YG7OFUNV6","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading a terrific, illustrated two-page review of this book in the May 12, 2013 Sunday NYPOST I ordered a copy for myself. I started reading it the day it arrived. After finishing the first chapter I thought maybe I'd received the wrong book. I double-checked the review and confirmed that I indeed had received the same book I'd ordered.I read a little more and put the tome aside for a month to see if maybe I was just in a bad mood for reading this particular title. When I returned to it I read a couple of chapters in the middle of the book to see if it got more interesting. Frustrated, I put it aside for another month or so and once again returned to reading it.Nothing had changed and I began speed reading the rest of it before the book dissolved in my hands as it suffered from a strange case of boredom fever.Normally, I wouldn't even bother reviewing a book I disliked this much, but in this case I want to warn other readers that this may be the most boring book ever published on such a universally interesting topic. Maybe it was the illustrations in the NYPOST review that misled this reader?","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GINMPAO18Q1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061906085#wasThisHelpful","R1GINMPAO18Q1K","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This terrific telling of the true history of the Pilgrims is excellent, but for some reason it was a bit disappointing. As I was reading I had to constantly try and put myself in the mindset of a 10-year old child or young adult because there were things I was reading that struck me as holes in the story approach.The first problem was that the book reminded me too much of an advertisement for Rush Limbaugh's Tea Company. He really didn't over-do the commercialization, but it still hung over the entire narrative. However the Tea Company character of Rush Revere was probably the idea that started the whole book project as a narrative vehicle.Another of the little problems that may have only bothered me was that there was actual interaction between Rush Revere and his two student time travelers and the Pilgrims. Rather than actually communicating with them it seemed like the time travelers could have simply observed all the action from inside an invisible bubble where they could see and hear everything, but none of the Pilgrims would be aware of their presence. For instance, how does a flying horse with three riders land and take off from the May Flower several times without being observed by somebody on the small sailing ship? Also, after making friends with several of the Pilgrim leaders and ship's captain, how is it that those folks don't notice their absence during most of the trip and wonder if they fell overboard and go looking for them just to be sure? After three months on the storm-tossed May Flower, most of the crew and passengers must have smelled like a sewer, but Rush Revere and his companions arrive smelling fresh and wearing clean clothes? Rush Revere talks about not doing anything to change the future while visiting the Pilgrims but many of his young readers will realize just interacting with the Pilgrims in anyway would probably effect the future. Since this book will probably be followed by other time-travel visits to America's past, Rush might do well to consider the above-mentioned problems.The book does a wonderful job of telling the historical truth about the Pilgrims and their experiences and is based on diaries and journals of various Pilgrims. It has first-hand documentation of the events that differ greatly from what is taught in the schoolroom. But if these puzzling time travel paradoxes that seemed so obvious to this reader also distract the intended readers, then many of the important lessons of the narrative may be lost to them. Adults will also enjoy this book because what really occurred with the Pilgrims will be totally new and different from what 99% of Americans have been taught. Despite the minor problems mentioned this is a very important book. His correction of the current revised history taught in schools will probably be the first time the general public has learned these facts. Everyone who reads the book will have a much better idea of why the Pilgrims sailed to the Americas, the hardships they endured on the voyage and after their arrival in Massachusetts. The will learn about  the various political and economic systems that were developed and tested in order to assure the colonies survival in a harsh, unforgiving new world. The readers will know how the Pilgrims dressed, what weapons they used, how they trusted God for their very lives and their relations with the Native Americans. Although this reader read the hardback edition of the book, it's easy to see how the audio edition might be more interesting to younger readers. A good narrator like Rush Limbaugh could easily make the text come alive with different voices and pacing and maybe even use some minor sound effects to help make the story real. I don't know if the audio edition contains sound effects since I've not listened to it. This is an important step in telling the truth about American History and Capitalism. Reading the book reminded me of the old Walter Cronkite ""You Are There"" CBS television series that brought the audience to re-enactments of historical events. This book makes the reader feel that they too are there watching history in the making.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VV2ONSH372Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476755868#wasThisHelpful","R18VV2ONSH372Y","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a general rule I don't read the novel a movie is based on if I've seen the motion picture first.  In this case I made an exception because I was in need of something to read while riding an exercise bicycle to nowhere at the gym. The experience reminded me of why I don't see the movie before reading the book. It's almost impossible to get the image of the actor playing the individual parts out of the mind so that the reader can develop his own imagined image of the character. Since there are 500 reader reviews ahead of this one, about all I'll add to that vast selection is that the book is excellent. For readers like me who live in Boston and Cambridge it was an accurate description of the locale. For readers who have spent much time at gambling casinos and boats, it also had a feeling of realism. It's fun reading about the system of counting cards described in the book. It's fun seeing how the casinos treat the VIP Whales since most of us will never experience those wicked pleasures on such a grand scale. But no matter how many books are written about the casino gambling business and the people who inhabit it, it still puzzles me how folks can walk into one of those multistory, gleaming Oz-like Towers and think that they can actually beat the house. Common sense and plain eyesight says the house wins because that's what pays for building the house in the first place. The charm of this story is seeing how a bunch of geeky MIT students are able to beat the house at it's own game for at least a little while. This is an excellent escape to that Oz-like world of Casinos and the little guy against the system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XVCD9NEHUOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743249992#wasThisHelpful","R39XVCD9NEHUOH","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second fine arts photograph by this photographer that I've purchased through Amazon's new Collectables and Fine Art Division. I bought this one because I was so enjoying the earlier one since I had it framed and hung on my office wall. While I'm not certain, I believe the models in both of my purchases are the same woman. There is a poised magic about her and the way the photographer has posed her within the individual environment of the overall scene. The photographer seems to be using the light and backgrounds for this and the earlier image in the manner of Paul Strand and/or Edward Weston. There is still some magic that comes from beautiful black and white photographs that is missing from most color work. My compliments to the skilled photographer and his selection of the right model for his pictures. Both the final product and model are superb.Readers of this review might also enjoy my earlier Amazon review of ""Nude Standing In Rock Formation"" by the same photographer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNUX5GFOQE6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPY0Q0C#wasThisHelpful","R1XNUX5GFOQE6O","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was totally unfamiliar with the work of this artist who seems to divide his time between woodcuts, graphics and photography. This particular mountain photo seemed to reach out and grab my full attention. It also seemed to tower over most of the other work by the same artist offered on the site, but that is probably just a matter of personal taste? I'm putting this beautiful scene between two of my classic mountain photos by Brad Washburn.One thing that has caused me to wonder about this work is how is the artist making any money from these limited editions. It would seem that by the time Amazon's sales commission and the commission charged bythe gallery Zatista Fine & Contemporary are deducted from the sales price the photographer/artist will be making a pittance. This photograph has an edition of 96, so I supposed that they may change the size of the print and make another edition. It's puzzling. Maybe Amazon doesn't take 55% of the commission on it's art like it does on its book sales?Whatever the business details, this is a beautiful image at a very modest sales price. It may be one of those cases where it costs more to custom frame it than it does for the art itself?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YLPRGZGVREXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPXAHU2#wasThisHelpful","R2YLPRGZGVREXB","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book that I've had around the house for years and every time I come across it I can't resist delving into the mysteries it explains. The paperback copy I have was published in 1987. The fact it is still being published says much about its content. It's simply a fun, fun read. Learning the history behind common, everyday beliefs, activities and language is both entertaining and satisfying. It' also nice to be able to jump into the text anywhere. There is no need to start at the volume's beginning. The segments are relatively short and many are illustrated. It reminds this reader of Joe Friday's old saying, ""Just the facts, nothing but the facts.""

"For all those political junkies who follow Michael Barone's election analysis this book answers the question of how does he know so much about every voting district in the United States. He has been compiling 22 editions of ""The Almanac of American Politics"" since 1971. During that period he has answered the questions of why certain voting patterns occur in particular locales. Surprisingly, much of it has to do with the way various sections of the United States were originally settled by immigrants. In a fascinating Preface and six chapters Mr. Barone shares some of his observations about how immigration has shaped the nation. The six chapters are titled: ""The Fighting Scots-Irish, Yankees and Grandees, The Irish and Germans, Incomplete Conquest, Promised Lands"" and ""Migrations of Choice"" plus detailed notes, acknowledgements and an excellent index. What may surprise the readers is that the way early pioneers settled across the country was mostly governed by government politics and taxes. Even in the earliest days of the creation of what is now the USA, government regulations created by the earlier colonies caused certain immigrant groups to move in distinct directions in order to avoid the taxes and rules of those original thirteen colonies. The author is at this best in this book when he uses his detailed information on each and every geographical area to make his overall observations about how early immigration still influences the various geographic areas of America today. Not surprisingly, the reasons for immigration today is much the same as it was historically. In addition to the major immigrations by foreigners, the author makes some wonderful points of current immigrations patterns that most people don't think of as immigrations. Fleeing the poverty, crime and taxes of the cities beginning in the 1950s is one example. An earlier example was when the industrial revolution caused people to move from rural areas into the cities. Even air conditioning caused major population moves from the north to the south. While it's sometimes easy to get bogged down in the details and charts illustrating these immigrations patterns, the book is still well worth taking a look at. It's amazing that one of the chief motivations for moving to a different section of the USA is economic. People still follow the jobs. Both the employers and workers seek out the lowest cost of living and individual taxes that they can find. This is a very revealing book about the habits of the voters and why it has occurred like it has.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1452NOH8BG3ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307461513#wasThisHelpful","R1452NOH8BG3ST","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It only takes an hour to read all the text in this volume and to read the poetry that helps explain how Frida may have felt when she painted the works included in the volume. None of the artwork is unknown to anyone who is familiar with the work of Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon who chose to call herself ""Frida, German for `peace.'"" Sometimes she hated it when the last name of her two-time (pun intended) husband Diego Rivera was added to make her Frida Rivera. Why she disliked that is explained in one of the author's poems. One of the statements included from Frida's letters and diary gives her opinion of the United States. ""The most important thing for everyone in Gringolandia is to have ambition and becomes `somebody,' and frankly, I don't have the least ambition to become anybody."" This is a very readable introduction to Frida and her work for students and young adults. The poems hit some of the main themes of her life without going into detail. For instance, she carried on ""a brief affair with the exiled Soviet revolutionary, Leon Trotsky, whom Diego had brought to Mexico."" Frida was lucky that she too didn't die from a hatchet to the brain, as did Trotsky when he was tracked down and assassinated. It's definitely  a worthwhile addition to any school reading list.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2KAULB6W9F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761453369#wasThisHelpful","RD2KAULB6W9F6","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost didn't read this biography/memoir of ""Silver City Millie"" because the historic photos illustrating it were so blah. Finally, just before donating it to the Boston Public Library I read a few pages and was enthralled enough to save it long enough for me to read.  It was really well written. The pictures illustrating it were mostly taken decades after the reason for capturing them on film had passed. The photographs proved something else as well. The actual historical characters seldom look like the stereotypical Hollywood image of them. This is definitely true about this character because if you saw her in real life she was not very pretty, even considering the always changing standards of beauty. She had a grandmother's face even at age three according to the picture of her included in the book. However, she must have had a personality that really wowed every man she met. ""Her mirth was an infectious as a happy plague."" She was interesting enough as a businesswoman that she had many lifelong male friends who visited her simply to talk and socialize and plan political and business deals. Everyone fell under her spell.""Millie's laugh was a softly rolling symphony, almost demanding in its resonant beauty to be mirthfully joined. People simply enjoyed looking into her enigmatic eyes and hearing the laughter that gave such a pleasing promise of joy."" ""It was difficult for many of the citizens of New Mexico and beyond to believe that Millie had scores of men who were just plain good friends. There were those who came to Millie's house just to visit and share confidences without any idea of going to bed with her or any of the other girls. Millie was puzzled all her life at society's failure to understand that the opposite sexes can have attractions for one another that have nothing to do with sexuality. She feels strongly that this is one of the major, but unacknowledged causes of worldwide conflict, not to mention the petty personal problems of everyday existence."" Orphaned at a young age by the swine flu she and her three years older sister Florence were adopted.  But the stepparent's older son had stolen 13-year-old Millie's skates and she eventually got even and ""whupped him, your honor, for stealin' my skate"" As she told the juvenile judge in Kansas City. The judge was named Harry S. Truman and yes, it was the same one who would become President. ""Judge Harry Truman"" turned Millie over to the custody of the Papadakis, thereby helping add someone else to the list of people would become legends in their own time."" Millie when she was just under 12 years old, she and a school chum started running errands on her way home from school  for the large number of women leaning out the windows and doors of the Twelfth Street Red Light District of Kansas City. Soon, the kids ""were running errands of one sort or another, for practically every whore in the Kansas City red-light district."" That was her first experience with ladies of the night. It certainly wouldn't be the last. ""Eventually, she owned seven bordellos in three states and thirty-six big Chryslers (Most of those new Chryslers were gifts from her men friends) In 1945 she bought a bordello in Laramie, Wyoming."" Millie lived to age 87 and died just before Christmas of 1993. Most of her whorehouses had been closed by 1968. During her long life of  excessive drinking and endless sex she met and befriended many of the most powerful men in the Southwest Dessert section of the United States. She was friends with cattle barons, oil, silver and copper barons, railroad owners and railroad workers, college students, movie stars and politicians from police officials to governors and first ladies of the US and thousands of other less famous admirers. She was very well connected. She was an important and much sought after character in the history of her time. She was a hard worker and excellent businesswoman. She owned cafes, beauty salons, bars, gambling joints, parking lots that she rented by the hour to taxi companies. She owned rental properties and jukeboxes where she raised the price of a song from a nickel to fifty cents. She was an unofficial liquor distributor. She even helped smuggle guns to the Mexican Rebels although she wasn't paid for that volunteer work to help one of her favorite male lovers who was a Mexican Air Force officer. That little adventure almost landed her in jail but her instincts and luck saved her from the wrath of the Treasury Agents. This is a page-turner that is difficult to put aside. Even the photographs are interesting both because most weren't taken at the actual time of their subject's notoriety, but after the famous bordellos had practically collapsed back into the dessert landscape. The women, for the most part, were not what would be considered pretty by today's standards, but in the boom town pioneer days, the isolation and heavy drinking probably made all the working girls of Millie's Brothels look like angels to their lonely, love starved, overworked clients.  Not only do the characters in this biography not look like Hollywood versions of themselves, but also they don't act like the Hollywood stories either. They are much more interesting and much more plain spoken. This is a fun read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VPMDQKI0G29U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0826327834#wasThisHelpful","R2VPMDQKI0G29U","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most people imagine empty mansions as abandoned, decaying, cobweb-filled derelict structures. This story is about vast private estates maintained for absent owners for decades by loyal property managers, gardeners, maids, butlers and other household staff, most of who had never seen or met their employers. The fabulous city apartments and palatial estates overlooking the Pacific, in NYC and in the N.E. Countryside  were always ready for a visit by their owners and everything was kept ready for such an unexpected visit. Most of these mansions included ""panic rooms"" for hiding from ""bad guys."" The NYC W.A. Clark home on Fifth Avenue included a special suite in the tower that was designed to hide in case of an epidemic hit the city. It was a ""quarantine and panic room (suite)"" combined.The costs of maintaining these properties cost millions of dollar a year. Who could afford such costs?  Few people have heard of an American named William A. Clark, who rivaled John D. Rockefeller as the richest man in the world. Residents or visitors to Las Vegas might notice the county in which the city is located is called Clark County, but even then they probably have no idea which Clark the name referred to. If they guessed it would probably be the Clark from the Lewis and Clark Mapping Expedition. Among other ventures, using his own fortune, W.A. Clark had the foresight to build a railroad from Salt Lake City on the Inter-Continental Line to a sleepy port town called Las Angeles. Along the way he built a railroad maintenance stop that was to become Las Vegas and sold plots of the railroad right of way to prospective developers of that land. His nickname was ""The Copper King."" He was also an infamous U.S. Senator, the political story of which is one of the more  interesting parts of this book. This book is about his family and what became of his huge fortune. Frankly, this reviewer finds the most interesting parts of this rags-to-riches story to be about the founder and how he created the great family fortune. How the heirs ran through their inheritance is always of secondary interest to me. But in this case, the daughter, Huguette Clark, who lived to be 105 years of age was more interesting than the usual tales of heirs who simply squander their inheritances at near light-speed. In this case daughter of W. A. Clark, Huguette Clark wanted privacy more than anything else and she found it hiding in a hospital room for decades as the hospital and staff systematically extorted money from her. She was perfectly healthy most of the years she spent in the hospital, she just liked it there. Paintings were being stolen, but not reported to police because she didn't want any publicity. The Bank Trust Company where her jewelry was stored for safe keeping forgot to pay the paltry fees on the safe deposit box where the bank kept it and it was all eventually sold at auction for pennies. It's fascinating to see how those institutions and people who are supposed look out for a person's wealth and health so utterly failed. This is the story of a woman of wealth who used the money more or less to provide privacy for herself and to make occasional donations from the vast fortune she had inherited. Once the story switched completely from ""The Copper King"" to his ""copper heiress"" the book is much less interesting. It is fascinating, however, to observe how the subject of this book seemed to feel she would live forever and what she did about it. This is a page-turner for the most part, but it definitely goes down hill once the main character is able to buy her privacy. It's really three major stories tied together and they are not all equally interesting to every reader. And as of this reviews publication date, the final estate hasn't been settled. It appears that the IRS and state tax departments of CT, NY and CA, etc., along with legions of lawyers will get most of the remaining fortune.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R391570YVZP1V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534522#wasThisHelpful","R391570YVZP1V4","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Too exciting to put aside"" best describes this detective action novel. It caused this reviewer to seriously neglect some of his other activities. Since college I've mostly read biographies and other non-fiction books for information. This book was a rare exception in that it was read entirely for entertainment and escapism. It may mark the beginning of a new interest in reading and reviewing fiction? Admittedly, this reviewer also loves everything Japanese so that fact may have colored the enjoyment that came from devouring this particular thriller. Half of it takes place in Japan and half in the USA. The book has lots of interesting characters and provides some real insights into Japanese business, politics, history and art. The general public's picture of the highly efficient government workings of Japan that is almost universally accepted as fact isn't as perfect as promoted. The exposes included in this novel will cause some Japanese to either cringe or silently nod in agreement. This is a 400-page page-turner with lots of cliffhangers. The book moves quickly because most chapters run from two to six pages. As the reader finishes one chapter he is drawn into the next because it's so short that it won't take long to read it. This could easily become the first of a series. It would also make a good movie because it appeals to both the Japanese and American audiences. In a film, there will be lots of opportunities for a large supporting cast to make their mark. This is the most exciting first novel that this reader has read in years. It very much reminds me of Michael Crichton's ""Rising Sun, which was both an excellent book and terrific movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZH0Y8JMG0687/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451691696#wasThisHelpful","R2ZH0Y8JMG0687","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one of the characters in ""Late Early Man"" says, ""I'm more Drama than Documentary."" As a reviewer I seldom read fiction and almost never read collections of short stories and that puts me squarely in the Documentary, nonfiction, non-drama part of the quote, so these tales by Ralph Lombreglia were a pleasant surprise for me. As an ex-documentary filmmaker from Boston I particularly enjoyed the ""Late Early Man"" because of the subject and the Boston locale that is so perfectly captured. The author has a unique way of summarizing feelings and events and seeing both the truth and humor in them.  After reading these stories the reader will never again forget the adventures in birthing that came while filming the ""Great Power Sander Races."" All of these stories had previously been published in magazines such as ""The New Yorker"" and ""The Atlantic"" which pretty much guarantees that the author had something useful to say in a highly professional and entertaining manner. This collection is nine fun reads.

"""Today's journalists make a mockery of the word. They are nave, even sometimes downright stupid. They are undisciplined, not just in the preparation but in the delivery of news. They cannot, or just will not distinguish between news and information. They are pawns for misinformation and practiced in disinformation. They are loud, condescending, arrogant, dishonest, foolish, incompetent, mean-spirited--and dangerous."" ""On Election Night, at our behest, the McLaughlin Associates polling firm asked some questions along these lines in their omnibus survey. ""The first question we wanted answered was the degree to which the public believed the news media had helped to reelect Barack Obama versus those who believed they were helping elect Mitt Romney. Take out those who believed the press was neutral, or who had no opinion and you're left with Obama 84.8 percent, Romney 15.2 percent."" This poll was taken when it was assumed that Romney would win the election. As I write this review there are 6 other supposed reviews of the book that consider the book absolute lies and fantasies? It's difficult to believe these people actually read the book because it's obviously so well researched and the conclusions are footnoted. Even if one doesn't agree with every conclusion in the book it's totally ridiculous to deny the obvious truths contained in it. In an introduction and 12 chapters plus an epilogue and detailed notes and an index. The general public knows that the so-called ""mainstream media"" is heavily biased to the liberal left. That's probably why the number of people who follow the mainstream media has been dropping like a piece of burning hot volcanic lava for the past 30 years. Even the media admits that they overwhelming vote (almost 9 to 1) for Democrats over Republicans. This is a good book to give a friend that doesn't really know that he or she is actually relatively conservative but automatically votes for the party that the media has been claiming represents the little guys over the rich. If the public schools provided even a little bit of economic education along with ""individual thinking and questioning classes,"" voters might actually believe what their lying eyes are showing them over some of the nonsense the liberal media constantly pushes as fact. This book is definitely a page-turner and gushes with common sense. And the title of this review comes from a warning from the authors not to attempt to control the news media through the government. ""It's a free country--at least, for now, mostly--and the national news media have the freedom to present Obama as the finest naked emperor that's ever lived. We must also salute that freedom, and defend it always."" Then the author makes some suggestions for showing the media's untruthfulness in a manner that will actually reach people who don't even bother with following the news.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLC7Z512COUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062274724#wasThisHelpful","R1WLC7Z512COUK","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This title reminds me of ""Dow 36,000"" by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett that I read back in 1999 and we all know what happened not long after the book was published. In the case of ""$10,000 Gold"" and ""Dow 36,000"" the question the reader has to ask themselves is, ""Sure, both events will happen someday, but when and will the dollar be worth anything at that time?"" This is an excellent book for explaining the role gold has always played in history. It is also an excellent guide to investing in gold's various forms including jewelry (based on weight of gold, not artistic design), coins, ingots, bars, mining stocks, mutual funds, etc. Maybe the best point made by this tome is that owning gold is like insurance. It's a way of protecting wealth rather than making a quick buck buying and selling it although lots of speculators, hedge funds and option players do that as well.  It's a wealth protection for when money and other assets depreciate. This reviewer disagrees with the authors main point that uncompromised bullion is the best way to own gold. Bullion bars need to be assayed when sold to guarantee the gold is the quality stated because it's very easy to fake paperwork and serial numbers.  With numbered bars there has already been some reported problems by the pros. Recently several gold bars purchased by a big-time jewelry maker, turned out to be gold-plated tungsten bars. Scarier, there is still a rumor circulating that many of the gold bars held by the Federal Reserve Bank in NYC as well as some of the holdings at Fort Knox are gold plated Tungsten bars. This rumor has been hushed up to prevent a worldwide panic. The advantage with holding bullion gold coins is that like the silver dollars of the Wild West they can be cut into smaller sections. When silver dollars were cut into quarters the resulting piece was known as 25 bits or 25 cents. Even in the Wild West some of the gold coins were not actually what the mint claimed. Mormon Gold Coins were often only 90% of the claimed value. Now of course, those same coins are extremely valuable to coin collectors. But that wasn't so back when they were a regular form of payment. This is an excellent, generously illustrated with helpful charts and graphs, 298-page introduction to the history of gold and how to collect gold for the reader's personal portfolio.  It's definitely a page-turner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z1Y1CNPYI8HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118443500#wasThisHelpful","R2Z1Y1CNPYI8HJ","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is indeed a wonderful, insightful, politically incorrect and fascinating peek into the mind of one of America's greatest Film Makers. Orson Wells was not just a child prodigy, he remained a genius throughout his life and continued to try and fulfill his dreams in film production. Unfortunately, his films cost a lot of money and he eventually reached a point that nobody would risk their hard-earned cash on one of his projects. He had a nasty reputation for not finishing the films he started before going off to another project. He knew his problem and even candidly commented that the studios would not back his projects because he'd never made them any money. Wells was lucky in that his two biggest successes--the radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Citizen Kane"" occurred early in his career. They made him famous and because of that he was able to mix with the notables of the world as an equal. He knew everyone. In 27 chapters Orson Wells talks about the many people he has known. While there is lot of extraneous information about his other interests, opinions and politics, this book is largely about filmmaking and the film industry. From that stand point it was just a tad disappointing. Some times the general public forgets just how incestuous and petty show business can be. No matter how detailed Hollywood has been described by insiders, it is much worse--it really is a swamp of dangerous vipers. For folks who lived in Las Angeles in the 1970's and 1980's, Orson's unofficial office at a private table inside Ma Maison from the time it opened in 1973 until it shut down shortly after Wells died was well known. There were rumors that if he wasn't busy, outsiders could actually stop by and visit with him for the cost of a bottle of champagne, which they then shared. From reading this book, that rumor was probably false. Wells detested anyone, even acquaintances, who sat down at his table without being invited. My wife and I lived in Beverly Hills for a couple of years during that time period. We often talked about whether we should act like the out-of-towners we considered our selves and see if we could go by Ma Maison and meet the great Citizen Kane. We never followed through on that tourist tendency because we had three small kids; Ma Maison was very expensive and because we felt we really didn't have anything to say that would interest the great Orson Wells. We probably made the correct choice, but we will never know for certain. Who knows? We might have caught him at just the right moment? Also I happen to have a truly beautiful wife and perhaps her red hair would have reminded Orson of one of his ex-wives, actress Rita Hayworth? Wells and his movie-making friend Henry Jaglom shared enough experiences and goals that Wells could relax with him over long lunches even though he knew Jaglom was recording everything said during their meals together. Wells no doubt loved having that historic record made of his casual conversations. And being Orson Wells, he probably never really let down his guard for a moment. What he wanted history to know he would say in an entertaining way. His secrets would remain his secrets. But he was the great Orson Wells, and he made certain what he was saying was entertaining and never, never boring. This is a very good read. It flows along like the lyrics of the Stephen Foster song about the Swanee River. One can almost still hear the wonderful, deep voice of Orson Wells as he ""just keeps rolling along.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REE4VPH842RFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805097252#wasThisHelpful","REE4VPH842RFQ","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to imagine fighting hand-to-hand combat against Troy, Sparta, Babylonia, the Egyptians, or any other ancient nation state clad in armor made from Linen. But apparently the legendary warriors of ancient times conquered the known world and then ruled those lands for nearly a thousand years while wearing this homemade body armor. That is the obvious conclusion of this book. This cloth fabric body armor is called linothorax (also Type IV Armor) and this study of that ancient armor and it's use is called ""'The Linothorax Project' and was an exercise in reconstructive archaeology that has attempted to illuminate some of the mystery surrounding this type of armor. This project, which began at the University of Wisconsin--Green By in 2005 had four main goals"" all of which were answered by this scientific study. The main problem with the study of Linothorax armor in ancient times is that none of has survived although it possible that some will eventually be found in a glacier or tomb where it has not disintegrated? There are however, 913 images of this Type IV linothorax armor and the authors have comprised a database of all these images that date from the periods in question. The images include paintings from Pompeii, paintings on ancient pottery, base relief's, and freezes. The book's cover is a detail of Alexander the Great from the ""Alexander Mosaic"" from the House of the Faun, Pompeii and is thought to be a copy of a Hellenistic Greek painting. Working from the nearly a thousand images of warriors wearing Linothrox armor the authors recreated some of that armor using only the materials and tools available at the period when it was worn. They then took the materials and tested them in a variety of ways to see how many layers were needed to stop an arrow of the period from penetrating the linen armor. They also made armor using the various designs suggested by the contemporary illustrations of that armor. Among the conclusions the study reached were that linen armor was not only effective against the weapons of the era, but that the linen armor had lots of advantages over the heavier metal armor that came later in history. For one thing the armor was light and enabled the troops wearing it to travel farther and quicker. It was more flexible. It was very inexpensive to manufacture and easy to repair. It didn't rust. It didn't cook the soldier wearing it in the hot sun. It was actually superior to heavy, inflexible armor. The study didn't answer all the questions about linothorax armor; such as why in so many of the surviving images and illustrations of warriors wearing the armor was it so short. In many cases, it appears the armor didn't completely cover the genitals of the wearer. The most logical conclusion the authors came up with was that it was better that way for riding horses where the soldier wasn't so exposed to attack at the vital location.The book authors didn't explore the possibility that in ancient warfare that it wasn't considered fair to strike below the belt. They were wise to avoid any attempt at serious discussion of that theory. This is a very readable and short book for an academic study. It will make the reader keep an eye out for any archeology reports about an actual sample of the linen armor somehow being discovered in a sealed tomb or in of a ""freak of nature"" preserved environment like that of the Ice Man Discovered in an Alps glacier many years ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30I6WOHK8OXFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421408198#wasThisHelpful","R30I6WOHK8OXFG","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This biography depressed me. As one of the 90 million fans of Capp's satirical comic strips, it's sometimes depressing to find out about the real personality of a popular celebrity. That's one of the problems with biographies; the subjects usually die at the end of the book. Al Capp was an incredible success story of a boy who lost his leg trying to catch free rides on street cars, who grew up to become one of the most famous cartoonists of all time. Only Walt Disney and Robert Ripley had such shooting star careers to the top of their cartoon art fields. When Al Capp was at the height of his success he was a popular guest on television talk shows, had his own television show, and his face grace the covers of most major magazines including Time, Life, Newsweek and TV Guide to name just a few. He was making more than $500,000 per year. His Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae cartoons were eagerly followed by most of America's population. And Capp used that soapbox to satirize ""the affectations and hypocrisy of the powerful."" As the reader will learn by reading this biography, Capp was not the naive and loving Hill Billy of his fantasy world. He had a thing for beautiful young women but didn't like to take ""no"" for an answer in anything he did. Like many other rich and powerful celebrities, his fame protected him from his ""out of control"" sexual appetites. His predatory sexual habits finally caught up with him and ruined his popularity with the public. He simply couldn't keep his hands off young college coeds or aspiring actresses such as Goldie Hawn. Capp had a huge ego, but believed completely in the ""casting couch."" He was not the patient type and he preferred making his conquests by deceit instead of limiting himself to his many willing and available groupies. This true story is very readable and the audience will be familiar with much of the material, but it's still a bit of a downer for all of us who spent their youth and even young adulthood anxiously awaiting the next humorous and harmless adventure in Dog Patch. Hopefully his creations will outlive Capps own true story or at least the more depressing aspects of his fall from grace.Al Capp fans might be interested to know that there is a 1991, 127-page autobiography of All Capp with an introduction by John Updike that is a collection of Capps writings about himself and his creations. Some of it is really great and the book is titled ""My Well Balanced Life on a Wooden Leg-Al Capp"" and it's available on Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QXVEWVF1CDKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608196232#wasThisHelpful","R1QXVEWVF1CDKJ","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's easy to see why this author has such a popular blog. What she says rings true to both men and women. Since I'm a male, I suspect her truths may seem much more on the mark for female readers. This may be the first economics, self-help book that is a true page-turner. The author's 258 pages of economic theory are separated into nine chapters and a brief summary of her final thoughts and her ""final, final words"" are a blast to read. The chapters have titles like ""Love the One You're With, Hooking up in College, Love in Cyberspace, You Complete Me, Marriage is a Fine Institution, Bringing Home the Bacon, The Next Generation Comes of Age, Naughty by Nature"" and ""Love in the Sunset (Years)."" This author has some really intriguing economic theories about how technology is changing the marriage market to such an extent that the educated are creating high-income couples to the extent that it is widening the poverty gap in every country. It used to be that highly educated and highly paid people were so busy it was difficult for them to find each other. Many marriages happened between one highly paid or rich individual and a much poorer, less educated mate. And in the case of the less educated and motivated classes, two poor people would produce more future poor and often no marriage at all. While the Internet is making it possible for high income and highly educated individuals to locate superior mates, the changes that contraception has brought to sexual relationships has also effected the economics of marriage and family. The highly educated and motivated don't have to give up sex while they pursue their ideal mate. They have time to keep looking and experimenting. Another change the author discusses in detail is that women now out number men at all levels of college and higher education. They are rapidly moving into the ranks of the highest paid and best-educated workers. This influx of females into the highest professional ranks has already changed the nature of society. It has made women totally independent and that's something new in the world. ""But while educated women are becoming liberated to marry whomever they please, those same forces will essentially disenfranchise less-educated women from the marriage market and potentially, push more children into poverty."" The author speculates ""male income inequality encourages polygamy while female educational inequality encourages monogamy, so this suggestion that polygamy is the solution to growing female education inequality is counterintuitive. But the claim that female inequality encourages monogamy depends on the assumption that educated women are a relatively scare resource, which is no longer true. That suggests that, over time, having multiple educated wives will become `affordable' by wealthy men."" She doesn't say so, but following her own ""supply and demand"" logic, many wealthy women may also decide to have more than one husband. The book is written with lots of study results, but also with lots of humor and sex is the subject being discussed in economic terms. For a happy ending the book discusses ""the Big Mac Index that is produced annually by the `The Economist' magazine. The point of the index is to make exchange rate theory more palatable to readers by giving a real-world example of how well `purchasing power parity'--the theory that exchanged rates adjust to make the level of goods and services that can be purchased with a unit of currency equal between countries--holds around the world. `The Economist"" does this by comparing the price of a uniform, tradable good--a Big Mac--in about 120 different countries. The idea is that by converting the foreign price of a Big Mac into U.S. dollars, we should be able to determine if a country's currency is either over-or undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar."" ""Okay, so here is the big idea: the BJ Index."" That index is exactly what it says and the reader will be laughing as they follow the discussion of this new economic index to Dollars and Sex.

"Not only is this Secret Bank exempt from the taxes and oversight of any nation in the world, but also has been that way since it was founded in 1930. This is the inside story of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) which is based in Basel Switzerland but does not answer to Swiss authorities or anyone else. It is the world's Central Bankers own bank. Learning about this super secret Super Bank will add much credence to the conspiracy theory of the bankers trying to create a New World Order. It's like a shadow world government that is so powerful and useful that no nation in the world is willing to try and control or shine the spot light into its dark recesses. The world's most exclusive and powerful club has only eighteen members most of whom are men. The power and influence they exercise is almost unbelievable. It is said the Nazi's didn't invade Switzerland because they didn't want to cut off their access to this institution, which is where they shipped much of the wealth they striped from the nations they invaded. The book contains an introduction and sixteen information packed chapters contained in three major sections. Those chapters are titled ""The Bankers Know Best, A Cozy Club in Basel, Hitler's American Banker, An Arrangement with the Enemy, The German Phoenix Arises, The Rise of the Desk-Murders, The Tower Arises, The Second Tower, The All-Seeing Eye, (despite the familiar sounding names this is not ""Lord of the Rings"") and the Citadel Cracks."" ""The Tower of Basel reaches only eighteen stories above the city skyline, but the fate of the biblical tower-builders should give the bankers pause. For When God saw their work, he confounded their speech and introduced a multitude of tongues. The builders could no longer understand one another. The construction work stopped, they were dispersed and their town vanished into history."" The bank is fighting for its survival by trying to evolve into a socially responsible institution. ""Secrecy, opacity, and unaccountability--like gold--are embedded in the bank' DNA. The bank may find it can't continue as it has since its birth. This in a wonderful investigative report on one of the most secret and powerful institutions in world history. A reader doesn't have to like economics or banking to be mesmerized by this highly readable expose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZ1EIU0VACDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161039254X#wasThisHelpful","RDZ1EIU0VACDT","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I seldom read and review fiction this story was surprisingly well written and also gave me nightmares. I couldn't believe it actually caused me to lose some much needed sleep.Obviously that's a sign of a powerful story well told.The story starts out relatively slowly and provides the reader with an education in the history of paper and ink making since the story's narrator is an expert in authenticating rare books and manuscripts. He has a gift for being able to know whether something is fake or real. That and other needed historical and geographical information is skillfully woven into the book's over-all plot. The information about Serbian-American Inventor Nikola Tesla and his work with A/C electricity and George Westinghouse is particularly interesting. That material actually fits seamlessly into the story when it taking place in Eastern Europe and at the Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.The book's story line very much reminds the reader of the 1999 Roman Polanski motion picture ""The Ninth Gate"" and because of that the reader may find him or herself visualizing Johnny Depp as the main character. That's not really a problem since the physical description of the main character resembles Johnny Depp.It won't take the reader long to realize this isn't one of the popular Twilight Vampire movie series. There are no lovesick werewolves wailing at the moon over the loss of their Vampire girl friend.The book is definitely a page-turner once the reader gets into it. It can easily be read in a single day and night, but this reader preferred to take his time and savor some of the interesting language the author's uses. He has a knack for summing feelings up in a way most people have not heard before.At this relaxed pace it took this reviewer three days to read the 338-page tale. That was probably the reason for two nights of fleeting nightmares. As the author wrote in one of his many understatements, ""There is something unsettling about meeting a creature not human.""Once the entire book was finished, there were no more nightmares because the story had been completed.  Some of the descriptions of the birthday parties in this book will chill your blood.This novel is so well written the reader won't be able to get enough.

"This book will make most hardworking Americans mad as hell.  In 51 brief chapters, Wayne Allyn Root translates the writings on the wall and shows the reader exactly how Obama plans to turn the United States into a Third-World Socialist basket case. This is not new information; it's just that its various parts are becoming more transparent now that Obama has been re-elected. ""This is the Obama plan. He has to demonize, punish, and bankrupt the middle class, upper middle class, and small businesses (`the rich'), all in pursuit of `fairness'--in reality, misery for everyone. And it's all happening right in front of our eyes."" ""Get ready to celebrate Obama's new national holiday: DEPENDENCE DAY."" This book is divided into three major parts with lots of brief, but to the point chapters. The First Part, ""Obamagedon: The Disaster We Are Facing"" helps explain what is happening right now in sixteen chapters. Part II is titled ""How to Survive, Thrive, and Prosper during the next four years of the Obama Disaster."" The fourteen chapters comprising that section has chapter titles such as ""Learning to Use Y-PODS: Your Personal Defense Shield"", ""Your Precious Metals Defense System,"" ""Rare Coins,"" ""Diversify and Invest Outside the U.S.A.,"" "" Guns for Protection and Profit,"" ""Escape from High-Tax States,"" Back to Commonsense Advice"" and many others that deal with those subjects. Part III, ""Business Superstars Offer Their Advice"" consists of nineteen chapters written by successful businessmen. Some of them use their own names, many prefer to remain unidentified, but they all relate personal experiences such as how much money and resources can be saved by leaving the high-tax states and even moving out of the U.S.A. One expert and his family retired to Panama for several good reasons and while they were happy there, they eventually returned to Texas. For most readers the information on how to protect yourself and your family will be the most interesting. While some advice may seem wrong now, like investing 35% of your net worth in precious metals, the advice is actually very sound. The markets go up and down, but some things maintain their value no matter what happens. The over-all advice is to not have all your eggs in one basket and what kind of eggs to collect. The readers are certain to pick up some valuable and useful advice for this book.And the readers must consider that once the government caused disaster happens, that the same people will still be in charge of solving the mess they created.

"This book, which is actually two books combined, consists of a fictional biography (actually a fake biography about a fictional character-not a fictional biography of an actual person) and a second book is the fictional Surgeon's lost magnum opus: ""The Codex Extinct Animalia"" a ""Gray's Anatomy"" for mythological beasts such as dragons, mermaids, centaurs, Pegasus and Cerberus to name only a few. The second the book arrived from Amazon Vine and when the package was opened, the book reeked of Gothic texture. The very volume itself seemed to give off dark vapors and scents of Edgar Allen Poe and H. P. Lovecraft. Normally I only review non-fiction, but this pure fantasy slipped by me when I was making my two Amazon Vine selections. It's one of those books that if I had actually examined in a bookstore that I probably wouldn't have bought. It was interesting to thumb through, but otherwise it wasn't my cup of tea, or my poison. The book uses some of the same techniques of writing fiction that was done so well by Michael Crichton. His fictional locations were so believable that at the end of the book the locations always had to be destroyed by burying them under miles thick lava or some other technique that would make them impossible to locate and visit. In the fictional biography of this combined set, The life and Writings of Dr. Spenser Black is described in seven short chapters each one being another chapter in the Doctor's life: ""1851-1868: Childhood,"" ""1871-1877 Marriage and Transformation,"" etc. etc. The doctor was believed to be a grave robber like his own surgeon father. In 1877, ""Black speculated that perhaps the human being is not the best result of evolution; perhaps our ancestors shared traits with some of the ancient animals or, more accurately, ancient mythological animals. Black claimed that scientific evidence proving the existence of ancient mythological animals had been concealed by unnamed parties; taxonomy records were destroyed, constellation records were changed, fairy tales were altered and rewritten, all in an attempt to ignore our true history."" The doctor felt that the fact human beings might not be the highest species on the planet had been concealed from the public and was forced to exist only in mythology and fairy tales. ""The Codex Extinct Animalia"" is the collection of Dr. Black's anatomy studies of mythological animals. Only a single copy has survived and is the source of the meticulous anatomical drawings in the volume. The real author and artist of these two fantasy books is E.B. Hudspeth who lives in New Jersey and he may well be on his way to becoming a cult figure himself. He has a good imagination, a way with words as well as a talent with pen and ink and anatomy drawings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277QF99NK0RFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746168#wasThisHelpful","R277QF99NK0RFL","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most people who choose to read this biography by Zev Chafets, I'd heard lots of rumors about Roger Ailes over the years. He'd built Fox News Channel from scratch after getting a billion dollars in start up funds from Rupert Murdock. Prior to that he was rumored, credited with being the campaign manager for Richard Nixon's successful Presidential race, for coaching Presidents George H. W. Bush and later Ronald Reagan. The man had come from nowhere, Warren Ohio, to be exact, and found his interest in media while attending Ohio University in Athens Ohio at the college radio station WOUB. He served as the WOUB Radio student station manager before moving on to a television career beginning in Cleveland and later Philadelphia where he became Executive Producer for ""The Mike Douglas Show."" It was a locally produced show when he arrived, but he helped turn it into a nationally syndicated program. For those readers looking for some ""fresh meat"" information about Roger Ailes, they won't find much of it in this biography. Roger's primary career has always been as a media, especially television, consultant. Since he began his professional career he has usually worked from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week.  That's how most successful businessmen make their marks--long, long hours of working and keeping their eyes on their long-term goals. Zev Chafets does a very professional job with his Ailes biography, but even he mentions that while Ailes, his friends and his employees were always forthcoming with the answers to his questions in this short 16 chapter book, he felt that Ailes was holding back some of the material that would be more interesting for a future autobiography that he wanted to write. Ailes also seems to follow that mid-western folk advice that ""if you can't say anything nice about somebody, don't say anything at all."" He doesn't reject any of the comments he's made in the past about various candidates, but he doesn't make a big deal about it. To him, his comments were his professional opinions as a media consultant about what happened and not any kind of personal or vengeful attack. The book is probably as interesting as Ailes let it be. There is lots of trivia about the people who he has hired and less about the people who he has had to  fire. Usually the firings were because the personality involved simply broke the company's published rules about loyalty and working with the team. It was interesting that several of those people who moved on to other media outlets such as ""Mad Money"" stock guru Jim Cramer were happy to contribute almost gushing praise for their former boss when interviewed by Chafets. Without exception they all felt that they had learned a great deal from their dealings with Ailes whom they considered not only a true professional, but almost a father figure. This is a very readable book and it probably paints as much of a biographical portrait of a high-powered political consultant as was possible under the circumstances. There simply isn't much in the way of scandal included in it. After Ailes finished his work with Richard Nixon he didn't get along with the new President's Staff so he cut all his ties with the new administration. Even when he was occasionally called in for some relatively short consulting, he refused to accept any payment or even Per Diem expenses for his advice. When the Watergate Plumbers Scandal Broke, Ailes was in Africa making a conservation documentary with Bobby Kennedy Jr.Maybe Ailes was just lucky but he is a person who believes that people make their own luck. The book did include some of his interesting observations about Nixon's character and method of working that hasn't been made public in the past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WMS3Z7MO744B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595230955#wasThisHelpful","R2WMS3Z7MO744B","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert L. Ripley left his California high school planning to be a semi-pro baseball player or maybe a cartoonist? Fortunately for the world's amusement, he became a cartoonist. But even after getting the break of a lifetime for a brand new sports cartoonist for the NY Globe, he almost ended up on the N.Y. Giants.  While covering the team in its Marlin Texas winter camp he was invited to work out with the team. The coach told another reporter that Ripley was the ""the best curve-ball I've seen in a long, long time. "" Fortunately, for the world, Ripley broke his arm in a 90-degree fracture while pitching. All that remains of his baseball career is a picture of him wearing a Giants Uniform and swinging a bat. Before long the rest of the press remembered him more as a poker player than a pitcher. The young cartoonist's big break had occurred in 1910 shortly after he'd started working at the San Francisco Chronicle. His editor picked him ""to be the lead cartoonist to cover the upcoming fight between retired champion Jim Jeffries and Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champ. The fight was billed as ""'The Great White Hope' versus `the Big Black Menace.'"" The fight had grown into one of the biggest sporting events in United States history. The fight was moved to Reno and the press went to Nevada several days early to watch the fighters prepare. Ripley ""met two of his Bulletin predecessors, Rube Goldberg and Tad Dorgan. Also sitting at the table was the famous and famously troubled `Call of the Wild' author Jack London."" For that fight, Ripley became a colleague with America's most famous western writer. He was greatly influenced by his exchanges with Jack London. Ripley became so `overawed' by this famous company that he almost missed ""The Battle of the Century"" because of a nervous stomach. He did get to his ringside seat to witness and record Johnson as he slowly ripped Jeffries apart in the 45 ROUND battle for the World Championship. 45 ROUNDS was apparently the norm for that boxing match. And anyone who can even last for 45 rounds has to automatically qualify as a superman. ""When the old champion went down and out, there was not one cheer for the winner "" was the caption on his cartoon of Jeffries lying on his side as the crowd looked on. Ripley became a success because he worked hard and had an incurable curiosity about everything he saw. Soon, his work expanded from sports coverage to covering the world. What he saw and was curious about he shared with his newspaper and their syndication partners. This is another of those fascinating, true rags-to-riches stories that is difficult to put aside until the final chapter is reached. And as the reader of this biography will quickly discover, Ripley was a bit of an odd ball himself. ""LeRoy Ripley, it turns out, may have been the most unbelievable oddity of all."" Definitely a very good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U6EIZHMNV8GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077043620X#wasThisHelpful","R2U6EIZHMNV8GK","A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I pulled it out of the package and wore it for the first time, it's definitely something you have to play around with, or it'll just kind of look a little flat on your head. The curls are definite, which I like how they spindle around each other.It's about 24 inches long (without straightening or pulling out the curls). The parting space is about 3 and a half inches. However, the parting space needs a little tweezer work done because it's very skinny. It has three combs and adjustable straps, and the cap is big enough for comfortable fit.It is curling iron safe becuase I curled it a bit to give it more body just over my eyes, and I ended up liking the wig more when I did that.The only thing I can't stand is the shine. Shine is like 'wig alert!'. It's just unnatural-looking, but the hair is very soft, and the hairline seems to work pretty well.I got mines from Divatress.com for around 35 bucks.Update 10/11/14I am DEFINITELY liking this wig. It's gorgeous! This is honestly one of the best wigs I've bought along with Vivica Fox Melrose wig. Those are pretty much the two realistic wigs I've ever bought. I will buy this unit again in the future. I love the body that it has, how I can flip the bangs over since the wig is in wonderful layers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MT8UHFHZNDWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBXE2A8#wasThisHelpful","R3MT8UHFHZNDWY","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just kind of stumbled upon these bags of Crunchmaster crackers. Curiosity got the best of me, and I picked up the Vegetable plus one other flavor I wasn't as excited about. Vegetable flavor won all the awards. I loved how the crackers were seasoned enough, becuase sometimes you pick up bags of chips or crackers that seem like they were forgotten to be seasoned.It doesn't really taste like vegetable, but at the same time, once your taste buds kick in, it's like I can ALMOST taste what specific vegetable it COULD be, but then it goes away. It's is very crunchy. Sometimes I wonder how loud I'm chewing around other people. I've gone into dipping the crackers into some Louisiana Creole dressing, which nearly sent me eating the whole bag in just a few minutes. This bag of crackers really does creep up on you if you don't count how many you're eating. Just  15 crackers are 130 calories. I especially like how there's fiber in these crackers.As far as the bag itself, it's about 8 inches tall. And of course as with nearly any product, it's almost halfway full. I measured 4 1/2 of free space left. Honestly, I would buy the individual bags at Wal-Mart for a cheaper price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R267SY4NGBAKVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060L6I9U#wasThisHelpful","R267SY4NGBAKVJ","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I'm not a fan of Justin Beiber, I had a 'sniff' sample of this perfume in a Teen Vogue magazine and liked it. A while later I bought it and it comes in this two-piece shell-like container, which measures about 7 1/2 tall. When it piece them together, it has this neat magnetic grip to protect the glass perfume bottle. I was able to lift it by the top container and it was still intact. The perfume bottle itself gives you like 5 inches in height. And and removing it from the containers is effortless.Once I had more experience with the perfume, my nose just lost interest for the fragrance. I appreciate that it's not one of those fragrances where it's so strong that it's hard to get rid of the smell unless you shower. I've had that happened before and it was terrible. I couldn't get rid of the smell in my room for about two days.I don't use it everyday. Sometimes I go a week and not use it. But when I get ready for college and if it's in my sight, I'll just spray some on for the sake of just smelling good in general.But given the price, it really does last you a good while. So, I guess the price is about right. I spray about two to three rounds on my body, but after that, I don't really smell it on me after at least 20 minutes go by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDWGE3NWDELD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VPCJ6O#wasThisHelpful","R2MDWGE3NWDELD","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent about $13 on these headphones. I don't used headphones everyday, but typically maybe 2 or 3 times a week. So, I was expecting them to last awhile, but I knew deep down, I'd soon be disappointed.Like one other reviewer said, the ear cushions do come off easily, at least just one of them. I nearly lost one and there were times I didn't realize it was off just when I was about to workout.One thing I truly love about the headphones was that it had just extra adjust volume feature along the cord. I liked that a lot becuase it just seemed like simpler way to control the volume. But that soon kind of turned into a bad feature because it eventually started working to wear the music would come out in one ear. So, I'd have to tap the volume adjuster here and there to return the the balance.I honestly would save your money. Only buy these headphones if you're not a heavy headphone user and just need it here and there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AG41540HIAIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000UV0IQ#wasThisHelpful","R2AG41540HIAIB","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few things I really don't like about this wig. I had been looking at Melorse for a VERY long time because I like how the curls spiral back around the head. And YES, they really do look like that in person.First of all, the hair is incredibly soft. I don't know if that will ever change once it ages, but it's really soft. It doesn't feel like that typical synthetic wig where the strands are a little hard. It reminds me of the Vanessa wig by FreeTress Equal, which feels the same way. The only difference is that Melrose has a much longer parting space, which I LOVE. It might be 3 and a half to 4 inches long. However, the parting space is only a centralized space, meaning you're restricted to that one area of parting space.When I put the wig on and tried to move the hair around, it seemed a little lazy to me. If you think about holding a banana peel by the tip or top, that's what it looked like on my head. It's like it was just sitting on my head and had no body. One other thing I dislike about Vivica Fox wigs is that it has that dome or hump shape. The wig is way too shiny, which gives off the 'wiggy radar'. But I really do like that around the hairline it looks as if it's growing out of my scalp.One other thing about the parting space is that is unrealistic. It looks glittery. I'll have to put some concealer over it and give it a better texture and color.The wig can curl. In fact, I've curled it a few times, cut some down a bit to give it some layers, and once I did that, especially around my eyes, the wig looked way better than the factory style.But my main problem is the shine, the dome-head, and the glittery parting space. I bought mines from Divatress.com with a new-member 10% discount code. The price alone was around 30 bucks. So, I would NOT spend $70 for this wig. You'd get ripped off twice over!10-11-14 UPDATEThe wig is still going beautiful. I honestly, would buy this again as the wig grew on me favorably. I got rid of the dome shape by just adjusting the straps and making it a little tighter. The curls are starting to loosen just a bit, which makes the wig longer. So, i'll have to put in more curls. The ends in some places are starting to have that rough texture. But that's with any wig with age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X36GEWV9SDFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4VQ3AM#wasThisHelpful","R2X36GEWV9SDFR","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The smell kind of relates near to Vanilla or French Vanilla actually. But the more you sniff, the more it actually does remind you of vanilla cupcakes. Cupcakes are my heaviest guilty pleasure, which compelled me to pick it up when I had never seen it before. I've bought over seven of these since wearing chapstick seems more fun now. And even the exterior designing of it, seems eye-pleasing. This almost makes me hungry.But it's not overpowering or anything like that, and the smell is not very lasting as in you can smell it while it's on your lips.

"I picked up this bottle in Wal-Mart some time in mid July becuase I was looking for a skin-toning and smooth texturing to my skin. I have uneven skin tone and dark marks. Now, today, September 10th, this product has not done a thing but leave my skin temporarily dry. I'd have to put on lotion after I rinse the product off. The dark spots are still there. It mentions brightening your skin, but again, I see no difference. I used this product twice a day; morning and night before bedtime. I even left it on my face probably longer than recommended as I'd put it on first, brush my teeth, and then rinse it off. I got NOTHING.

"This is really one of those disappointing experiences with a product I had high expectations for. And despite the many, MANY MANNNNY bad reviews warning us not to buy this, I still took the leap of faith and bought this only becuase it was within my budget at the time when I really wanted the Nutribullet or Nutri Ninja.First of all, I bought this magic bullet from an Ebay Seller named drugstoreinc. DO NOT buy from this seller as this seller will absolutely not respond to any email you give them. Don't believe me? Look at the store reviews. I tried to get in contact with them when my Magic Bullet suddenly stopped working after like 5 times of usage. And I take care of it as I normally keep it clean and store it back into the original box it came with. What happened was I was using the cross blade in which the recipe book it came with CLEARLY said it was for frozen fruit, ice, and things of that nature. All I had in the container were raw orange slices and lemon juice, and maybe even a small amount of ice. When I tried pressing down, I noticed the blade wasn't moving the stuff around. The motor was roaring, but there was no movement. It just made this really awful, almost high-pitched sound. I lifted the blade to see that there was some kind of white powdery stuff as if something was deteriorating or being scratched up. I noticed one reviewer said it was the plastic powder/shavings. I assumed that maybe the ice was too hard against the blade and the blade couldn't take it. Then again, the blade looked fine.After trying to get a hold of that idiot seller, I eventually contacted the official company of Magic Bullet and showed them pictures of it and what happened. This occurred over a series of emails. Since it wasn't clear if it was actually the blade or the motor, they were very nice enough to send me a brand new motor and the blade, but I had to pay $8 in shipping.So, I started using the second one...........Bummer, it happened again after maybe like 8 or 10 times of usage. And I made SURE to take care of this extra harder. I did not put ice in it this time. Instead, it was frozen fruit with some juice using the cross blade again. In fact, I tried using both flat and cross blades it came with, and it would not spin at all. All it does is make that sound as if the tires on a car are screeching but they're not really going anywhere. In fact, I think I could have sworn I smelled something burning. The company did tell me to cut the cord to the old motor for safety reasons. Ugh. So disappointed.Now, for the experience itself, the Magic bullet is not very powerful anyway. It does not necessarily grind up everything. It does come out lumpy, especially with oranges and grapefruits. But it worked successfully with the frozen fruit. But that was 58 bucks down the drain. Sorry I cannot give a full review on every piece it came with. I had only used it for the sole purpose of smoothies (fruit).But seriously, invest your money into something more promising. I do not trust this company's products and wonder if they even do inspections or investigations/followups on their own products.This was very disappointing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WCKWZRQFBVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001WAKFDY#wasThisHelpful","R8WCKWZRQFBVA","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**DVD Menu**You will see the following:- All Mini Walks (104 Minutes) and this can be with music or music only- Choose One of Leslie's Pre-planned Combinations: 1. Total Body Walk (53 minutes)`2. Advanced Walk (32 minutes) 3. Fun Walk (32 Minutes) 4. Choose One Mini walk - which will bring you to its own menu page where you can choose one. 5. Create your own custom walk - which will bring you to its own menu page where you can mix up the combinations. It will also allow you to play music only in whatever you choose. You can even choose the same mini walk twice if you like.** Experience**I chose to do all of the walks, which got tedious the more I went. According to my calorie count watch, I burned 846 calories surprisingly. Then again, I was moving for almost two straight whole hours. When I did this the second time, I burned 733.The All mini walks segment are as follows:1. Light Walk - According to Leslie, she wants you to use this mini walk as a warm-up. And that's exactly what it felt like. There is no jumping or anything brisk. Again, it feels like a warm-up or gentle walk.2. Dance Walk - You're not really dancing, but there is cha-chas, and Mambos. There are kicks toward the end but knee-lifts. There is no jumping.3. Walk, Kick + Jab - First, it starts out slow, and then it gets pretty brisk. You'll do mini squats that almost feel like side steps. You'll turn to the side and do side steps along with jab-cross movement. She also mixes in a kick with your double side steps. That move really took me off guard a bit, but I caught up. You'll also do some back taps while your arms swing forward and back. There is no jumping in this.4. Tummy Trimmer - It had a slow start and then it picked up in speed. She'll have you do regular skaters, but as you do double side steps, she'll ask you to tack on a skater along with that, which can be a little tricky. There are kicks and the knee lifts come with arms that will rise over your head and come down with your elbow touching to your hip. I really felt those in my core. There are no shifts, twists, or bouncing in this.5. Short & Sweaty - I was tricked on this mini walk as I assumed it was going to be a lot of jumping, bouncing, shifts, and all those high intensity moves, but all it is, is that you're going at a fast pace. The walk starts off already brisk and then gets brisker. The only hardest move for me was doing those twist side steps that almost make you have to hop.6. Interval Walk - You will have 3 interval rounds where you start off slow and then she'll have you run up 4, stay in place for 4, and then run back 4. This lasts about 60 seconds.7. Upper Body - It's pretty much self-explanatory. With almost every move you do, you'll do something with your hands like lateral raises, overhead press, chest press, pushing your hands back when you do kickbacks. One thing I noticed was that there were no knee-lifts.8. Lower Body - This mini walk got me teeth-gritting becuase she just had to include lunges. Lunges make me feel weird around the knee and ankles. You'll do squats with your feet close together along with other common movements like kicks.9. Brisk + Sweaty - It's just as the title says. You'll be moving pretty fast but there's no jumping or high intensity movements.10. Flexibility Walk - This is most definitely, or should be the last mini walk in your customize walk. It's very low-impact and really, probably the best cool down she's had in a long time, because she's not rushing through it.Now, at the end of of these mini walks, she'll kind of slow it down, but there's no cooldown up for each of them. The Flexibility walk is the walk for cooldowns. She kind of tricked me when at the end of the light walk, she started to breathe in and out with her hands stretched up and coming back. I thought she was going to stretch after that. But she said to keep walking if we're going to another mini walk or skip to flexibility walk for stretch.***Pros***1. The music is pretty leveled out. I could hear her very well as well as the music at the same time. So, this is not a DVD where you can hardly hear her, or can't hear the music at all.2. The music itself is pretty decent. It kind of reminds of a trance dance club just a bit. But it has a decent beat. There was one I really liked in the lower body mini walk.3. She gives one healthy tip in each of her mini walks. The one I loved the most was when she said it is very expensive to be unhealthy. And she's right. You don't want to visit the hospital all the time. Exercise and eat right, and your body will take care of you in return.4. Nobody on the set was annoying. I already know three of them, such as Nick from from Walk it off in 30 days, Tina from Walk to the Hits, and Nikki from her various DVDs back in 2012. So, there's only one new one there on the set and she moves with fire, almost motivating you to give your best. But there were a lot of powerful smiles. Nick has the best smile.***Cons***1. Leslie does get off step a lot. Sometimes even when a scene goes to another and then back to her, she's on a different step.2. Sometimes I've noticed they were not quite correlated with the beat, as if whoever put the DVD together kind of had a little botch in the audio. So, I'd be going to the original beat she had me on, but all of the sudden, they were either slow or fast for a few seconds.**Neutral**1. There is no time clock. But all should be 10 minutes. So, you have an idea of how long they are.2. I've noticed people have said in the past that she's pretty loud or talks too much. Sometimes her laughs can be exaggerated, but here, she's pretty laid back, very gentle.**other**I am 154 pounds if it helps. So, if you're around my size, you can definitely get this done. My mother is in her early 50's and has lost around 10 pounds doing Leslie DVDs. Leslie has helped me lose 11 pounds so far. So, the stuff works. If you have questions, please ask. I'm connected to my email daily.Overall, I think the best part about this DVD is just that you have more power and options to set up your workout out the way you want it. If you're just too tired, pick out gentle walks. If you want a challenge, you can even pick the toughest mini walks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XK8ETCAX1IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KASQQTQ#wasThisHelpful","R16XK8ETCAX1IX","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was walking through a grocery store here in Louisiana, and this woman was advertising the different products/dressings, including this particular one. She said the creole tomato dressing was their special one. I gave it try and ended up asking for seconds. Due to being on a budget at the time, I could not buy it.I passed the dressing quite a few times later on until I finally bought it to have for a vacation snack. Painfully, it is expensive. It was $7 a jar. But I later realized that this stuff really does last long depending on how much you consume it.This stuff is so good that I could not stop dipping crackers into it. I soon turned to dipping shrimp and other seafood as well. I have not tried it on salad yet; didn't get to that part. But it almost reminds me of an all-purpose dressing. And it had me losing track of how much I was really eating it. It was perfect! The taste is really hard to describe. It does not taste anything like tomato, but almost resembles that special type of sauce you'd expect to be in a little cup that goes along with seafood at seafood restaurants.The only bad thing about it is that it's about 85 calories for ONE tablespoon and is 14% total fat, and 10% in saturated fat. All this in one tablespoon. So...it's bad. I don't even feel good mentally when I know I'm putting this stuff inside my body.But it's delicious. I just wish it was healthier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXJCS51QI2ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2BR4O6#wasThisHelpful","R3TXJCS51QI2ZH","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If it helps, I have African American skin. I wanted something to help aid in healthy skin. I used this for months, twice a day in the morning and before bedtime.Around the first few months, I massaged the foam with my fingers onto my face as it turned into foam once you move it circular motion. After a few seconds, the form disappears, but the stuff is still on your face. Then it says to rinse your face. Afterward, it left my face so dry that it felt like my face wanted to stretch from being so stiff. Sometimes I had to resort to putting on lotion afterward to get rid of that irritable feeling. I do have oily skin. But sometimes the extreme dryness was just too much.I then got a rotating facial brush and used CeraVe with that, thinking if I applied by a different method other than my fingers, I could probably see some results. I also left the foam on my face longer by putting on first, then brushing my teeth, and after my teeth are clean, I then rinse my face. But I got the same outcome.It does not have a smell, nor have I experienced it bothering my eyes.I still experienced acne. So, this wasn't any kind of miracle worker for me.I gave it two stars for two reasons, 1) It did not seem to make my skin worse. So, that's a plus. And 2) becuase for $8 to $10 you really do get your money's worth in terms of quantity. It's a big bottle and it will take forever to use every bit of it. But I'm down to at least 25% left, and I don't think I'm even going to bother with the rest. I'm now moving on to another product. There's no reason for me to even waste my time any further this foam. But at least it was worth a shot.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176HMJYD2H6FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YMJJSK#wasThisHelpful","R176HMJYD2H6FG","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For size reference I was between 166-163 pounds, I am 5'4, with chest 39 inches and was able to fit this with a breeze. It feels VERY lightweight and goes well with some skinny jeans, ripped or smooth.It covers the chest area very well and the tail end in the back does cover my butt cheeks entirely. I did notice near the strap area that on both sides it's tied in faint knots. I believe if you loosen that a little you can probably adjust the length of the straps.It is a tad darker in person, but overall, it's a good little tank to have for the summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AK8S24BM1B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0NPWCA#wasThisHelpful","R27AK8S24BM1B0","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I pulled the wig out of the package, it came in these medium waves. It barely had any body. Yes, the wig is very long. It has two combs up front, but oddly, there's no comb in the back. There is no lace around the forehead at all. The only lace you see, is the parting space, which is about 3 inches long. So, it's not really that much for a wig so jacked up in price. It also does have adjustable straps.There is no shedding at all. Yes, the wig can curl. Please look at the video I uploaded to help you get an idea of how it looks curled. This is in a 1B. I did curl it with a curling iron and pinned the curls closed until they cooled down, and then I released them. I have to say, they look really good.I gave it three stars because I hate the hairline. There is nothing natural about it. You do have to be careful up front becuase I could see where the track begins. The only reason they made a big deal about this wig was becuase of the 'invisible L' part. But it's not really all that great and even all that realistic looking. Plus, you don't have a lot of diversity with wig to part it yourself. You might have to tweeze it a bit. But it was hard for me to adjust the wig on my head to a proper setting to make it look real. It's already if you need to get out and run some errands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FZNPY88NV51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCBHI04#wasThisHelpful","R11FZNPY88NV51","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not one to go crazy over any type of granola/nutritional bars or things of that nature. I gave this a try and realized I had been missing out. I've passed these Fiber One bars on the shelves so many times in Wal-Mart and can kick myself.For one, I like that it's high in fiber. I've had years of constipation and have tried many things. There was one time I ate three of these in one day, and the next day, I had to run to the toilet.The taste is very flattering. It does not taste like it has 'medicine' in it. It actually tastes fun, almost causing me to eat too many than I should. I try to eat them in between means for a little snack. The peanut butter taste is very real. They don't feel hard or feel like they'll break your teeth. They were always the right feeling to me.My calorie count profile gave this product a grade B.

"I'm 27 years old5'4 and in between 164-3 pounds and was able to complete this 60-minute workout.From the DVD menu the workout is broken down into sections if you do not wish to do all of them.Ada and her partners are situated on some kind of airship base with idled helicopters stationed in the background. Her partner's bodies give excellent motivation for me to continue my toning and firmness. They are very disciplined, helping you keep count of the repetitions, which seem to be 16-count for a set of moves almost every time.The first part is a lengthy warm-up, one that already made me fatigue a little, especially in my arms. This is about 7 minutes.The next part is the low impact aerobics. Some of the moves will frustrate you becuase of the long 16-repetitions. There are lunges, squats, lots of arm movement, knee-lifts, which will be exaggerated. But there is no hopping, running, or jogging. It's low impact, but because it's low, she's going to make you make up for it. This is about 25 minutes. But stopping at this level, I burned a little over 200 calories.The Strength training is dealing with weights of maybe 2 to 4 pounds. I would not go higher than that unless you're just a really big guy. You'll be standing for the dumbbell part. Then toward the end of the dumbbell, she work on the front and back squats, then some lunges. She'll then take you to the floor/mat where you'll work severely on the abdominal. Believe me, I FELT that workout, but it excited me becuase I knew it was working. She'll have you do tiny pulse sit ups and lots of them! She also aims at the buttocks as well. This is about 22 minutes.The last part is the total body stretch and that is 7 minutes. This DVD is definitely worth the money. I'd highly recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QDJ20RSUAH8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EJYCOG#wasThisHelpful","R2QDJ20RSUAH8L","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Menu Screen***1) Play Entire Belly Blast Walk2) Play Just the Belly Blast 2-Mile Walk3) Play Belly Blasting Floor Session 14) Play Belly Blasting Floor Session 2***PROS***I have way more than a pudgy stomach and have always hated it. I noticed in both miles she really fires up that area with some really good unique moves I had never seen her do in her other DVDs. These more are very effective. For example, when you do kicks, she'll make you hit your knees as if you have a hammer. I noticed when I did that, I could really feel my core fire up. There is a LOT of high intensity moves such as hopping, jumping, shifts, twists, and leg swings. Bre is there to modify the moves if you prefer a low-intensity workout.I was out of breath, my feet hurt,and she kind of got on my knees, which I should have wore a knee pad for this workout. You will need a sports bra or your stuff will jiggle :pThe first floor work session is my most favorite becuase she spends about 15 to 20 minutes targeting your abs in many different ways. I noticed when I woke up the next day, my stomach was sore. So, it's very effective stuff. Plus the music during this session is WAY comforting. I raised the windows to let the sunlight in, put on cool air and just relaxed through the session.I burned about 204 calories during the mile part.***CONS***I knocked one star off this rating becuase the music was tough to hear. That was the ONLY thing I disliked about the workout.She does tend to get off step a lot when she's trying to match with the music.***OTHER***Unfortunately, I can't review the floor session 2 part because it was too difficult for me. So, I apologize for that. All I know is that she makes you get on your stomach and tries to help you balance your weight on your core. I could NOT do that! So, I believe you're on your back in the first session, and on your stomach and knees on the second.This is worth buying becuase every time I did this workout, I felt my abs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BT8FSE70BSQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WHD9CS#wasThisHelpful","R2BT8FSE70BSQQ","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a 27-year-oldBetween 163-157 pounds***PROS***I do tons of Leslie Sansone workouts where I'm either twisting, jumping, bouncing, or jogging in place. Also I use a Stepper exercising machine. When doing both of these workouts, sometimes one or both of my knees began to feel a little pressured. So, I tried on the Bracoo knee support and actually did notice change, A LOT.When I'm on the stepper, my left knee is very relaxed and absent of pressure. Sometimes I forget about my knee or even wearing it. When I did the Leslie Sansone workout while bouncing, I noticed my knee was still improved.***CON***I'm a big disappointed that only one was packaged. I know it said it was only one, but when one knee improves, you want the other to feel the same. You can tell a difference between the two knees.***NEUTRAL***If you don't wrap it around your knee correctly, the part that suppose to stick on can irritate you or make you feel like something is stabbing into your skin. So, just take your time when you're putting it on. I'd recommend not too tightly.I've used this at least 8 times and it's going strong. It is definitely a big difference and when I take it off, my knee is still okay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUI2YE06IWZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BINV84#wasThisHelpful","RKUI2YE06IWZ1","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The directions say to leave the foam on for 4 minutes and do NOT exceed 10 minutes. Then it says to use a damp cloth to rinse it off, but don't rub. After that, rinse your whole leg thoroughly and then dry. It says to clean the actuator and replace cap between uses, which does not make a lot of sense considering it only came with one cap (somebody correct me if I'm not understanding).I've used this about three times and there's still half the bottle left. It has a good amount. I usually spray a thick coating over my legs just to avoid not being able to get some hairs removed and having to do it a second time. I don't spray my whole legs. I only spray the obvious hair areas. I have African skin with a huge problem with hair spots, and I'm just scared that using razors will just create more of them.I usually take a small towel, dip it in warm water and then apply it to my legs in circular motion. There is no pain or feeling of hair being yanked out. It just easily washes away. I have exceeded more than 4 minutes for sure, but even so, I have not felt any pain or stinging, etc. But you do feel like some chemical is on your legs; like you can tell there's a difference going on.Afterward, my legs do feel soft. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would say 2 about the some irritable feeling when you rub or touch your legs, but I usually apply lotion to make it all better.Would I buy this again? Probably not. I'm not entirely comfortable with chemicals on my skin.

"I am a 27-year-old woman5'4and between 163-157 poundsShoe size 8When I got this in the mail, I was too excited about it. It came in a two to three inch wide box with a set of instructions. It was already assembled, so all I had to do was just used it. I immediately put it on the floor and jumped on it. And to my amazement, this actually does get your abs fired up. It's not a machine, which I thought it was. It just has plates that help or make it easier for you twist your body, or give you that sensation that you want to twist.I did this for 30 minutes three days in a row. The first time, I watched a TV show with it. The second time, I played music worth 30 minutes, and then the third time, I watched another TV show. I developed what felt like a cramp below my ribcage but then it went away eventually. It is REALLY tough keeping this up for 30 minutes because once your stomach starts stinging, you want to get off. But don't, because it gets easier as you go. You have to move your arms side to side positioned at chest height to help you move. The instructions said to have one knee bent, which in some ways can be tricky because you feel you might step off balance. But I've had a habit of just keeping my legs straight. My balance abilities have actually been impressive. It's rare of me to step off unintentionally.Your arms also get tired as well. So, it's like you're getting a workout for your abs and arms. The instructions did say if you want to pump it up a bit use some weights. I tried that with 5 pounds but it was too much. Try 2 pounds. I also felt my bowel movements going to work. I love ANYTHING that makes me run to the toilet, especially when you have those days where you can't.**CONS**1) Some cons are that if you are barefoot on this, the structure of the plate can hurt or irritate your feet. I wore house shoes or sandals the second time and had no problem.2) I HATE that the plate twists around when you're trying to watch or keep an eye on something. So while you're twisting, it also kind of makes you twirl around. So, I can't face the TV the entire time I'm on it. For a few seconds I may be facing a wall, then a window, my computer, and then back to the TV a few seconds. Absolutely despise this.3) I'm surprised that by as much burning that I feel in my stomach, I have not woken up the next morning to aching abs, which makes me feel like I have not done enough. So, maybe this can be a pro if you have no aching muscles that prevent you from working out. But I really would have liked to have felt that I just made a difference.My stomach is currently 39 inches and I'm looking forward to seeing that go down. I hate my stomach and am trying to flatten it down. Ugh! I will keep updating you guys!UPDATE 3/14/13When doing this for 30 minutes, calories burned (according to my calorie watch) are around 151 calories. When I did the exercise today, the cramps were actually worse than they were before. So, for every song that finished, i took a small break in between songs worth 30 minutes. Honestly, I believe this disk will work, but it's a dreadful workout. You're on a disk twisting for 30 minutes.

"**INFO**I am a 27-year-old womanaround 163-157 poundsI am 5'4 and my first round on the stepper has been a success. My progress was doing 1442 steps in 32 minutes and I burned 200 calories. The workout REALLY hurts, meaning if it's your first time using one of these things, you'll feel your muscles being challenged. I know the front of my thighs were kind of firing up, but so was my upper butt cheeks. I could have sworn I felt something in my abs as well. I don't know. But you get tired easily because it's hard work, especially depending on how the resistance/tension knob is set. But I am impressed.**PROS**1) It already came assembled. The only thing I had to do was tighten the pulley under it.2) It does record your time, repetitions, and calories burned. And they are easy to see from above.3) I didn't really feel like i had to balance on anything else since the machine does not have any handles to keep balance on.4) It does not heat up, not to my knowledge. I used it for half an hour and things were still going great.5) It is very easy to store away. It is not really heavy, but heavy enough to break your toes if you're not careful. I just slid it under my futon.6) Your progress does not reset. If there is a reason you have to step off the machine to do something, it will pause. It will not reset without your permission.**CONS**Can't think of any at the moment.I will keep updates on my progress.Update2/12/14I am using this for the second time and I had a little squeaking on the other side. It probably just needs lubricating.2/23/14The stepper is still going strong. I had lubricated the squeaking sounds successfully. You can really feel it burning your upper buns.

"When you open it up, there are three sections; one for your cards, which there are two slot areas. The second section consist of a zipper section with two sides inside. To me, this is the most secure area becuase of the zipper for money and coins. The last section in the back is where your phone can be stored. However, I don't use it for that. I just put coupons and other things back there. Be aware the section is not very secure. So, if you put change back there, it will fall out from the little spaces below.I've had this wallet for about half a year and it STILL looks very good. There are no tears and wears. I got mines from EBAY for around 5 bucks, free shipping.2/14/14 UpdateI did discover that even from the middle zipper section, some coins can still slip from under and into the back area. Ugh. Anyway, It's best to get a little coin pouch you can hook it up with then to rely on coins for this wallet.2/15/14While I was in the store, my coins kept falling out onto the floor.

"I am around 163 pounds27 years old5'4 and this little thing got me tired by even just 30 seconds into the workout. I did not want to give up just yet because I really wanted to get my money's worth. I had eaten two Subway Oatmeal cookies which total 400 calories. I really wanted to burn those suckers off. But with only doing 1442 repetitions in 30 minutes, I managed to burn 205 calories (that's what the monitor read).**PROS**1) It will get the job done. I know it's cheap and looks like it's not a lot, but it got my front thighs and my upper butt cheeks on fire. I would love a full and firm butt not only for looks but your butt muscles are the biggest muscles and if those are firm, they really  help out with your metabolism (Or so Leslie Sansone said). I was really tired on the first round but I had to push myself.2) You can adjust the tension/resistance at the bottom front if you want to push yourself. I had to loosen it. it's really tough work.3) It's not heavy at all or takes up a lot of room. No, it cannot fold for lower storage.4) It does record your time, your repetitions, and calories burned.5) The machine will not reset your progress. So, if you stop working out like to go to the bathroom or answer the door, it will pause until you come back.6) It does not make a lot of noise.**CONS**1) The machine is very simple, meaning there's not a lot to it. For example, there's no place to hold your remote or water bottle.2) It does not record your heart rate.3) The manual instructions was a little confusing despite putting it together around 30 minutes. There was a picture in the instructions with all the parts creating a skeletal scene of it, and that was rather more helpful than the actual instructions.**NEUTRAL**1) The stem coming up does rock a little, but not much (It could just be the way that I set it together). Sometimes I'm afraid to even lean on it.2) I'm 5'4 as described earlier, but getting on it makes me feel like I'm too tall. The machine is not very leveled, as if it makes me feel like there was a part I missed that I did not install.Overall, I love the machine. It's not perfect, but I'm glad I'm getting something out of it. I will continue to give some updates as I go becuase I read that this thing does break apart earlier than expected. So, we'll see.2/16/14 UpdateI'm continuing on the stepper and you guys have no idea how much my upper buns are on fire. This stuff is VERY tough and I don't even have it on high resistance. It's TOUGH! I don't really feel it as much in my back leg, but rather my front thighs, but the butt area is the worst. That's what makes you want to get off.3/2/14 UpdateThe stepper is still going strong and the workout is still very tough. I managed to get past 30 minutes and into maybe 45 minutes becuase I played a video game and that really got me distracted from the workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4IKW8TUXXWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IDZHF6#wasThisHelpful","RR4IKW8TUXXWQ","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keep in mind that I promise to give numerous updates about this product as I go along**PROS**1) The product already came assembled. The only thing that was detached was the resistance/tension knob. That was no big deal at all. The Instructions manual looks like it comes in three languages, English, Spanish, and maybe French. However, there's not a lot to read though. It just shows labeling of parts of the machine, how to unlock and lock the legs, how to work the tension knob and then it goes into detail what the machine operation records.Yes, there is a battery but you need a screwdriver to get it open.2) It's easy to use/operate. The legs can fold inward for easier storage. I just slipped mines under my futon when I'm done.3) The peddler space is pretty spacey. So, if you have big feet (size 8 for me), you should fit it perfectly. I did leg workout without any shoes or socks and I didn't really feel any discomfort.4) It has a nice height. I was doing this on my futon, which my futon is about a foot in height off the floor, and I was still able to workout out comfortably by watching TV.5) If you stop working out for whatever reason, like you have to answer the phone, the machine will pause your progress such as calorie count, number of repetitions, and time. It won't reset unless you make it reset. Even if you get back to it hours later, it still has your last progress. So, it looks like it won't reset without your permission**CONS**1) The ONLY con I had so far was that I wish the bridge that holds the legs could be adjusted more. So, if you have a small table you wanted to set this on, it may not work. It is possible to have one of the legs not lock to make it narrower, but then as you're doing the arm workout, it might move and became imbalanced. With the legs spread out like you see in the picture, it is slightly over 18 1/2 inches wide. So, make sure your desk or table can handle that.**Neutral**Yes, it does overheat, it even has the warning sticker on there about it. I was using this for about 25 minutes and noticed the metal parts near the peddles were warm. But that was never a big deal to me because I used it for nearly 60 minutes and it's not like it was ready to scorch something. It was just noticeable that it was hot. Now the metal part near the black machine are the hottest parts.**My Progress**I'm 27 years old163 pounds5'4 heightSome reviews said that this was meant for people that could do minimum workout. But as I did it, I could really feel the burn in my arms, mainly in my right arm for whatever reason, but that's because I was using it in a chair while sitting on the futon. That might not have been the best thing. But it definitely got to my arms.It is a really good workout plan while watching TV for leg workout. I cozied up with the blanket over me and my legs and I just peddled all through the TV shows and did not realize I ended up burning 511 calories, basically that tasty Wendy's burger I had just a few hours ago was now burned off.**Results**25 minutes1529 repetitions218 Calories burned40 minutes2468 repetitions352 Calories burned59 minutes3581 repetitions511 calories burnedThis was all done in one night.

I just hope it lasts awhile. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I am a heavy loyal Amazon customers. So, I log in everyday to check progress.Update2/10/14I was playing a video game and burned 600 calories with 4200 spins in 70 minutes. I found out you can also reverse the peddling. It really does help time fly by. It still gets warm as you go, but it's not really hot.3/2/14For some reason, the monitor at one point stopped counting my progress. I just happened to look down and it was stuck on the same numbers even as I kept peddling. I tried resetting, but nothing worked. So, I left it alone. I pulled it out another day and it happened again. So, I figured it must have been the battery, but I haven't even used it that much for the battery to already be drained. I snapped off the monitor but couldn't really understand anything. I tried putting it back on but it's mysteriously tough to secure it back on. Now, it's just hanging. Also, every time I tighten the tension, I notice that it just resets by itself. So, it's like you can't really workout with a difficult tension setting for long.3/14/14I finally was able to snap the monitor inside again. But it took much effort and I really could have hurt myself. It pinched one of my fingers and it hurt a lot. I had to start by sticking the bottom part in first, and then leaning the rest into it. Then, I had to mash down or apply pressure. Ridiculous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L7QZY13399N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VWJYSE#wasThisHelpful","R28L7QZY13399N","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ladies, you need to be aware that sometimes sellers just can't seem to correctly advertise something. The picture is amazing! That's why I bought it in the first place. But if you're 5'4, this is just going to look like a regular sweater. It did not even go past my hips. I bought mines from Ebay from an oversees seller for around $16 and I forced the seller to give some kind of partial refund for selling me something that wasn't promising. You have to be really short for this to mimic the advertising picture.

"I was unsure about this DVD becuase I have tried dancing workouts, especially Zumba and just could not keep up or was convinced my body was getting a good workout. But given that I'm a big Leslie fan, I went ahead and experienced it. Boy did it leave a smile on my face!**TIME**There is no timer at all, but given the fact that the music and positive faces keep you occupied, I highly doubt a timer is needed. But it's consisted of 3 miles, which each mile is typically 15 minutes each. The 1 mile complete message will pop up on the bottom left corner without her even saying anything. I think she only mentioned it once. So, the three miles are really connected as one. You just keep going.**WORKOUT SETUP**This DVD is really HIGH-intensity. My mother is 50 years old, 202 poundish and was able to keep up. But it wasn't her kind of thing just yet (she's lost 12-16 pounds with Leslie workouts). She just had a problem with not wearing a sports bra, which you WILL need for this workout. But she felt she wasn't entirely ready for a workout like this. There is a lot of jumping/bounce, twists, shifts. I am around 163 pounds and this workout was fine with me. It got me catching my breath but it wasn't an impossible workout.The first part is kind of like a warm-up and then afterward, she gives you a small feel of what to expect. But after that is interval time. You'll do a steady and calm walk for 2 minutes and then for 20 seconds you go into high intensity. I can't help but get so pumped up and excited every time the high intensity part comes, becuase the people are so positive and loud. I think she does the intervals four times. Then after that, you kind of really get into the dancing, which pretty much are the same moves you've done with her before, there is just some modification.**PEOPLE**Someone mentioned that it looked like she hired professional dancers. It seems that way for SOME of them, but I don't think so. Sometimes you will see them doing their own thing, having just a little too much fun. Some will sing and maybe even be too dramatic about it. I remember sometimes being a little annoyed, but oh well. Laura from Five Really Big Miles DVD is there. I LOVED seeing her still in the game and I hope to see more of her in other DVDs. My most favorite person was Marvin (in all black with a hat). He seems like a sweet guy and I never fail to develop this warm feeling every time the camera is on him. Nick from Walk it Off in 30 days is there. He looks way different without his beard. Overall, everybody is in rainbows and unicorns. Way too happy, but VERY inspiring.**MUSIC**The music is actually very impressive. It's very moving and it makes you want to give your best. There was maybe one song that was 'bleh'. But I'd give it a 4.5/5.**MY EXPERIENCE**First try = Burned 292 caloriesSecond Try = Burned 285Third try - Burned 272 caloriesThe trick is to exaggerate arm movement!I did try this workout with wrist weights and while it's possible, your arms will get really tired, especially with all the jumping and twisting, but it really adds to the arms getting a more fair workout. I had 1.5 pounds each.I usually combine this workout with her other DVD called Walk to the hits Party Songs and just do them both at the same time.Very cool workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20V3K92OKQAQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8A0PNK#wasThisHelpful","R20V3K92OKQAQO","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had took a leap of faith to purchase a different kind of bread from the normal routine bread I and my family buy (From Wal-Mart). I'm actually not really big on bread. It's the kind of food I normally don't eat. But I have been suffering from constipation on and off throughout my life. I picked up the Nuttygrain flavor for three reasons1) To eat something healthy2) It was around a reasonable number of calories per slice3) It had 20% fiber!It's even got a grade A on my calorie counter profile after I input it into my daily calorie intake.To give you a background on my form of constipation (not that I'm trying to be gross, but hopefully, this could help someone else), I go to the bathroom for #2 at least once a day, and that's usually in the mornings or around early afternoon. I'm lucky if I can go again. It's not that I have a hard stool, it's the fact that my body does not give me strong enough signals to push. So, sometimes I have to force myself to go and while I have some success, it still does not feel effective. I am active in exercise and have been eating fruits like crazy. Barely see a change. I have used suppositories and even drunk that nasty Lemon flavored Magnesium Citrate (if you drink this, I  highly suggest you get the grape flavor).Well, all that changed when I started eating this bread for just a few days. I was visiting the bathroom twice to triple than my usual visit. I am beyond impressed and feel like I made a new friend. Even as I type this, I have the urge to go!As far as the taste; it's not the most delicious but definitely not the nastiest. It takes exactly what you'd expect it to taste by just looking at it. In other words, it's easy enough to eat. I eat one to two slices a day just to make it last. I had bought the 18-slice package.***EDIT***1/16/13I ate two slices today and all throughout the day, my bowel movements or stools came out smoothly without much effort to push. I am beyond impressed right now. Maybe I should start making a sandwich out of these slices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5RW3PQGA41C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EL1YSNO#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5RW3PQGA41C","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this around May of 2013. I used it almost every time I worked out doing high intensity aerobics, or walking on track. It has the adjustable band and the back of the watch does have that cold plate.**Some Main FEATURES**It does allow your to input- Time- Your Weight- Age- Height- Gender- Time- High, Medium, or Low sensing to track your movementDuring workout you can track your heart rate, steps, miles, and calories burned. There is a light button for if you can't see in the dark.***PROS***1) The heart rate is accurate, at least in opinion. I checked it by watch and by counting my heart rate another method. Both came to similar numbers.2) The calorie may not be accurate in how much it keeps up with your movement, but it seems to count up to the same amount of calories for specific workouts. For example. I do Leslie Sansone workouts. For her 4-Mile Power work, the watch would always tell me I burn between 400 and 500 calories. I never got below 300.. For A Gilad workout I've done at least two to three times, it always came out to around 200-261. So the watch does not give you crazy numbers you have not seen before for the same workouts.***ANNOYING CONS***1) There would be times where I'm afraid to do high intensity workouts becuase there were times where the watch reset either by itself, or I'd move my arms so intensely that the 'reset' button brushes up against my wrist and resets my progress. There was one time I was doing a long workout and wanted to see my progress at the end. I was VERY disappointed to see that only 42 or so calories were burned after nearly an hour's worth of exercise. One reason it may reset without your consent is that maybe it was shaking too much/dramatically. The other reason is that when you bend your wrist against the watch, the reset button is mashed.2) If you do not turn the watch off, it will just continue running, counting calories even when you do nothing or not wearing it. If you do turn it off and then turn it back on, all of your data will be erased. You will have to input it all back in. It's such a shame this watch does not have a 'sleep' mode at least.3) I would say around the middle of December 2013, I've grown detached from the watch becuase I felt it wasn't keeping up accurately, like it was slowing down. I don't ever turn it off, though. So, maybe the battery was degrading. I don't know. But I did some exercises where I knew based on instinct I was burning more than what the watch was showing me. to me it was slowing down. Now, I don't trust it much.I say buy this watch if it's on sale. It's not worth $20. I'm currently looking to get another brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X5R69WW1VUG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WQKT1K#wasThisHelpful","R2X5R69WW1VUG4","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been playing games ever since i was about 13 years old. I'm a female video gamer and i'm almost 23 now, but i've never ran into a game like THIS. Yes i've played the other metal gears, but nothing like this!!! I dont even know where to begin.To start off with the Graphics in this game, its fantastic, its almost as if youre watching a movie. everything is perfect and neat, even movements of their mouths in coversations. everything just about looks as real as it can get.The Bosses are just like your normal Metal Gear bosses like Raven, Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Fortune, Vamp, The End, The Fear etc... Only this time you'll get a blast out of these new bosses. I must admit, the bosses were challenging. like for example, when i fought Laughing Octopus, i was having a hard time finding her, but i was also like ""crap, this is a good boss fight!!"" and when i fought Crying Wolf I spend most of most of my time hiding under the truck becuase i was getting a bit freaked out, but it was fun as heck!!!!!!!!!!The cutscenes are a bit longer then the past metal gears, there's ALOT of explaining and you have to pay attention and try not to doze off. I did not understand everything they said, but there were times where i wish they had'nt exaggerated some points in the game. but the majority of the cutscenes were actually pretty goodMetal gear fans get to do ALOT more in this game then you could in other Metal Gears. one of the first events i enjoyed doing was trying to find Naomi's footprints, then afterwards being chased by the GECKOs while Snake had protect the tank from being attacked, i loved being on the bike with old Eva and seeing slow-motion scenes. and *******Spoilers, i enjoyed that they brought Snake back to shadow moses. It brought back memories, i enjoyed that mission more than anything in this MG4 plus getting to ride the very thing that tried to Kill snake, the Rex. *********Thats another thing thats awesome about this game, you'll have reappearing characters. bascially MG4 will answer all the remaining questions you have.In this Metal Gear you can buy weapons, or more like buy the license for it. when you pick up stuff or depending how youre doing in battle, you get points for it. so yea, now you have a little shopThe ending is the richest I've ever seen. I've never seen a game that had an ending that was almost an hour long.*~Bad Parts about the game *~The only bad parts about the game is that1)they did mix up the controls a bit, but its pretty tolerant. I was still use to ""O"" being the confirm button but they changed it to ""X""2)Everytime youre in a different chapter the game has to install everytime, no matter how many times you've played the game3) Snake reloads TOOO slow.I didnt like the new Codec actually. I do give points up for the amazing movements of the characters on the screen, but i actually prefer the old fashion codec.If you've been a metal gear fan for a long time, Please i suggest you buy the last part of the story. i loved it ALOT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTQDDVVITSIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FQ2D5E#wasThisHelpful","R2GTQDDVVITSIW","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasnt sure if I should buy this product since nobody had given a review, but i went ahead and bought it because i've been wanting a bible on DVD for a long time. So I decided not to put it off any longer.The bible is divided by the books and then by chapters. For example, Genesis chapter 1, 2, etc. You can easily pick up where you left off.I laid in my bed one night, and just listened to the narrator. He is a very good speaker and is very GOOD at pronouncing some of the difficult names people had back then. The screen shows an open big book with the text there. The background behind it is just of some kind of land with a lot of trees.  There are no sound effects but just the sound of his voice going through the story with us.its worth buying. But keep in mind that you may need to keep hold of that remote because since the bible is hard to understand at times, you may need to pause or slow down. I did rewind a bit.**Update** 7/17/13It's unfortunate how this DVD seems to lack a lot of commands. For example, I can't pause. I'd press the pause button over and over and a bit red circle with a slanted line in the middle pops up. How can a DVD not let you pause? It's the same with fast forwarding. Playing it from a PS3 seems to work a lot better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20EQYYKKF4J0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EAWMJM#wasThisHelpful","R20EQYYKKF4J0S","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**bad things about it**There was nothing wrong with the story, actually it was just a continuation of Legend, so there was NOTHING wrong with THAT part, however i believe they really screwed it up this time. I mean Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness was much better then this.Camera angles. everyone has already said it before, its too awkward.Numerous glitches. you die, you came to life, your bike is somewhere else, far away instead of being by your side. you get stuck in places that don't make sense. there was one time i moved a rock, all of the sudden the camera got stuck behind it and then my screen turned black, i had to kill her to start over from the save point. There are no boss battles, you have LITTLE enemy encounters, meaning, you battle the SAME kind of creatures throughout the game.There are TOO many secrets that she finds, there like 50 secrets in one level and 20 in others. its like she finds them in OBVIOUS places but then 20 steps later, she finds another. whats the point in having them if they are too obvious? plus the secrets only unlocks pictures, no cinematics, no outfits, just pictures.you cannot replay levels.you don't get to really keep all your weapons, you are given a choice to pick ONE before the level starts and it runs out of ammo.SPOILERSat the end i was pretty disappointed, i mean I felt that Lara never got a real closure. once her mother appeared in the form of a Thrall, Lara just shot her off the ledge and THAT WAS IT. that was the end of the moment that we've all waited for. I dont think it even lasted a minute.another thing, the ending didnt make sense.

"When I first saw the teasing trailer, i was about to fall to the floor and die. I wanted the game so bad, and it was all i thought about while i was in School. I even visited their website on a number of occasions. well, my dramatic acts were all for nothing. Its like waiting for santa to come down the chimney to give you a toy, but instead gives you a pile of crap.The reason i gave it a low rating, was because this game did NOT CONCENTRATE on Yuna's mission. It barely explained anything. Yuna was ALWAYS distracted, someone was always in trouble, someone always needed her to do something, she was always in some kind of tournament or running errands. I mean this game should have been called ""Final Fantasy X-2: Sidequest"", becuase 80% of the game was just sidequests, had NOTHING to do with the storyline.Yuna goes through a HUGE transformaton. she goes from this goodie two shoe I-must-follow-the-teachings-of-Yeavon down to earth Summoner, to this pop-singing, skin-revealing Sphere Hunter, she hopes to find these spheres that would explain why her beloved Tidus disappears or maybe hopes to find him again. She's more energetic, she's still loved by the people, you may encounter a few who believer her fame days are over and wont even bother giving her the special treatment.The reason i say her missions barely have anything to do with the story is becuase she finds all these spheres and almost everyone of them is a disappointment accept one she found in Kilika of Shuyin. THAT sphere was a pretty good one, why couldnt they find more spehere like that one?I wanted to know more about Shuyin, I wanted to Know more about Lenne and WHY they had such a strong connection to Yuna and Tidus, besides the dressphere she wore. They should have gave Yuna another dream where she woke up as Lenne and had the story shift into THEIR time and see how their lives were portrayed. I really wanted to know just STUFF about them, how did they meet! how did Lenne do in battle?They do introduce some new characters such as Paine, LeBlanc, Logos, Ormi, Barilai, Nooj and Gippal. It would be nice if they made a seperate game for Baralei, Nooj and Gippal.YOu can revist some places from the first Series and even speak to the same characters. the music wasnt really all that great, the moonflow song made me want to go crazy.I have to admit, i did enjoy the battle system, the girls have a handful of dressphers to choose from, so i enjoyed all the different kinds of magic and transformations.Yuna can play blitzball, but you can't control her, or anyone for that matterthere are 4 endings depending on what you do during the game.The game was bascially just a charlie's angel type. three girls on random missions. *sigh*","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OU11W6XCHPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008URUA#wasThisHelpful","R5OU11W6XCHPG","AGAOZ53UU82G7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAOZ53UU82G7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hadn't bought a new bathing suit in years and decided I needed to. Ordering this type of thing online is always tricky but Amazon is pretty good about returns so I went for it.I read the other reviews and decided to order a size up to help combat the shorts-riding-up problem, but unfortunately it's still an issue. The top fits well when dry but it starts to float up a little bit at the bottom when swimming. I've labeled this as fitting ""somewhat small"" due to the shorts, but the top is as expected. For those who have said the top doesn't have enough room in the chest, I'd like to point out that the little tie in the front under the bust is actually adjustable and not just decoration, in case you didn't know.So, I can exchange this for my usual size and get a better fitting top and have shorts that ride up even worse, or I can keep this size and deal with the top being a bit loose and floaty in the water, or I could keep this suit AND buy a smaller one and mix the tops and bottoms, but a big reason I went with this suit in the first place was the price, so I've decided to just keep it. If this bathing suit had drawstrings in the sides like many do this problem would be an easy fix!All in all, it fits okay. It's not uncomfortably tight or so loose it's a tent that you can't keep down. It's also simple but cute and under $50 so it's worth trying out.

"I almost want to give this tent 4 stars but I just can't. Let's start with the pros and cons:Pros:Easy to set up. As others reviewers stated, getting the ends of the poles in the pockets was a little tricky but it wasn't half as difficult as other people made it sound. 2 adults (and by ""adult"" I mean an 18 year old girl and a 20 year old girl) had it up in about 10 minutes.It's pretty roomy for a 3 man. I'm only about 5'4 but my friend who set it up with me is around 6"". There was more than enough room for her to lay anywhere in the tent, but since the middle goes further out, that would probably be the best place for a taller person to lay. We were going to have another person tent with us but stuff came up. Anyway, the third person is around 5'7 and I have no doubt she would have comfortably fit in with us.Cons:It leaks quite a bit in 2 places, but I think seam sealer will take care of it.Even with nobody sleeping in it for 6 days (we left it up in my backyard for a bit to see how it handled some pretty strong rain) it got a small hole in the inside floor. It's so small that a tiny duct tape patch will be more than enough to fix it, but I think the fact it wasn't being used and was on soft ground and it still got a tear is a bit ridiculous. I'm worried about ripping it now. On the bright sid, these tents have pretty long warranties (10 years), but I'm not 100% sure what it covers.The ventilation is so-so.I'm not outright disappointed in this tent but I have a friend who's equally priced and sized tent of another brand survived being left up from summer all the way through a snowy New England winter, then was ready to use as if nothing ever happened by the following summer. That tells me that even for the cheap price, this tent could be better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCGEDKLYHGHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PAT60S#wasThisHelpful","R1CCGEDKLYHGHG","A3BMI7VGJT60Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMI7VGJT60Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been using this type of cat litter for the last month or so and lemme tell you, it blows. It’s supposed to be “natural” but still clumping/scoopable (or in my case, roll-able with the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box) but IT LIES. All it does is make the entire room smell like pee and oranges (cats hate citrus so wtf?), no matter how often I clean it it smells like piss and fruit, and possibly most importantly: it doesn't clump very well at all. It crumbles apart and you can clean the box all you want but there'll still be dirty chunks and grains of used litter you just don't get out -- ESPECIALLY if you're not manually scooping the clumps.This litter currently has like 77 one star reviews, 14 two star reviews, and 10 three star reviews on Amazon out of 170 reviews total which means it it has 101/170 bad to ‘meh’ reviews so clearly I’m not makin’ this up. It's awful. My cat doesn't see to like it either. I'm switching ASAP.For the record, Precious Cat clumping litter is the best I’ve used to dateYou will never know when your cat goes to the bathroom with that litter because you will never smell it and when you scoop the clumps, it actually stays together and leaves the rest of the litter clean. Her litterbox is currently located in my room (I got a new, bigger box recently that doesn't fit where the old one did and I'm yet to find a better place for it) and I still never know when she does her business with that litter. With this litter, it's impossible to not know.

"For a while I wasn't feeding my cat the best food. I'd been wanting to switch her to something healthier for some time but I couldn't decide what type to go with, and while I want the best for my cat, I didn't want to shell out a good chunk of money on super expensive cat food only for her to end up not liking it or getting sick from it, y'know?I took into consideration grain free cat foods and 100% wet cat food diets, but decided that even a higher quality dry food would be better than what I was already giving her (Purina Kitten Kaboodle. Awful, I know!) That helped me narrow it down a little but I was still faced with a never ending list of brands and formulations to pick from. Purina One? Purina Pro Plan? Natural Balance? Wellness CORE? Taste of the Wild? Blue Buffalo? I settled on Pro Plan after talking with the person who runs the company's Twitter -- they were quite the salesman. Even if they hadn't reached out to me when I tweeted about my adventures in choosing a cat food, Pro Plan seemed like a good middle range option - it's significantly better than what I had already been feeding her, but not ungodly expensive. It also doesn't have as many bad reviews or claims of cats getting rashes, illness, etc from this food as other, pricier cat foods do. The only complaints I saw were from longtime customers whose cats noticed a change in the formula and would no longer eat it, but since my cat had never had Pro Plan before that didn't really matter.Even though I gradually switched her food by mixing it with her old kind, she was very picky at first and tried to eat around the Pro Plan. She eventually learned to like it and has been eating Pro Plan for about a month now. In that time, I've noticed that her fur is significantly shinier and softer, but hat's about the only difference I've seen, but it's better than seeing no difference at all. It hasn't made her sick and it's definitely better for her than her old food without being super pricey, so I'll probably be sticking with this for a while!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8Y0TX2QAPBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VIY9E8#wasThisHelpful","R3T8Y0TX2QAPBY","A3BMI7VGJT60Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMI7VGJT60Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot. She's currently out of work (recently had a baby) and hadn't dyed her hair in months (pregnant), so we decided it would be fun to do. She chose this color because it's a bit deeper than she normally does, and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she doesn't have to work. Our plan was to use this and use something like Manic Panic over some pieces to make them even more red (which we've done before with her usual reds, and it always works out well), but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it's in the light. It's like purple-red black. It's lightened up after a wash or two, but still much darker than she anticipated. We didn't even bother with step 2, adding Manic Panic over sections, because we know it's so dark it won't make much of, if any, difference. It's a nice color, but not anything like it looks on the box. She's very fair (like me, which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes I've used personally), so it's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.That said, the dye itself works well, processes quickly, and wasn't overly damaging to her hair. The shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also (she has very long, thick, curly hair). The dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected, but it then turned purple-ish as it processed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXLDIIROFCRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8EOYM6#wasThisHelpful","R3VXLDIIROFCRM","A3BMI7VGJT60Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMI7VGJT60Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about (fortunately!). I'm not saying that they're wrong or lying, just that I've never experienced what they have. Maybe they've gotten bad batches or I've just gotten lucky? I've purchased this watercolor set on two different occasions, the most recent purchase being last week. I saw that it was only about $12 on Amazon as opposed to $25-$30 elsewhere (which still isn't a bad price), and I wanted to see if they were somehow worse than the previous set I bought from Blick, since the reviews are erratic.The paint arrived in good condition, though the box had clearly been opened and taped back up. One of the tubes had some leakage -- not of the pigment, just of the carrier(?) fluid, the actual paint base. The paint inside looked perfectly fine and unaffected. It wasn't a big mess, all I had to do was rinse the tube under warm water.Other than that, the set is just as nice as the last time I bought it. The brush that comes with it is decent, the palette is just cheap thin plastic and you'll want to get something better, and the paints are, in my opinion, are impressively pigmented and smooth considering their type (student) and price range. Yes, they are the ""academy"" line, so they're not the same as you would get from Grumbacher's Artist line, or as perfect as Sennelier or Holbein, Old Holland, etc, but they're better than a lot of other student grade paints. I would recommend these if you're interested in trying watercolor or if you want a budget paint set that's better than a lot of others in the similar price ranges.A little goes a long way and they fairly easily re-wettable, as well as consistent in pigmentation and color saturation. The only issue is the tubes can be a little too pressurized at times, and sometimes I have slight issues with the pigment and the actual clear-ish paint base separating. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to affect the quality, it's just annoying when semi-clear fluid comes out without pigment at first, but it all mixes back up fine if you squish the tube or just blend it back together in the palette. It's a small drawback, but other than that I've never had any problems. Definitely no color mixing issues or gritty textures like other reviewers describe!Maybe Amazon has a bad bunch, because if you look on Dick Blick's site, 100% of reviewers (12 currently) would recommend this product to a friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L798KB2OMKBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OVCQ7Y#wasThisHelpful","R3L798KB2OMKBF","A3BMI7VGJT60Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMI7VGJT60Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So my goal for the new year was to limit (and eventually entirely eliminate) animal products from my life, but then I was suddenly struck with the realization I might be gluten intolerant (it runs in the fam' and I've had persistent seemingly unexplainable and randomly occurring body ailments for over a year now so I figured I might as well try avoiding it and see what happens!)I knew I definitely wouldn't be able to work on cutting out meat, dairy, AND gluten if I couldn't find some tasty snackage in the process. Lucky for me, these definitely fit my requirements! While they are  a bit pricy in comparison to something like a pack of Oreos, it's worth it if you can't or don't want to be consuming gluten or animal products!They're hard cookies which I don't mind. The chocolate chip is probably my favorite because, obviously, the chocolate adds more sweetness and makes it taste more like a regular ol' chocolate chip cookie. The others aren't bad either but they are a little bit bland in comparison, but they definitely aren't gross or inedible. They're still sweet and yummy as a cookie should be.

"I prefer Punky Colour or Special Effects over Manic Panic but they don't always have the colors I need in stock or on Prime and I have to settle for MP. The color is pretty but I find that all Manic Panic shades fade and bleed much worse than the other brands I named, and they don't tend to fade out lighter/pastel versions of the original color, but to dulled, muted tones.

"My previous palette ran away and I needed to get a replacement ASAP. This is serving its intended purpose at an affordable price. It's a nice size and has a good amount of different types of wells. My only complaint is that I wish it had more of the smaller circular wells for pure straight-from-the-tube colors, though 8 is quite a few. In all reality, you can paint with just the 3 primaries so I shouldn't be complaining. I use about 9 colors on average so I only have to do without or find an odd space for one color which isn't too bad.The palette is made of a sturdy plastic and the 8 larger square wells are nice and roomy for mixing color. I like that they are separated instead of there just being one big white space. I am a (somewhat) clean and precise mixer, so the more wells and dividers a palettes has, the better. I haven't really used the 4 larger round ones for much yet, but I assume they'll be good for creating large amounts of needed colors or for very watery colors for washes.If you need a cheap but relatively large palette, this is a nice option. Don't worry about its lack of lid. You can use a large Ziplock bag (like the gallon sized ones) or even the clear bag it comes in if you can remove it carefully enough. If all else fails, plain old kitchen wrap will work. Don't fork over a ton of extra money for a locking lid you don't really need (unless you plan on traveling with it a ton, but even then...)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23QBODHAS04YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GXBXHG#wasThisHelpful","R23QBODHAS04YY","A3BMI7VGJT60Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMI7VGJT60Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, Moleskines. How much hype you have. I've only been using Moleksines for the last few years so I can't really tell you for certain about the changes in construction and quality, but I can say that the current books are solid and nice, but I'm not entirely sure if they are worth the attention they receive or their often over-steeped price. There's nothing wrong with them, the paper is quite thick and lovely, the yellow tinted paper is pleasant to work against, and the construction is solid, but the fact of the matter is that I can find sketchbooks just as good if not better for the same or lesser price. I do like these sketchbooks and I may continue to pick them up on occasion (the watercolor Moleskines and the tiny pocket ones have more uses for me), but I am not as in love with these as everyone else is. However, I am still giving it a good rating because there is nothing wrong with the book, there just isn't much all that exceptional about it.I wouldn't try to deter anyone from checking these out, but know that it's not some magical hidden jewel of a sketchbook. You might end up preferring these and that's fine, but I don't think that's because it's special, just purely your preference. Maybe they were something incredible or above average in their prime, but they aren't all that amazing now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXS44Z69OEDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8883701151#wasThisHelpful","RHXS44Z69OEDE","A3BMI7VGJT60Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMI7VGJT60Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The billfold is divided into two sections . This part of the wallet is about two inched longer and just as tall as American paper money. The credit card slots will hold multiple cards and are also wide enough for RFID envelopes. There is a flip-up cardholder with an RFID shield sewn in. The wallet looks well made. The outer edges are folded over, are single stitched,  and look like they have small tooling marks. The corners appeared to be tacked.  The billfold interior and the insides of the card pockets are a papery vinyl of some type that stays in place when the wallet is loaded and twisted. The hinge is big enough so that the billfold can easily hold 50 or 60 bills.

"Tomameri was kind enough to send me a sample MP4 player for review. This is a good compact MP4 player. This latest new form factor design eliminates the on off switch from the end and moves the sd card slot to the side. That means the device is about a half inch smaller and still has the same size video screen about the size of two postage stamps. The metal case is sturdy. On the front here is an on off button surrounded by a 4 position toggle ring and two other press button controls above. Once the device is switched on and the operating system loads  there is a choice of a set up and 8 different operations: music, e-reader, games, video, voice, recording, photo, and radio. The default is music.  An animated menu displays each of these choices one at a time. Once one of the functions is selected  you can access a text menu or default to the previous operation. Uploading to the device is simple and the file system is straightforward and can be customized. The player reproduces music without pauses or dropouts. The video plays smoothly.  The music player allows you to skip on to the next song with a press of a button. The menus are easy to operate and most of the content should be accessible with  5 clicks of less.  8 gigs of memory is plenty for over 1000 tunes and still have room to spare. A micro SD card will give you all the versatility you need content-wise. The battery is still long lasting and the player will operate about a whole day. It takes a couple hours to fully charge.This is a good choice for anyone looking for a small, easy to use MP4 player","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4YD7IACA8S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016K5IY2E#wasThisHelpful","R3C4YD7IACA8S2","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steep Wellness was kind enough to send me a sample package of tea for evaluation.  The tea is a complex mix of flavors that is very drinkable. It has a sweetness to it that tastes like anise, some lemony flavor, and a spiciness that might be eucalyptus.  I have been brewing the tea by covering the bottom of my french press with the mixture and filling it a little over half full. The tea has a reddish brown color when brewed. I haven't tried to reuse the mixture. After a few days of a cup in the mornings my sinuses suddenly cleared. It was a little scary to be able to fill my lungs up so easily. I didn't even know my sinuses were plugged up. I wouldn't expect the tea to have caused this. Maybe it was a change in the weather or a fluke. I haven't changed my diet or routine, except for a cup of morning tea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWEL6ZAUDWTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S3S63W#wasThisHelpful","R3PWEL6ZAUDWTQ","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QooWare was kind enough to send me a sample light for evaluation. This small bright dome light comes with a 5 foot cord. There is an on off switch in the middle of the cord.

There is also an adhesive pad  in the box in case you want to mount the light permanently.  I think the light is more useful to take with you while traveling or to use outdoors where you might have a laptop but no AC.  The dome puts out light comparable to at least a 25 watt bulb.  Although dome is frosted the the light is blinding. I wrap a napkin around it as a shade. Electrical tape would probably work as well. The led doesn't heat the light's plastic lens.

"Senty was kind enough to send me a sample headphone for examination. These headphones cone with an attached 8 foot cord that is fairly thick and has a usb connection.  The ear cushions are held against your ears by two bendable plastic rods and held in place on top of your head  an elastic band that stretches out from the tops of the earpieces. This is actually more comfortable because there is less actual weight resting on your head. The earpieces are large enough to fit over my whole ear. These are one of the more comfortable headphones I have worn. They have a volume control and and also a switch that  lights up a blue led behind the normally dark outer ear cushion covers.  The sound is warm and blended. There is a good amount of bass response. Instead of isolating the different sounds they all combined and blended together. There is a little bit of imaging on recordings where the engineers boosted distinct sounds into the left  or right channels. That is rare. The headphones have very little high end response. High hats are clear and at normal volumes but the resonant tones are absent. It's nice not having the voices and cymbals hissing and shrieking.

"Syrinx was kind enough to send me a sample device holder for evaluation. This handlebar clamp holds devices more firmly with less movement while riding than other clamps I have tried. It is all plastic except for the hinge pin, the very thin locking screw and two rubber inserts that fit on the handlebar clamp. The handlebar clamp will not fit around handlebars will both rubber pieces in place. You will only be able to use one. I got rid of both of them and was able to fit the clamp around my cork handlebar tape.  The clamp is big so it will work best with wide handlebars.  I think what makes it so stable is the swivel is located right next to the handlebar clamp. The device clamp is spring loaded and opens with a push of a button. There are rails with rows of closely spaced teeth that hold the side clamps. The side clamps are large  and probably two or three times as thick as a phone. the clamps can be squeezed tightly  and hold the phone as tight as you want. There are also two pegs on the bottom that swing out for added support.  The clamps will probably not open wide enough to hold a phone horizontally.  The phone clamp  connect to the base  by locking 4 hooked posts into slots on a round plate. The slots are at an angle to make the clamp less likely to come loose.  Once the clamp is locked in place  it is a firm fit and won't shake loose. I had to jump three curbs before I could make the phone swivel on it's own. If you have wide handlebars and are ok with your phone positioned vertically this clamp is one to definitely consider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DG46AZ6B5JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZNU6LU#wasThisHelpful","R24DG46AZ6B5JA","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Aukey was kind enough to send me a sample of this wireless headphone for evaluation. This is a large lightweight headphone. The earpieces are bigger than my thumb and almost twice as thick from the outside of the earpiece to the tip of the ear cushion.  The  ear loops  are hard plastic and not bendable. The comfort and fit are  going to depend on the shape of your head. The wire loop between the headphones is tight enough to hold the earpieces against your head but the distance between the earloop and the sound tube is fixed. These headphones  didn't rest on the top of my ears. I could only wear them with their weight resting on my ear canals or outside my ears.  The good thing was the earpieces were curved enough so that there is enough room for sunglass frames.  These earphones last a very long time. They lasted at least a day and a half on a single charge.  Maybe the extra large size allows for a bigger than normal battery.

"Brainwavz was kind enough to send me a sample S3 headphone for evaluation. These lightweight earbuds have aluminum earpieces with comfortable cushions attached to a 5 ft. long ribbon cord. Sometimes I like the shorter length and sometimes I wish the cord was a full 6 feet. The cord does not make a very good antenna in case you live in a poor reception area and you have a device that uses the headphone cord that way. The earbuds are very comfortable. The earpieces are big  but they don't cause my ears to ache.  I can't hear people talking two feet away when I am wearing them. My first impression of the earbuds are they are very fast. The sound is clear, accurate and detailed. Each instrument is distinct and does not interfere with the other instruments on the recording. The earbuds are sometimes hard to listen to because they reveal all the buzzes  and echoes and scratches that never make it through to my speakers. With proper positioning it is possible to hear many of the bass harmonics in the lower octaves and  the midbass is very clear.  I kept switching from source to source and to me it sounds like there's a bump in about the 2k range. Most sound has an eq boost in the upper midrange these days and maybe these earbuds are just reproducing that. Still for the most part the highs just sound like hiss to me. I think the earbuds would sound better with a little high end attenuation.  The earbuds come with a large carrycase which has room for sd cards or maybe a credit card. A tie clip and a generous handful of extra ear bud cushions are also included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6KRAUZ0BE1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162C1P9O#wasThisHelpful","R3V6KRAUZ0BE1D","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The tops of the bars are wavy as if the chocolate was hand poured and left to harden, but the wavy could just as esily be made with a top of a mold.

"The Bibigo Gochujang Sauce is thinner than a paste and browner that other gochujang. It looks in color and has the consistency of a barbecue sauce. When first opening the bottle and using it as a spread the sauce tasted smoky and the peppers tasted slightly sour more than they did hot. Once the sauce was refrigerated and poured over rice the hot spiciness of the sauce was revealed. A little of the sauce goes a long way but  the sauce is thick and it is difficult to use sparingly.

"These laundry pods come packed inside small plastic tubs with widemouth tops. There are 12 pods to a tub. The tops pry off rather than screw off and have an incomprehensible tab system that allows the top to turn and not fasten tight. I can smell the bleach from several feet away.  There are 48 pods in all so you will want to make sure you can use that many before the pods start to deteriorate.  Clorox has come up with a good compromise measured amount of bleach suitable for most washes.  Since these are pods they are really not practical for other uses besides laundry and bleach in a separate powdered or liquid form is still available to augment the pods or for other non laundry uses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MOKOCQNDQ4HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EVP32S#wasThisHelpful","R3MOKOCQNDQ4HD","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brainwavz was kind enough to provide me with a sample pair of headphones for evaluation. These small lightweight headphones  may provide the most accurate sound quality ounce for ounce on the market.  The headphones  are barley 6 inches tall and the earpiece foam is only 2 1/2 inches in diameter but a lot of sound quality in packed in this small package. I didn't have any trouble wearing them on my 71/2 inch hat size head. They were not fatiguing to wear and the ear pieces  were not irritating. Most of the pads on larger size headphones aren't big enough to cover the whole ear anyway. What is most impressive about these phones is the soundstage is huge and as deep as it is wide.  I don't mind the lower bass roll off. It is better than low end muddiness and distortion. The headphones were plenty loud for me. I turned them down from full volume.  The detail and the isolation of the sounds is truly impressive. The reproduction is truly realistic.  The timbres are natural. The dynamics of the headphones reproduce the room acoustics along with the different voices and instruments.  The bluetooth coverage is good  and does not drop out where other devices drop out. There is a voice prompt for connecting the bluetooth and not tones. The voice doesn't lower with the volume level so there will be a woman screaming at you about a low battery after about 5 hours of play.  These headphones are a good tool to really help kids appreciate good sound and music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRLTSUAUXPB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CLDU4U#wasThisHelpful","R3RRLTSUAUXPB0","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coolife was kind enough to send me a sample  corkscrew for evaluation.  This  fairly large corkscrew comes in a well crafted cardboard box  with the corkscrew device fitting perfectly inside. The burnished brass is shiny without being bright. The corkscrew is foolproof. The handles align the screw in the middle of the bottle's neck and the lever guides the screw straight down.  It doesn't take much effort at all to drive the screw down into the center of the cork and the cork pops out just as easily. The separate foil cutter actually works  and is a lot easier to use than cutters built into the corkscrew.  The all-metal heavy duty construction  means no weak plastic parts to break, so the corkscrew should last a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZMZE8DA00Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SCLOLE#wasThisHelpful","R3HZMZE8DA00Z9","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EliteBaby was kind enough to send me a sample packet of safety straps for evaluation. These straps do the job. They are difficult to open, even for adults.  The sliding  latch  is very difficult to move. Once the latch is slid open  the  tongue doesn't slide out freely and must be bent and curled over a series of ridges to free it. The locking straps most likely will take two hands and several seconds to open.  Trimming the tongue will make them look nice but they are easier to manipulate and bend if the strap is longer. The neon green latch color stands out. The glue pads are about two inches long. There isn't two inches of space between my kitchen cabinets  so I wasn't able to use them there.  I wasn't able to slip the pad  underneath the edge on the adjacent cabinet. These locking straps  will not hold  cabinets closed  if the cabinets have bad or misaligned hinges and are partially open.

"This is a smooth white cream with a light  mostly citrus fragrance that applies  easily and is quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving a shine.

"The Kicking Mule was kind enough to send me a sample mug for evaluation.

The cup itself is very lightweight and easy to handle. The copper does it's job and does keep warm beverages warm and cold beverages cool. Even an hour later the cup walls still feel icy after pouring refrigerated water into it. The cup is not double walled so the cup and handle are going to feel cold when the cup contains ice beverages.

I must have larger than normal knees because the  wider end portion of the pad is still on the front of my knee and not on the sides. There is still plenty of velcro left over so they should fit knees twice as big as mine. The plastic buckles on each side that the velcro fits through are surrounded by plenty of padding and do not cut into my leg.

"Victec was kind enough to send me a sample wireless speaker for evaluation.  This speaker comes packaged in a nice clear plastic box.  The hard plastic speaker housing is about 1/3 taller than other portable speakers I have with the same size driver. Add to that  the extra height  from the suction cup at the bottom and this is a big total package.  The housing is bigger but it weighs about the same as other small potable speakers.  The driver fires downwards towards the plastic suction cup so it's not reflecting off of a very acoustically friendly surface. Placing the speaker on a hard surface does give the sound some depth compared to propping it up on its side, but the sound quality is only average.  It doesn't play all that loud.  The volume control has 32 positions. in a quiet room I can hear a buzz with the volume all the way down. The speaker doesn't clip at full volume but may be hard to hear over a running shower. Even though the speaker doesn't weigh much the only surface I could find that the suction cup would support it's weight was a mirror. I couldn't get the suction to hold on porcelain or tile or a window. Plastic is too porous. I couldn't find a metal surface where it would hold.  It's probably best to stick the speaker somewhere and leave it, except you are going to have to recharge it periodically. It will play at least 30 hours on a single charge. It took some repositioning to make a good connection and get the charging light to come on.  It's not easy to carry around without hitting the function buttons by accident. The bluetooth connection is pretty foolproof. The speaker automatically goes into pairing mode when turned on. I might have gotten a bad speaker. The device paired fine but the speaker won't play a complete set of tones in test mode. There's no rattling inside but it was sent in only a bubble wrap envelope. There seems to be something wrong  with the caching because there's drop outs every few seconds in stereo mode. This could also be caused by interference from one or more of my other bluetooth devices. I'm thinking my bluetooth mouse may be interfering a bit. The bluetooth range is good and it connects better than some devices at a distance and  where some devices lose signal.  The sound streams with almost no dropouts in mono. I actually was interested in this speaker because of the temperature display. I can not choose between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The temperature displays first in Celsius and after a period of several minutes it switches to a Fahrenheit display for what seems like a shorter period of time. It was about time I learned the Celsius scale. This is a good speaker for sticking on your bathroom or bedroom mirror and shaving, putting on makeup, or brushing your teeth while listening to morning radio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWJ57N1ZAH0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01232NPA4#wasThisHelpful","R2XWJ57N1ZAH0Z","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tomameri was kind enough to send me a sample MP4 player for evaluation. This is the smallest music player of this type that I have tried.

The removable storage is a nice feature for music sharing and downloading.  The screen is brighter than  other similar players. The device has 2 extra control buttons on the front. The bottom two silver circles are just decoration.  The on off switch is the middle button on the front instead of a switch on the bottom or the top. Most of the complaints people have about these types of players is the menus. They've gone to an animated menu that you can click through to get to the different functions like radio, music, recording, video, etc. Then you can click to a text menu if necessary.

This is a simple mouse. It is well made  although that might not be so apparent because it's feather light. The light weight makes it easy to move. the scroll wheel is ratcheted  and barely protrudes over the left and right buttons so it is easy to reach.  The wheel acts as a mid click button too.

"Hallomall was kind enough to send me a sample solar panel light for evaluation. This  is a small lightweight light whose outer housing  is only about 6 inches long. It is made to fit vertically on the wall. The solar panel is slanted slightly upwards and the led light panel  is slanted downward.  when lit, the light spreads outwards and slightly downward. The light will shine dimly once it is dark. The motion sensor activates the very bright  high light setting from about 10 feet straight on and  closer from the side. The high light setting lasts about 5 seconds before dimming and if there is continued movement the  light will switch back  for another 5 seconds of brightness after a few seconds. The light will last the whole night  at the dim setting. There is an on/off switch  inside the housing that can be reached through a pinhole by the motion sensor with a paperclip. The hole in the housing  has a plastic tube to help guide the paperclip straight down so there is less fishing around for the on/off switch than there is with other lights like this.  The dim light setting does not produce any usable light.

It is well made with the seems sewn internally on  3 sides. The pad is thicker and not at tall  as it appears in the picture.  This product seems to bemore of  a hot and cold therapy pad than a sleep mask. There is no strap to hold it in place, although the granular filling does flow easily into the eyesockets  The silky cover is not irritating and the weight of the pad does not put pressure on my eyes.  When the pad is taken out of the freezer or a microwave it will stay hoy or cold for about 10 minutes.  The pad is useful for other samll areas of the body as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J6WKDVGM9PS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X04M31C#wasThisHelpful","R3J6WKDVGM9PS7","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stronker was kind enough to send me a sample power strip for evaluation. This is a small lightweight extension device.  It has a heavy duty ac cord  with a 3-prong plug and  a velcro strap to keep the cord coiled. The strip  on/off switch on top has an indicator light. I've had problems with Chinese made extension  cord that have mis-sized sockets but plugs fit well and easy into this power box. This is really a usb  power strip with a few additional ac outlets. The AC outlets are spaced too close together. Any cord with a transformer or has a new narrow shape is going to block access to the nearby outlet.  Even conventional AC plugs  might not fit next to each other without shaving the sides a bit.

"LiteXim was kind enough to send me a sample dek lamp for evaluation. This is a great little versatile lightweight lamp. it comes with a  5 foot detachable power cord. The poser cord ends in a usb plug and  an adapter is supplied to convert  the plug to a standard AC plug. You can probable use this adapter to  charge or run other devices but I haven't tried. The light actually runs on a batter in the base. There isn't a charging indicator so I don't know how long it takes to charge her battery.  The light will operate about 3 hours at medium setting without being plugged in.  the power switch is a touch switch on the base. It operates easily for me. I often have trouble getting switched like this to recognize my touch. This light activates every time with just a light touch. There are 27 small dots in the head behind the lens as a light source. The neck of the lamp is very flexible and starts to bend about a fist length above the base. It looks like if would turn 360 degrees.  the neck can bend so that the head will lie flat. Although the base is lightweight the light always stays upright no matter how the neck is bent.  I did get a little flickering with the light set to low using the usb connector on my desktop. I don;t know if it was due to the way  the battery in the lamp regulated it's power or my desktop's power supply. The fix is easy to either  turn the light higher or  unplug it from the computer and just use the battery power. I like this lamp so much that I am using it  as a portable light to take with me from room to room. It works better than a flashlight of any of the other portable lights I have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0A9UJOLYHKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R3X692#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0A9UJOLYHKR","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This fairly large ride-on toy is safe for toddlers. The wheels do roll free but your child isn't going to get very far with only short little legs as propulsion. You may end up pushing the child around more than the toy being self propelled. When the rear wheels are placed together the bike  will stay upright on its own. Still it will teach a child how to balance. While a child is sitting on the bike there is a play radio to tune, and a key to turn, and a horn and turn signals to operate. If those are too complicated for an infant there is still a rattle to spin to keep a small one occupied. The sound effects don't always make sense. Pressing the buttons and the recorded voice will say circle, square and triangle  when there are no such shapes. The sound effects make more sense. Ir's easy to get the same sounds to repeat over and over. Hopefully one of them will catch your child's fancy. The recordings play back at two different sound levels. A child should find the toy a fun place to sit even when not moving around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1XNA473HQ8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZU90O#wasThisHelpful","R3R1XNA473HQ8M","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VicTsing was kind enough to send me a sample mouse for evaluation. This is a larger wired plastic moulded mouse. The wire has a braided rather than plastic housing. The mouse is a little bigger than average size. It has a thumbrest on the left side and a finger rest on the right side. the laser light is very sensitive and this mouse can really fly. It is also heavy when fully weighted. The mouse is heavy enough to move my mouse pad. the scroll wheel has a rubbery net like cover to give it texture and is ratcheted; it doesn't spin free.on the top of the mouse outside the left click pad is a button that can be set for double or triple clicks. It is out of the way and a reach to use. The forward and back buttons are near the top left side edge and are also a bit of a reach to hit. colored lights shine windows cut into the top of the mouse. he colors can be changes from yellow, to green , the blue , to purple and to red. The colors can be set to remain constant or to flash on and off. through Behind the forward and back buttons is another button that will turn off the mouses lighting. Pushing this on off button together with a button near the scroll wheel in various combinations allows you to select the colors. it is very clumsy. It is also easy to hit the on of light button when bending your thumb to reach the back button. The on off button is supposed to control the dpi rate and a red lights flash three times when the speed is change. The red lights flash three times but it is the button near the scroll wheel that selects the mouse's speed. This must be part of this mouses new design. There used to be an on off switch on he bottom of the mouse but that has been eliminated in this new design. when the lights are turned off part the laser glows through part of the top of the mouse. The laser turns off when the mouse isn't in use. This will either make the mouse last longer or wear it out faster from the constant turning on and off. This is a very good product for anyone wanting a hefty mouse with accurate movement and adjustable speeds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R316J2U1JA6JX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156KIS8O#wasThisHelpful","R316J2U1JA6JX8","AGV0RUQJHFW3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGV0RUQJHFW3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CopperJoint was kind enough to send me a sample knee sleeve for evaluation. I cant figure out why it works, but it does. I have a hyper-extended knee. I've tried knee braces and they have no effect. This CopperJoint sleeve shouldn't work. It is as shear as a nylon stocking. It's not opaque and you can see through the fabric. The only support is from a thin seam in the back. Yet when I wear the sleeve I don't have any knee pain. I thought  that maybe the sleeve would only be good for knees cranky in cold weather but it is summer time here.  The sleeve seems well made. The sewn seams are fairly invisible. There is a double  line of what looks like hot glue  that runs around the inside of the top collar for some unknown reason. The elastic hasn't stretched out of shape so far. Maybe the hot glue will preserve the elasticity. The sleeve is almost small enough to ball up hidden in my fist but it extends from almost mid thigh to almost mid calf.  After wearing the sleeve for 4 hours or so It feels like I'm still wearing it after I take it off. This phantom sleeve feeling lasts for hours.

"Ruban was kind enough to send me a sample scanner and stand for evaluation. This is an easy to use trigger operated scanner. It comes with a easy to assemble stand that requires tightening two screws to put together. The stand is bendable and light weight but the base can be screwed in place. The scanner has a loud beep that I can still hear while wearing 33db earplugs so it will work even on a noisy shop floor. When the reader is used as a wand the a light on top of the wand goes out when the laser is activated but does not come on when it read a barcode. A read barcode makes the wand beep. The scanner requires no adjusting to work. In the box was a foldout  with various barcodes to set up the device. One of the choices is continuous mode so you can use the device in the stand without having to press the trigger.  Trying to change the speed by scanning these barcodes did not have any effect that I noticed.  As it is set out of the box I am able to scan about a barcode a second. The data cable that powers the device is about 6 foot long. I was able to get an incorrect reading once by turning a barcode upside down. Other than that one time I could not fool the scanner.

"This is a quality made money clip Nice leather and stitching.  Very sturdily made and a strong magnet. I do feel $50.00 is a pretty steep price for such a small item. In my opinion $30.00 would be a fair price for this tiny gem. But as the old saying goes ""you get what you pay for.""  If it holds up and still looks nice years from now it will take some of the sting out of the high price. A suggestion to the manufacture for future design improvement would be to have the opening end slightly flared out on both flaps. This would make it easier to slip your finger in to open it. As I stated, it has a pretty strong magnet, and that is a good thing. It is small touches like that that would differentiate it from an ordinary clip and make the $50.00 price more palatable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DB6JDT69RAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058ZB13W#wasThisHelpful","R23DB6JDT69RAK","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The  price range of this quality of band is interesting to try and rate. It is inexpensive yet looks fairly nice. It is definitely not a luxury band but that being said it is not bad either. It is too soon to know how it will hold up over time. If the manufacture made the band a little thicker it would have a more expensive look to it. But it is not overly puny either. I have compared it to the Apple Leather Loop (for thickness) and the Apple is definitely thicker. But not $130.00 thicker which is about the difference in price. Now don't get me wrong, the Apple Band is top quality right down to the way it attaches to the watch. But for under $25.00 this band is not that bad in the way it looks. I doubt that it will keep its looks for years if you wear it every day. But if you change bands quite frequently as I like to do you could get some decent usage from these bands. When I first opened the bands (I bought two, black and blue) my first impression was to send them back. But after examining them for a while and then comparing them to the Apple Band and determining there was not a $130.00 difference in quality, I decided to keep them. These bands are not great but also not that bad. If they hold up without the leather cracking in non stress areas, they will be worth keeping. If the leather does crack, then I am not out that much money. And I have no issues with them attaching to the watch, but they don't attach as smoothly as the Apple Band. More thickness would make this band perfect even if the price was increased a bit. While the Apple Band is better quality, it is ridiculously priced. I have purchased top quality leather bands from jewelry stores for other watches for 75.00 or less and they were great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17OMVOEJVUKEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XP4VHT6#wasThisHelpful","R17OMVOEJVUKEG","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands down the nicest wallet iPhone case I have come across so far. It is top quality. The leather and stitching are perfect. I purchased the croc black case. It is crafted to perfection, nothing cheap or any shortcuts here. I chose this model because there is a fastener to keep the case closed even when full. I have my driver license and three cards plus a small amount of cash in it. It locks shut and looks good even when full. The company responded to my question about compatibility with an iPhone 6s plus should I purchase one in the future. They responded to my email within a couple of hours. They said this current case will fit the upcoming iPhone 6s plus. I was glad to hear that. This case exudes luxury right down to the gun metal colored trim edging where the phone snaps in. This company also makes a case similar to this one that does not use any type of lock/snap closure. It is beautiful too but this particular case fits my needs better because I like the ability to snap shut the case. If you desire a wallet style case this one has an executive look and feel to it and is top quality down to every detail. It also does not interfere with any of the ports on the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XQF3ZCTPHYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIJFGGS#wasThisHelpful","R21XQF3ZCTPHYY","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the money this is a beautiful case. It is finished very nice. The stitching is good and the overall appearance of the leather is nice. When using the case with no card in it the magnet will keep the case closed if the case is laying down or in an upright position when on a charging stand. It is a very weak magnet. That can be bad and good at the same time. The good is that you can open the case with one hand should you need to if your other hand has something in it by flipping it open. Very easy to open the magnetic closure.The bad is that you cannot put one single card in it and expect the magnet to keep the case secured. It just won't stay closed. A slightly stronger magnet would solve this problem. One other reviewer also mentioned that the case covered part of the speaker port. That is true but I have not noticed a reduction in sound. Why not put that holding piece on the other side of the phone where there are no ports?The case keeps the phone very slim. If you have no intention of placing a card in it you will be fine. Since I am using Apple Pay wherever I can I was hoping to keep my driver license in the slot. Won't work. I even tried placing it under the phone. No go, won't stay closed. So I am just going to use this as a phone case only. Really does look good. It is too new for me to tell you how it will hold up but it looks like if you take reasonable care of it you will be fine.With a little modification this could be a 5 star case. But since you can't really use it as intended, it gets 3 stars from me. If it was advertised as a case only and the case didn't cover part of the speaker port (which again I can't tell any reduction in sound, just a poor design feature) it would get the full five stars. As a case only and the fact that part of the speaker port is covered I would give it 4 stars only because of that poor design factor. I want to clarify that I am rating the case that holds one card on the inside of the case.Update:  I like the way this company responds to reviews that are less than perfect. They are cordial and polite and listen for future improvements to their products. I want to reiterate that this case makes a perfect leather flip style case. Very sophisticated/executive looking. I am using it without a card in it. As a case only it is perfect. As I mentioned earlier there is a piece of the case that covers the last two holes of the speaker. But there are 5 holes left uncovered. I can't tell any difference in the volume level with the case on v.s. off.  If you want to use it with a card you can and if you don't mind the case staying slightly ajar you will be fine with it. The case is beautiful for the money and I am going to use it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP5VVCWARM7HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0IFC8M#wasThisHelpful","RP5VVCWARM7HR","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice wallet and has plenty of space for your cards and cash. This is my second wallet, the first one is tan, this one is brown. For the money it is very good quality. As you know you can spend $100.00 plus for designer name wallets. The way it will hold up and look nice depends on how you take care of it as with any wallet. I have read some reviews where the finish will wear off on the edges especially where it folds. This is true as that has happened with my tan wallet even though it is minor. I found a way to disguise the wear and you can't even tell it. Get a magic marker close to the color of your wallet and rub lightly along the edge where the finish rubbed off. Problem solved. In the case of the light tan wallet I used a maple wood colored staining pen used for furniture touch up. I can't attest to how well it blocks thieves trying to electronically scan your cards but it is nice knowing it is supposed to block those signals. All-in-all this is a $50.00 wallet that has a $100.00 look, feel and smell to it. For all it holds it is not majorly large too. While it is not little, it is a pretty good space saving wallet. I have a total of eleven cards in it which includes driver's license and insurance card plus cash. You would think it would be bulging at the seams but it is not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO12MHQ22VQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HC65N9S#wasThisHelpful","R2AO12MHQ22VQ7","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones exude pure luxury. They smell like a fine leather coat or the way an expensive pair of dress leather shoes smell when you open the box. Their craftmanship is impeccable. No plastic or cheapness of any kind on these headphones. They are very comfortable. They are not as light as some headphones but that is due to the use of metals instead of plastic. But that being said they are still not heavy.If I had to classify these headphones as a dress accessory they would be under formal attire, or executive business attire. To me they look more suited for a man because they have a business executive masculine look to them but that is a matter of opinion. If headphones can draw attention, these definitely will.Now on to sound quality. They sound fantastic. But here is the deal. If you are comming from a cheaper set of headphones the difference will be dramatic. If you are comming from a quality set of headphones such as Bose, the sound difference will be less dramatic at first and except for the fine craftmanship you will wonder if they are worth the extra money. However after repeated listening here is what I found. The sound gets even better after a breaking in period. After repeated listening and comparison to other quality headphones these headphones have a richness and warmth to the sound that becomes obvious as you keep listening. Are they better than say a good set of Bose? Let's just say they are different in a good way.These headphones have the capability of reproducing different aspects of sound that you didn't hear before depending on the device you are using them with. For example they sound very good when using an iPhone or iPod. But if you really want to get them singing with an iPhone/iPod and get more out of them buy yourself a portable DAC headphone amplifier. I purchased a light weight Sony PHA-1A model from Amazon and the difference is between day and night with the sound quality and volume. The amplifier is also great with your computer. You can also listen with the headphone jack on your stereo receiver because of the adaptor plug included with the headphones. With your stereo system the headphones are superb.To me these headphones are best suited to home or relaxed settings where you can sit or lie back, chill out and do some serious listening. Even though you could take them on a run or even to the gym I just won't do it. This is a luxury item that makes me want to treat it as such. I have Beats Studio Wireless and Bose Wireless for those activities. They are great headphones too but better suited for the gym or activities.I like the way they made the thickly padded ear cushions easily removable should they need replacing to change the audio cords when you need to, or for replacement should they ever wear out. I can't see replacing them for many years unless they are abused.All-in-all these are a great set of headphones both in look and sound. I am sure that all headphones in this class, wired $400.00 range will have superior sound in their own way. What it may boil down to is the look and style of the headphone in addition to the sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN1DDH198CYK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6PRSMW#wasThisHelpful","RN1DDH198CYK9","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable is just the right size to use in the storage area of your car where you would attach your iPhone/iPod  through the USB port and then close the storage area door for concealing purposes. You don't have a ton of extra cable to deal with. However if you want to use the device  outside of the storage area you will need a longer cable. It works great with my iPhone and car sound system. It is certified to Apple's specifications according to the manufacturer. All functions of the phone work perfectly and sound quality through the car system is fine too. Once my phone is attached I use the touch screen on the dash and steering wheel controls to operate the iPhone and use the hands free system for calls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A36XBPC52FVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZTI6MQ#wasThisHelpful","R1A36XBPC52FVY","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At this point I am only using this device with an iPhone 6 Plus and iPod Touch Fifth Generation. I previously purchased the Bowers and Wilkins P7 Headphones from Amazon. They sound pretty good just using the Apple devices but I wanted to see if better sound could be coaxed out of these headphones. I researched and settled on this Sony PHA1A DAC Amplifier. It is not cheap and I was planning on sending it back if it did not make the headphones sound better. I am proud to report it will not be going back. The headphones really came alive with added richness to the sound and more volume than you will ever need. To realize what this little gem can do you must have a high end set of headphones however. It is very sleek and light weight. These headphones along with this device are not what I would be using during activity like exercising, running, the gym, etc.  To me they are for when you are in a relaxing environment and you just want to sit or lay back and chill out with the music. I am pleased with it. It is too bad for that money they did not include an AC wall charger for it. The wall charger is an added accessory if you don't want to charge it through the computer. It does use micro USB for charging however. And since it says made for IPod/iPhone Apple products you would think they would have added an appropriate size lightning cable. They added every other type of cable for connection. I do like the unit enough to keep it. If it had made only a marginal difference in the sound quality I would have sent it back but it pleasantly surprised me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWAXIETCF08K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIAYRDO#wasThisHelpful","R1HWAXIETCF08K","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are exceptionally nice valve stem covers. However they do not fit my 2015 Sonata 2.0T Limited with the 18 inch wheels properly. When I say ""properly"" I mean they are not deep enough to cover the entire valve stem. Plus this particular tire valve stem flanges out at the base. These valve stem covers cover about 3/4 of the valve stem. And also the tire valve stem is brass (gold) color. These stem covers are chrome. If they covered the entire stem thread they would be ok. But since they don't you see the gold where the chrome cover stops. I just didn't like the way they looked and fit. I give them a 5 star rating because they are very well made and good quality.

"I will start by saying this is a ""slim fit"" shirt. I did not know this when I initially ordered it in medium size. In a regular shirt I wear medium. But in a slim fit I wear large. The medium fit like a rubber glove. The large is perfect. So when I say ""fits as expected"", I mean for a slim fit shirt.  This shirt is designed for ""fit"" guys. If you are over weight this may not be the shirt for you. That being said the shirt fabric is excellent quality. The stripe design is designer. You most probably won't see anything like it out there. Is it expensive? YES. Is it too expensive? YES. But if you want a casual shirt in your wardrobe that is comfortable with quality material and tailoring and a look that stands out from the rest, this one will do it.

"Finally a pouch holster that fits an iPhone 6 Plus with a case on it. The Speigen Tough Armor case fits right in it and it would accept an even larger case. I have to tell you it is big on your waist, but comfortable. You have to expect big with such a large phone. It is very easy to remove the phone when needed. I bought it because I was always carrying the phone in my hand and would lay it on the counter in stores and would sometimes leave it. I thought to myself one day I am going to loose that phone. This holster solves that problem. Before I could not find a holster large enough to hold the phone with a case on it. It appears well made. The clip is a little tough to open but that should improve with use.

"I ordered this holster to use with my iPhone 6 plus case in conjunction with the Speigen Tough Armor Case. In my experience the holster fits the case perfectly. I am not going to comment on the durability of the plastic release tab because I am returning the holster immediately. I will say that the release tab does function properly out of the package. My problem is that the hard plastic of the latch has to rub along the side and edge of the Tough Armor case to secure it. This leaves fine scratches and rubs the finish off of the edge of the case where the pressure points are the strongest. I noticed this with just a few openings and closings of the latch. At this point it is minor but with repeated usage it will just keep marring the finish further. It is too bad they did not place some felt lining under the latch to eliminate the marring. And I opened and closed it with care. This may not bother some people but it bothers me. I realize the Speigen case is not the most expensive case out there but it is very nice looking and has nice finish colors. I keep my phone in pristine condition and I don't want marring and scratches on it. For this reason I am returning it and am buying a leather holster pouch designed to hold this large phone with a case on it. If it had not been for this one problem I would have kept the holster because (at least out of the package) it functioned well. It also fit the phone with case perfectly and it looks pretty good. As to how it would have held up, I will never know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJB55RPVLSUBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OS8ZRO4#wasThisHelpful","RJB55RPVLSUBA","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just received this dock and I really like it. Unlike some reviews I have read this dock appears to be an original Twelve South Dock. All parts including the back post align perfectly. I even received the Twelve South appliqué another reviewer said was missing from their box. This was an Amazon-Twelve South purchase, not from a third party vendor.As other reviewers have stated you must use the smaller 1 millimeter Apple cable. My iPhone 6 plus was shipped with the 2 millimeter cable so I used the cable I was using for my iPod Touch. The unit assembles pretty easily. I tested the dock plugs with my case on my phone before inserting into the post. I use the Speigen Tough Armor Case and the number 2 plug fits perfectly. The case is stable enough. I do use my second hand to hold the base when removing the phone. I have had to do that with other docks too. Under normal circumstances the phone is secure on the dock. Small children with prying fingers could topple it.I would like to mention to Twelve South that if they used a magnetized Allen wrench it would make inserting those four screws much easier. I mean this is a premium dock so it would be nice to have a premium experience assembling it. I also had to work with it to keep the wire cover snap out piece on the underside bottom of the base from coming loose even though the cable was firmly seated in the grooves. I removed the little cellophane type ""pull"" piece and then is snapped and stayed in place.Over all I am very pleased with the premium look and the functionality of this dock. My back support works perfectly and fully supports the back of the phone. And the absolute best thing I like about this dock is it should work with future iPhones. The design is ingenious. The one thing I hate is spending a lot of money for an iPhone accessory only to have it rendered useless when Apple redesigns their phone. This dock is so adjustable that I believe that problem will be eliminated with future phones unless Apple has a very radical design change such as curving the phones.  And the fact that this dock will work with a large variety of cases out there is the biggest plus of all.I decided to take a picture of the dock. Some previous reviews have stated that the back post is cut incorrectly rendering the back support useless. They obviously did not receive an actual ""Twelve South"" dock. As you can see my back support aligns perfectly. Again, I ordered this through Amazon Prime - Twelve South, not a third party vendor. I feel you are pretty safe by ordering the dock this way. And if something is wrong it is much easier returning to Amazon vs. a vendor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VK7GFD95YTPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3ALGVA#wasThisHelpful","R2VK7GFD95YTPI","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was skeptical when I ordered this cover. My plans were to protect the watch when I was at the gym. However after seeing this cover on the watch I plan to leave it on all the time. It fits like a glove and the cutouts for the digital crown, side button and band release buttons are superb. You can barely tell it is on the watch. I read a review from another reviewer concerning the dot pattern on the case. He is correct but to be honest I did not notice the dot pattern until I read his review. Upon close examination I saw the pattern. But the case is clear and let's the beauty of the watch shine through. It also protects the sides and edges of the crystal. Every portion of the metal part of the watch, top and bottom is protected with this cover. There is a cut out circle on the bottom so it does not interfere with the charge surface. If you want a cover that offers good protection under normal use and does not hide the beauty of the watch, this is your cover. It does not cover the crystal so if you are in to rock or mountain climbing you might want a hard case cover and a crystal protector. This unit is easy to install. It stretches over the watch and fits perfectly in place. I took the bands off first (very easy to do) then installed the cover and replaced the bands. Took about one minute. I am including a close up picture that actually shows the dot pattern. But keep in mind this is a closeup. Under normal circumstances you will find it hard to focus in on this pattern.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R130PPWQR8RMHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVSNKWQ#wasThisHelpful","R130PPWQR8RMHB","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The large size should be able to hold most items carried in a traditional wallet unless you have it stuffed and bulging at the seams.

"To be fair I know you are not going to get a lot of quality out of a queen size bed skirt that costs $15.00. So I am not going to be too critical of this manufacturer except for the way they advertise it. If you buy this you are getting $15.00 worth of quality, and that is not much. But that should be expected. I have seen bargain 150 count thread sheets that are luxurious compared to this. My beef is they make it sound as if you are getting luxurious quality by stating 1,500 thread count. I think someone does not know how to count. It does rip easily and it is very thin. The fit is ok for a 15 inch drop. If you are looking for a very inexpensive bed skirt with limited quality but does serve the purpose this is it. Just don't expect longevity out of it.

"Writing a review for underwear is difficult. Different body sizes and shapes plus individual likes and dislikes makes a review kind of useless. However, I can tell you what I like about them. The fabric is comfortable. I am average size, 6 feet & 170 lbs with a 34 inch waist. Even though the size chart says my measurement size for this underwear is a medium, I disagree. Large is perfect for me. Not loose and not too tight. I have been wearing this style for a long time. I find the pouch style to be comfortable and supportive. The horizontal fly is perfect. I find a vertical opening to be cumbersome and next to useless after using the horizontal opening. So to sum it up, this style is definitely worth a try.Update:  I have read from other reviewers stating the quality of this underwear is going down. I just noticed a hole in one pair of the briefs after 3 washings in a front loading washing machine. Front loaders are easy on clothes. I was surprised to find this and it could be that this pair is defective. The hole is at a seam.

"This car seat gap fits my 2010 Camry well and looks very good. It totally closes the gap and almost looks like it came with the car. The beige shade does not totally match the seat but blends well. It is a very tight fit which is good. But because of the tight fit it squeals because of the faux leather rubbing the side of the console when moving the seats back or forward. This is not a big deal to me because the seats are hardly ever moved. But even if they were constantly moved I would still use them. It they were made of a cloth material they probably wouldn't squeal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AI47VFQCNH7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV45SCY#wasThisHelpful","R2AI47VFQCNH7I","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like these key finders. They function as advertised and I like the fact that they are color coded. I keep the key remote in a drawer with a note where I jotted down which color belongs to each key. It is imparitive that you keep the remote in a safe place where you will always know where it is located. The remote works well with each fob and works at a decent distance and is reasonably loud. You may have to walk around in search mode with the remote but if the key fob is anywhere in sight it will find it. I agree with another reviewer that an improvement would be an even slimmer (wafer thin) fob. This would be very useful for wallets. The current fob causes a slight amount of bulging. But all-in-all these are nice key finders and I am comfortable with them. They are great for items hiding in the house or in a coat pocket.  If your key is hidden in a couch or pocket you will need a quiet environment to hear them because the beeping will be muffled. So with that said maybe a sharper or higher pitch would be welcome too. But don't let that stop you. They have located keys for me two times since I purchased them. When it finds the item you are so glad you have them. Less searching on my part.UPDATE:  I have a great idea for an enhancement to this product due to a problem I encountered. This is not a defect with the product. Recently I was searching for one set of my keys that was missing. I thought ""great"" my handy dandy key finder will help me. But it didn't. And the reason was because the battery in the locater attached to the keys had gone dead. This happened several months after I purchased the key finder. I would like to hear a ""low battery"" chirp in each key finder. This way you would be warned when the battery was weak. To me this is very necessary because if the battery dies you are lost at sea. In the interim my suggestion would be to test each key finder every month. This will give you a better chance of not encountering a dead battery when you need it most. By the way, I found the keys. But it was the old fashioned way. I searched until I found them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9J4WSR82RGKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JJJ7S4#wasThisHelpful","R9J4WSR82RGKI","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This band is much nicer than the band that comes with the Pebble due to the fact that the band is the same width as the watch.

I tried everything to reinstall it into the band but it would not stay in place. I gave up and reinstalled the band that came with the Pebble.

"You can totally change the look of your Pebble watch with this product. It adheres nicely and holds strong. That being said I wish the company could design them in a way where they could be taken off and reused if you want to change colors or styles. Technically you can but it is very difficult to remove without damaging the skin. At $9.00 a wrap it would be nice to reuse them when changing styles. They are fairly easy to install and easy to shift and adjust before you apply pressure to make them adhere to the watch. Once adhered they will stay in place. Making them easier to remove and reinstall would get a five star rating from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2479Z4BKTD39U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IAOS668#wasThisHelpful","R2479Z4BKTD39U","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This watch is great for voice commands. I have an iPhone 5s and it excels with its interaction with Siri. The function is identical to using the phone. It is also not too bad with text messages. It will scroll the entire message across its small screen if you set it to do so. The message scrolls as soon as the phone receives it. It is HORRIBLE with email messages. It displays very limited information with email messages. And if you get more than one it only lets you know that you have email messages waiting which you will have to read on the phone.  If you were not wearing the watch at the time the texts or emails came through, the watch gives no indication of waiting notifications. Emails don't come across as soon as they hit the phone. The watch syncs with the phone in 3 minute intervals at the fastest setting. The leather band is not the best in quality. Going back to voice command, the watch speaks clear and loud. As stated previously it excels in this area. Siri functions perfectly and you can tell Siri to play music and it plays clearly through the watch. Here is the bottom line for me:  If you like voice command and talking through your watch, this is your smart watch for now. If you rely on text messages, this watch is good as long as you are with the watch when the text comes through. If you need good email notification, this watch doesn't make the cut. If it excelled at all three I would have kept the watch. But $300.00 is a lot to pay for a watch that has a poorly designed notification system for my needs.  I also own a Pebble Watch. It's text and email notification is very good to excellent and it also stores your notifications so you can call them back up. You cannot talk through it however. For now my suggestion would be to buy a Pebble if you want smart watch functionality. It works very good in all that it is designed to do. The technology is constantly improving in this market. Also as far as the watch reading your emails and texts through Siri - you can do this through the Martian Watch. But at no fault to the watch, Siri is sporadic with the way it reads emails. Sometimes you get the whole email and sometimes you only get the subject line. Texts are better. That being said I still in many instances have to pull out the phone to review many of the emails. If I have to do this then the watch is not as useful. I'm just saying for the price of the watch I should be able to completely rely on it. Sending emails and messages with the watch through Siri works much better. This watch needs a better system for visually reviewing emails and texts.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9M1UC1CZAM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FI16HS0#wasThisHelpful","R1C9M1UC1CZAM5","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this case. It fully protects all 4 sides and the back of the iPod Touch. There is no way you could damage the iPod on the sides or back by dropping it from any distance. It also has ""lay on the table screen protection"". The glass screen could be damaged by dropping if it hit an object in a certain way. To eliminate this issue I would suggest a ""case friendly"" screen protector. This case has a fantastic grip to it. It won't be slipping out of your hand. It is a tough built case but not bulky. It makes the iPod feel like a lighter iPhone. Because of the toughness the buttons are a little harder to press (they are covered by the case) but they press and operate fine. If you are looking for a case that has very good drop protection and easy to grip, this is your case especially when used with a screen protector. I should mention this case is not waterproof but would shield some rain. The bottom ports are not sealed. Overall I can highly recommend this case. The only time you would be in trouble is if you dropped it in a body of water. The case has a great feel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120MXFU1V8CMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4CNKDA#wasThisHelpful","R120MXFU1V8CMN","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wish you could carpet the whole bathroom with this product. You could almost sleep on them.UPDATE:  After using these rugs for several months it became time to clean them. They are very thick rugs due to the fact that they have memory foam in them. That being said they can be washed but they take FOREVER to become bone dry. Even placing them in the sun takes forever. Once washed and finally dry their appearance is not the same. They loose that new look and the fibers look matted. I tried to vacuum them but it doesn't help much. They have a matted down look. They are still very soft and comfortable to walk on but their good looks are gone. Most bathroom rugs/carpet will wash and look very fluffy after dried in a dryer. These rugs while very nice do not launder and keep their fresh appearance nearly as well as standard bathroom rugs. Because of this I am knocking my rating down to a three.

"This unit would not work properly with my iPhone 5s. So why the 5 star rating?  The answer: because Olens Technology has the best customer service I have ever seen. The Renny would not stay connected to my phone. I contacted Olens Technology and they worked with me in every way imaginable to correct the issue including sending me a second unit. It too would not stay connected to this phone. Olens Technology paid to ship both units back to them and I was not out a penny. They are outstanding. Now to the unit. When it was connected it worked perfectly. It was loud and clear. For some reason it just did not like this phone, or the phone did not like it. The company tells me that there is a very small percentage of iOS devices (Apple) experiencing this issue and they are investigating the problem.  My recommendation:  Go ahead and try the unit. If it stays connected to your phone without disconnecting as mine did, you will have a valuable quality made Bluetooth ringer. If for some reason it doesn't function properly you will have no problem returning it. I might add that this is a finely crafted element looking device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAS6B7SBQC1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EGWIV04#wasThisHelpful","R3GAS6B7SBQC1Y","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did not purchase this case through Amazon. I purchased it directly through the Element Case website. It is a solid, well built case. It is a little bulky but that is to be expected of a case that is designed to highly protect a case from drops. This case has one design flaw at least in my experience with it. The flash cut out is very deep and it is white. When you take a flash picture the white cut out of the case causes the flash to reflect back into the lens. This results in a very cloudy/milky picture. It took me a while to figure this out because I thought I was not using the camera correctly. It finally hit me that the case may be causing the problem so I took it off. The result was crystal clear flash pictures. I reinstalled the case and had the same cloudy flash problem. I contacted Element and they are replacing the Rogue Case with a different case. I don't know if this problem exists with the black Rogue cases because the cutout is black, not white as on the gold model. I thought I should let people know of the problem I experienced with this case.

"This is a nice basic cover for the iPod Touch 5th Generation. It fits perfectly and the clear model lets the color of the iPod through. It also  makes the iPod much easier (less slippery) to hold. It will provide protection from scratches on the back. It will offer drop protection if the drop hits the back of the iPod. However if you need moderate to serious drop protection, this is not the case, especially if the drop hits the front at the top or bottom of the iPod.  There is also no ""lay on the table"" protection for the screen. Still, if you are easy on your electronics you will like the simplicity of this case and the protection from scuffs and scratches on the back. A screen saver will help protect the screen from scratches if needed. All ports have easy accessibility. I have no use for the strap so the opening for attachment of the strap is a moot issue for me.

"Before purchasing this shredder I read all of the reviews on Amazon. There is only one negative thing that I agree with other reviewers and that is the poor design for moving the shredder. There really are no handles on the machine to grasp to move it. You have to tilt the machine and hold on to the flat sides to move it. Why recesses weren't made on the sides for something to hold on to is beyond me. That being said it is still not that difficult to move if you need to. Just don't let it slip from your hands. Everything else about the machine is perfect. It is powerful and fairly quiet.  It has a large bin. The unit is very high tech looking with all of the blue led lights on the top of the unit. It makes it look very impressive and professional for a paper shredder.

"These are very nice and comfortable wearing headphones. The headphone paired with my iPhone 5 in a snap. They are very nice looking. I especially like the leather/vinyl ear pads. In fact that is why I chose them. I am using these specifically at the gym. The leather covering to me is much easier to clean than foam coverings found on other phones. They function properly except for when trying to place a call with them. During music playback they work perfectly with answering a call. However when placing a call (which is not that important to me) they activate Siri to initiate the call but she does not follow through with the voice command. Sometimes she will but most of the time she won't. Now on to the sound quality. You can't expect these headphones to perform like a $150.00 plus  set of phones. To me there is very little treble with these phones. Some music sounds muffled (depending on the recording). In fact I keep the sound setting on my iPhone to ""Treble Booster"" to be able to use these phones. That being said I like them, however I wish the company had tweaked them to give clearer voice and high notes. Any headphone in this price range is not for serious listening. However for casual listening during workouts or runs they are ok. The convenience of not dealing with dangling cords and earplugs is worth it for me to keep them. I can recommend them but don't expect outstanding sound quality.Update:In all fairness to the company that produces these headphones I feel compelled to give an updated review. After using these headphones for more days now they seem to be somewhat clearer than they were. This could be because they are breaking in, or, my ears are adjusting to them or a combination of both. That being said they are producing a cleaner sound in the treble range. It also made a call with Siri today. You have to speak loudly to the microphone and wait for all responses from Siri. I believe once you get the feel for making the call it will be ok. While these would never be my serious headphones for listening to music, they are perfect for the gym or any activity such as running, etc. I am upping the rating to 4 stars. I am happy with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2MZ4BCC7BTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3OXHTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1N2MZ4BCC7BTP","A1JT5SPO1DXJGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JT5SPO1DXJGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased these speakers to use as surround speakers. In my opinion this function is what they were intended for. Used as surround speakers they are great. They reflect the background channels very well. They are also very easy to install them on a wall or ceiling. I have mine installed high on the back wall tilting down. In another room I have a second set installed on the ceiling tilting slightly downward. The ease in which they install is one of the reasons I purchased them. They also sound very good for surround purposes and they look good. I don't believe they would make a very good left and right front channel speaker. They just don't have the sound quality for main speakers in my opinion. That being said I am very happy with them as surround speakers. This is actually my second set because I have surround systems in two separate rooms. I was pleased with the first set.

"This is a very quality product and fits the iPhone 5 perfectly. Looks awesome. The only issue I had with it was the peel off paper attached to the adhesive on the backside of the wrap pulled the entire adhesive strip off of the skin. This was due to the fact that I removed it improperly. I did not realize what was happening until after it was done. Be careful when removing the adhesive cover. I thought I had ruined it but the wrap was still tacky on the back side. I put it on the phone and it stayed in place and does not move or shift. That was months ago and I see no issues of it coming loose or peeling up. I get many compliments on this skin. Just be careful when removing the adhesive cover. Now I would know how to remove it without peeling the entire adhesive strip off. You can actually pull the whole thing off without realizing it until it is too late.

"These cushions are very comfortable, the same as the original cushions That being said I wish they were made of a more durable cushion cover. I babied the original cushions by never allowing any sweat or body oils to accumulate on them. I would actually clean my ears to prevent oils from getting on them before putting them on. Still after a few years the cover material cracked and disintegrated. I might also add that I also don't wear them that much. I am sure these replacement cushions will suffer the same fate because the material is the same. I can just imagine what would have happened to them had I not maintained them so well.

"This is a well made Karcher accessory. It is a must if you want to clean high eaves or even one or two story houses. I like the item because it allows you to stand farther back and not get sprayed down with as much water. If you are cleaning eaves you are back far enough as to not have water pouring down on you.

"I purchased this item from Brand Variety through Amazon. It works like a charm and pivots to any angle for ease of use. I was surprised at the power of the rotating brush. It takes a lot of pressure force to bog it down and stop it from rotating. That being said it cleans very well. The quality of the bristles are nice too. They are not stiff and abrasive. Perfect for cleaning windows. This Karcher brush is quality made. It is expensive, but in this case you get an above average accessory. There is another rotating Karcher rotating brush out there that does not pivot. I purchased it locally before purchasing the pivoting brush through Amazon. For my needs the non-pivoting brush is useless except for very basic cleaning due to the fact that you can't angle it. The brushes are also much stiffer. If you need this type of brush do yourself a favor and buy the pivoting brush.

"This is a beautiful watch that comes in beautiful packaging. As I write this, the Amazon price is $83.50 - which makes this a five star purchase. On opening, the package that new leather smell wafts out. This would make a very nice gift because the whole presentation is just outstanding.The pearlescent-ish watch face has gold trimming and some black lettering, all of it flawless. The brushed gold colored case sets off the watch face nicely. The band is supple with excellent stitching. The stainless steel back plate is nicely patterned with Invicta branding. It all looks very... fancy.The watch case itself is 42mm diameter. What this means in practice is that it is kinda big and looks overly large on my wrist. BUT... that's the style of late with some smart watches being even bigger.The watch box is amazingly well executed too and appears to be made with real leather and nice stitching. Probably a keeper for storage and showing off.I think this watch is available at its current price because smart watches are becoming such a thing. This watch is just a watch.

"This gadget asks questions until it -maybe- figures out what you're thinking about. I like it because it looks cool, has pretty blinking lights, and occasionally figures out something obscure. For example, it figured out those Naboo star fighters. Over all, I think this toy isn't supposed to be all that capable, just fun to mess with. It is fun to mess with.Something frustrating is that it doesn't rephrase questions at all and so many questions make no sense. The first question is always ""being, location, or technology."" It is frustrating when it's a location, such as the Varykino lake retreat (Padme & Anaken wedding pavilion) and the gadget asks: ""Are they a pilot."" So very many irrelevant questions. A little more software sophistication would have made this so much cooler. It is generally this way. That said, it kinda makes sense to ask if a technology is someone specific (R2D2).But - it is a fun gadget and it does attract curious hands.All in all, it is amazing that the Jedi holocron can guess some obscure beings, locations, and technologies.

"I've tested a fair number of these FRS/GMRS radios, have an amateur radio license, and occasionally get designated ""radio man"" and end up handing out radios to groups of people. I settled on the MT350 (now out of production) a few years ago and bought a bunch of them. For the most part, the T480 is an upgraded version of my beloved MT350s.First off - performance. The T480 delivers well. The FRS channels are low power channels and the only reason I know of to use them is because someone brought a radio that can't operate on GMRS. Frown at such people. Confiscate their radio. No, you won't get 35 miles with this radio unless maybe both transmitter and receiver are on mountain tops in a remote place without other transmitters. This being very unlikely, don't expect more than 3 or 4 miles and even less if people are indoors. I've tried other brands in this price range and the ""35 mile"" Motorola talkabouts gave me the best useful range. Note: there are also ""20 mile"" talkabouts. Don't use them.Batteries - The most important thing here is that these radios accept standard AA batteries -and- come with rechargeable packs. The rechargeable packs make life easy close to civilization. The AA compatibility makes life easy when recharging isn't going to happen.  The T480 comes with a 800mAH hour battery. My old MT350s have 650 mAH batteries. They are interchangeable. Sweet!Recharging is via micro USB. Good. The world is full of micro USB chargers.Other stuff - I'd love it if the radio were smaller and came in much brighter colors. These things get dropped and misplaced a lot (Don't get the black ones - they vanish). The ""whistle"" is a joke. The belt clip doesn't have tension and should't be trusted -but- the lanyard attachments are great because they are on the radio center line. This means the radio hangs well from the lanyard. Use the lanyard, throw away the clip.The buttons are wonderfully functional. The T480 emergency button is easier to push by accident than the MT350 one. The MT350 had it between the antenna and volume knob. The T480 has it right below the push-to-talk button which is less than ideal placement.These units are fairly weatherproof. They can get rained on and getting wet but they can't handle staying wet.The directions are printed in too small a font. It may seem silly in the 2nd decade of this century, but printed directions that are easy to read in low light are really important.As discussed above, these are great radios for handing out to a group such as a tour group or hiking group. They are rugged and get the job done. Personally, I tend to use an Icom radio that costs a lot more but is waterproof (it floats), transmits more powerfully, and has a better and interchangeable antenna. Using it also requires passing tests to get the right license.These talkabouts really should be waterproof. Kind of like the Moto 360.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIRRCO5KDIO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W75BLTU#wasThisHelpful","R2IIRRCO5KDIO7","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazon curated collection has been a great deal. Good quality at a great price and I've never been disappointed.This particular pendant is very pretty. Very sparkly and eye catching. The product page doesn't show the pendants size. It's about the size of a nickel. I won't comment on the design because different people have different tastes and, mostly, because there's a picture right there for you to look at. Regarding that picture, the actual pendant is way more attractive. As for construction, it's good. It looks like it was assembled by some who cared about doing a good job.The chain is better than most. It's sturdy enough to do its job and is well built.

"This thing is amazing. Just plain amazing. The technology is eye popping. The cars can follow the track on their own and the driver basically selects speed and lane (and fires weapons). The cars are controlled through blue tooth from a phone or tablet. Speed is an on-screen slider, shift lanes by tipping the phone left and right. Each car is a bit different with different speed defense, firepower, and ""special."" Weapons are fired by tapping on screen buttons. It is all very intuitive and outrageously fun.I've only played against other adults. We all had a blast. I think kids would love it too. Especially devious kids with tactical awareness.The hardest thing about getting started is downloading the app, which took a minute. Maybe two. We all skipped the tutorial, so I can't comment on that. We just unpacked it, stuck the cars on the charger, set up the track, and got right to it. There are instructions somewhere. Someone should read them.The track is held together by magnets and it almost assembles itself. The cars charged pretty quickly, and it's off to the races (or battle). Recharge takes a little while, 8ish minutes.There is a tournament mode for battling AI drivers. I haven't tested the AIs much because we went straight to racing person against person. One guy hosts, the other joins. The host selects race, battle, time trial, or ""king of the hill."" The other players select join, and the host double clicks to select participants. It is just amazing watching the cars scan the track and then line up, perfectly line up, at the start line. and then you race, or battle, or whatever.Interesting tid bits... Unlike slot cars, these cars don't go fast enough to fly off the track. Their internal AI keeps them in their lane. Different cars have different top speeds. When a car is disabled, it spins around a bit and can flip itself off the track - neat touch! Sometimes, a car gets turned around and goes backward. The AI notices and spins the car to the right direction.

"OK five stars for completely meeting expectations. How could it not? It is a pizza pan.I think this particular pizza pan is made of aluminum. It seems to weigh nothing.

"This is an oddly useful tent. First off, it isn't exactly a camping tent. It's more of a day shelter or stuff protector. For example, it's nice for getting coolers and gear out of direct sunlight. It's really nice for that. It's also a great little tent for getting yourself out of direct sunlight.As for sleeping in it overnight, maybe. The door doesn't zip shut. Bugs will enter if motivated to do so.Set up is very easy. It took a friend and I less than twp minutes or so to set it up without ever reading the instructions. It's pretty obvious where everything goes. It would have been even faster it the poles were formed a little different. I have other tents where you just toss the pole sections around a bit and the poles rapidly self assemble because of the shapes of the section ends and the elastic band running through the centers. These  poles took a little more jiggling.As a whole, this tent is very nice. The design is very well thought out. Every time you look for a little tie-off, there it is sewn into the tent in the perfect position. Things stay nice and neat because the door, windows, etc can all be gathered and tied so casually.The tent comes with some ""sand bags"" that can help weight down the corners. Nice concept, but those bags end up being used to hold stuff other than sand. Besides, a cooler or human inside the tent effectively weighs it down. Regardless, nice touch. This tent has lots of nice touches.Disassembly and repacking take 4-5 minutes because of the need to shake the crud out, because it's a but tougher to pull the tent poles out than to push them in (the poles run though sewn in channels), and because it takes a little attention to fold, roll up, and get the air out.Over all, this is a nice easy to set up shelter for car camping and tailgating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZTI9BJDQF4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCG8JC#wasThisHelpful","R1AZTI9BJDQF4J","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nitrile gloves are great to have around the house because there are so many times that you need a disposable glove. I constantly find new uses for them. For example, I now use them when polishing shoes because they rub in the wax as well as any rag -and- my hands stay clean. They are also great for any task involving oil. And for cleaning yuck from under the sink. and for handling that potting soil that smells like cow poo. and ...Nitrile is works better for me than latex because it doesn't shred and break as easily. Latex gloves seem almost eager to break. Another nice thing about Nitrile is that it doesn't age as poorly as latex. I once bulk bought latex gloves. A few years later and many of the latex gloves were either cracked or severely weakened. Very frustrating. I have years old Nitrile gloves that are still fine.The Ammex gloves compare well with the Nitrile gloves I get at Walgreens. The material thickness is about the same.

"This apron fits my short n' wide man frame pretty well. Also, the black with white pinstripes works well for males. The material itself is much thicker than the restaurant kitchen aprons I wore back in the day. That makes the apron fairly sturdy. The colors didn't run in the wash machine but the apron did wrinkle up a bit. A few more washes should soften the fabric so that it doesn't hold wrinkles anymore. The apron strings are not long enough for me to -easily- tie the apron in front (34"" waist). I suppose I could tie the apron strings in front if I really wanted to but its easy enough to tie a bow behind my back.As for using the thing. It's great. It is now hanging from a hook on the kitchen wall where it is easy to grab. This is really really important in the summer when I cook bacon shirtless.The two pockets are nice and large.

"I got these at a great price. They were outright affordable. Price is a big issue for a device having a limited life span and far cheaper alternatives. After all, the amazingly log life that is quoted is for just a few hours per day of use.

Easy easy setup and install. It took all of a 1/2 hour to have voice controlled lights in my house (the Amazon Echo does the voice part).The bigger issue is if it is smarter to have smart bulbs or smart wall switches. The problem as of this writing is that the wall switches are flaky. Maybe GE can come out with a line of decent wall switches.What is really interesting is the option to not even have a wall switch. That's why I really like these smart bulbs. The remaining issue is how to be sure that the lights are controllable when the network goes down.

"I have built dozens of computers over the past few decades and it is amazing how much case design keeps improving. This case made for a supremely easy build. The sides, top and bottom come right off and makes installing components most casual. The position of power supply at the bottom with a nice space behind it helps contain the usual nightmare of power cables. A modular power supply helps too. The wires for hooking up the case switches, USB, and LEDs are all well labeled. The build took maybe 1/2 hour.Actually, the build was unintentional. I started checking how the components would fit and ended up just building the thing.There are ample fans of a good size which keeps everything cool and quiet. My build is almost silent with its solid state drive. Also, I selected a motherboard that can drive three monitors because my build is not a gaming PC and doesn't need a graphics card. I, however, need three monitors because I like to have lots of documents/web pages/text files open at once.So... if I could alter anything I'd consider maybe putting the case USB ports on the front instead of on the right hand side near the front.

"This is a well written and engaging book about catching one particular software pirate. What makes it special is that the story is told from the perspective of an assistant US attorney who is not a computer expert by any stretch of the imagination. This makes the book great for a much wider audience than say Tsutomo Shimomura's book, also partially titled ""Takedown,"" who helped catch Kevin Mitnick.This book's author, David Hall, has to rely on experts like Shimomura to bring cyber criminals to justice. Hall is a remarkable author in that he displays very little ego. He is very frank about his thoughts, mistakes and miscues. I don't want to give spoilers, but Hall had a number of different theories about who did what and how. He investigates and -boom- dead theory. Then comes the part that's frightening. The man is relentless. He simply refines, adapts, and keeps learning about the pirate, the pirate's methods, and the pirate's victims.All of Hall's sleuthing has legal and political backdrops. The legal backdrop involves figuring out what the charges are, how to get the cuffs on a Chinese software pirate, and how to make sure he can prove those charges to his boss, different agencies, and eventually to a jury if required. As for the politics, Hall reveals that running a piracy investigation is full of political obstacles because there is only so much time and money available and the outcome is uncertain. It seems that US attorneys tend to shun risky investigations. Oh - risky doesn't mean getting shot at or anything, it means that there are easier to prove cases that are better for the office's performance metrics.Hall works largely with Homeland Security (HSI) officers. This is new(ish) because the FBI used to be the go-to guys. The book is a nice introduction to who and what HSI is.I could go on forever. I loved this book. I read it in a single long sitting over labor day weekend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M9WY1U2VRJ0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393249549#wasThisHelpful","R2M9WY1U2VRJ0K","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This helmet works well and at a great price point. Highly recommended.But... I often write how I would improve a product, here goes. Firstly, I'd  put in a button that makes the helmet dark regardless of what the sensors say. Second, I'd paint it white.As tested, I got little use out of the sensitivity setting setting. I just left it turned all the way up and indoors it never triggered offf of anything, other than an arc. At the highest sensitivity, it sometimes triggered off the sun. Yes, I did try looking directly at the sun but I had to keep my eyes closed most of the time and I could not predict when the lens would darken. I also experimented with it off my head and the sun didn't reliably trigger it.The black plastic get pretty dang hot in the August sun. That's why I'd paint it white.All that said, this is a great helmet. It does its job and there are lots of adjustments to make it fit perfect. I've only worn it a few hours but in that time had no hot spots. All the adjustments are obvious and easy - except the eyeball-to-glass distance that I didn't know was in there until I read the directions - and I still haven't messed with that adjustment, The distance is fine even with my eyeglasses.There's plenty of airflow too. No fogging.

"These are perfectly good medium duty trash bags. I compared them to kirkland kitchen bags, cheap 30ish gallon bags for outdoor bins, and my outdoor ""contractor"" bags.It isn't really fair to put these bags head-to-head against the contractor bags. Those bags are much thicker. The thicker bags are better at everything except expense. So, enough of that.Compared to the drawstring kitchen bags, the hefty steelsak is a bit thicker.First test - shoving in a finger until it pokes through. Both bags deformed about the same before bursting but the steelsak put up about twice the resistance. So, the steelsak will hold up better to sticks and stuff but will give way eventually.Second test - slashing with a knife. Surprisingly, both bags seemed the same. Similar slashing attempts either didn't cut through either or did cut through both. Once pierced, both bags had similar resistance to making the cut longer. I was impressed by both bags.Third test - knife slash against a cutting board. This test was mostly due to disbelief that the earlier slash test hadn't made long easy cuts. Similar results from both the kitchen bags and the steelsaks.Next came the cheap-sack. The cheap ones failed quickly. The didn't give much before getting finger-holed. The knife slashed through easily.Summary - the steelsaks and those kirkland kitchen bags are surprisingly good in comparison to those cheap bags I had sitting around. If I'm carrying trash in my car, I'm going to use those contractor bags -or- the steelsaks. I don't want a mess in my car. For yard waste, I'll compost. Also, if I were carrying bags of stuff any distance, like apartment dwellers would, I'd use a bag that probably won't burst or leak..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R133JX4AU6TN2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RNCZWQ#wasThisHelpful","R133JX4AU6TN2Q","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an experienced multi-copter hobbyist and I'm impressed with this book. To be a bit more specific, I've owned numerous micro-quads, a Parrot AR drone 2.0, and have built a few 'copters too. I still learned a lot from this book. The only ""constructive criticism"" I can offer is that the book does not cover micro-copters like my favorites - the Blade Nano QX and its FPV (first person view) version, the Blade Nano QX FPV. These micro-copters are great for flying indoors and through the house. The book recommends against indoor flying. It's true that craft like the Parrot AR drone are hard to fly indoors - the prop wash makes for a very turbulent hallway, etc. But... micro-quads are great indoors and allow for quick flights every day without hassle.Over all, the book seems to suggest the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 or the DJI Phantom with GoPro. These are great choices for ready to fly quads. The book also covers care and fixing by pointing out that the devices should be inspected before and after each flight and even gives examples of pre-flight and post-flight checklists. Other kinds of flying craft are mentioned, such as fixed wing drones, but the book is really about multi-copters. The book does not really cover the repair budget. A new pilot should plan on spending at least half the price of the drone in first year repairs. In the case of a non-FPV micro-quad, they're cheap, plan to destroy a few. Also, the book doesn't mention that the manufacturers forums and online videos should be checked for ""required"" modifications. For example, the Parrot's landing gear really are fragile and that zip-tie modification is indispensable.There is a fair amount of text dedicated to not annoying others (being a ""bonehead"" - rhymes with drone head) and knowing and obeying the law. These are important issues. As for how current the book is, it discusses the FAA's proposed rules that issued in February 2015. So, that's great. Multi-copter technology has been evolving at an amazing pace over the past few years. It would appear that this book will become dated quickly, but there are big sections that will hold up well for at least a few years. For example, the proper ways to deal with batteries is unlikely to change. Nor will the parts on planning video shoots, taking care of the equipment, checklists, ...The parts that I found most eye opening and instructive had to do with cameras, video, and connecting socially with like minded pilots. Regarding cameras, the reasons for using a GoPro are well argued although I'm more of a mobius guy because my machines wreck gloriously and often. People more concerned with getting usable video and not crashing would probably prefer the GoPro. The book also covers way better cameras that can be used for taking great video but cost way more, weigh a lot more, and are for people with advanced budgets.On the subject of video, the tools for editing are listed and described. Most interestingly the book introduces some tools for removing camera jitter such as Youtube and Turbo Video Stabilizer for cheap and Adobe After Effects for not so cheap. The steps for getting that video out of a 'copter and into a computer are described, including getting video and images into a chromebook. Also, new to me, the Pixlr chromebook app can edit images. Interesting because the ""Baseflight"" chromebook app is a nice ground station and configuration tool for certain quad copter flight controllers.Another great section is the one covering using social media to meet other 'copter addicts. These are by far the most important resources for finding out how to deal with the problems that absolutely will crop up. Things like why your quad is flipping over instead of taking off. Also, the author mentions the glory of Youtube. I've spent untold hours watching 'copter how-to videos on Youtube. The book details using google groups, facebook, and manufacturers web sites to ask questions and connect with people - including observations that many of these forums are moderated and abusive/stupid posts won't stay online.To sum it up, this book is well done, timely, readable, and more informative than I could have ever dreamed of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R147MA1VQSUVDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119049784#wasThisHelpful","R147MA1VQSUVDY","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an economical nailer that is great for light work. It's construction quality is good, it's robust, and it does its job. This isn't the tool for laying flooring or putting in molding day after day. It's perfectly fine for remodeling the occasional room, assembling picture frames, hobby projects, that sort of thing.Notes: max PSI: 120 but I used 30-40 PSI to drive 5/8"" - 1.5"" brads.Oil: a drop into air connector, I used car engine oil because I had some at hand.Brads: 18 gauge, I used different lengths of the Hitachi ones from the big box store a mile away.First off - there's the issue of the manual and directions. They hardly exist and they aren't easy to find. I did not find them and I did google for them and did go to Arrow's the product page. This annoyed the heck out of me.The unit does require the occasional drop of oil and there will be an occasional very very light mist of oil that comes out with a nail. This is not a huge deal unless too much oil is put in. I put two drops of oil into the unit. This is where those instructions would be so useful for someone that's new to pneumatic nailers. How much oil (a drop now and then) and where to put it (right into the hole in the air connection).I tested this tool using Hitachi 18 gauge brads of various lengths and drove them into an old pine 2x6. The only way I found to adjust depth was by setting the pressure at the regulator. This can be a serious pain. It's easiest to start at low pressure and then move to higher pressures so that you don't have to bleed the air pressure out of the hose during between adjustments. It's almost impossible to set the depth to flush with the wood surface, but that really doesn't matter for most applications.You have to put the nailer into position and pull the trigger. You can't just pull the trigger and then bump along the work piece, driving a brad with each bump. Also, the cycle time is slow - probably because of the low pressure in the air hose.In summary, this tool will do the job but is best for small jobs. The better tools cost about three or four times as much, don't need oil, have depth adjustments, a faster cycle time, and can be bumped down the work piece.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XY6O7KAUVEJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXDPZ3K#wasThisHelpful","R2XY6O7KAUVEJO","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five stars because -other- people love it. I personally was shocked at how aromatic this body wash is. The entire bathroom was filled with a strong ""mandarin and tiare flower"" scent. It is not a manly scent and I was concerned that I would be carrying that scent for the rest of the day. I think the scent largely washed off because no one commented on it and I even asked a couple trusted advisers if I smelled perfumed.Other people, people without a Y chromosome, have review this body wash as follows: ""It's nice <smile>"".As for the body wash itself, it lathered up nicely, rinsed off, and definitely moisturized. It's not that big a deal for me in the summer (as I write this) but I do dry out during the winter. I'll see if dove has a less scented body wash.A note on body washes - I use them exclusively at home and keep the bathrooms stocked with them because bar soap builds up on the shower walls.

"This review is for the Belkin Conserve Insight Energy Use Monitor (F7C005). I gave five stars because it works well doing what it promises to do. It measures the power being consumed by a device, keeps a record, and will even calculate cost. Pretty simple stuff. There are lots of times that I've wanted this exact functionality.But... I ran into a problem because I'm adding brains to my house. What I really wanted is the Belkin WeMo F7C029fc because it can communicate with my Echo and because it lets me switch the power on and off. Note to Belkin folks - I'd really like a WeMo power monitor that absolutely can never switch off the power. I don't mean a selection or a checkbox ""disable switch"" option. I mean no dang switch at all. Just a power monitor and nothing more.Anyways, I tried this device out in a number of locations. It is currently monitoring my refrigerator because I do not want to be able to remotely turn off the fridge. The monitor is likely to remain there for a long time because it is a pain to get access to that outlet behind the fridge.To summarize, this is a great little monitor and it is really useful for checking out what kind of power is being pulled by different devices.

No damage from that.This two sided foam tape is better for this use than regular two sided tape because the foam gives way a little where surfaces aren't perfectly flat.I didn't use hook & loop, like velcro, because velcro lets the control board move around too much which confuses the gyros.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148E8H821CZC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00347A8GC#wasThisHelpful","R148E8H821CZC9","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting gadget that I've been slowly using more and more. The key seems to be my own laziness.After the initial play time (""Alexa, what's phrenology?"") Echo sat there ignored. Then I wanted to know the time without shifting my lazy butt. (""Alexa, what time is it?""). Later it was ""alexa, how's the weather."" Then it was ""Alexa, set an alarm for..."".Basically, I've been asking Alexa for stuff when I don't feel like reaching for a phone/tablet, lifting a finger, or even looking over at a clock.So, far, so good. The more I ask, the more it does. Maybe I'll even buy some devices for it to control.The phone app is pretty good. Also pretty amusing.

"It's an odd little device. It -does not- look like the fire tv remote in that the echo remote doesn't have buttons under the round thing.It does work. Lack of a speaker makes it weird because you talk to it and then hear the echo talking back from the other room.Other than that, it's like talking to the echo.On the fire remote is for moving around in menus and stuff.

"This is the brightest flashlight I, or anyone I know, has ever seen. A few years ago I started using a StreamLight tactical flashlight because it lights up the night way better than the normal LED flashlights I have sitting all over the place.This flashlight makes my tactical flashlight look like a candle. It lights up my hallway better than the ceiling lights. The dog absolutely can’t hide in the backyard at night because this flashlight is too good.The heart(s) of the flashlight are some Cree high brightness LEDs and two of the most amazing rechargeable batteries. I fly electric quadcopters and am careful to get great batteries. The flashlight batteries are lighter and with higher capacity than any of my quadcopter batteries.For testing, I filled a bin with water - about two feet deep. I turned on the flashlight, tossed it in the bin, and walked away when nothing exploded or shorted out. I monitored it with an action cam set to take a time lapse video. The flashlight stayed lit for 40 hours, 6 minutes. It was immersed the whole time. I’m not kidding. It was that long. Maybe the battery’s newness made some magic. Also, the flashlight has three continuous light settings and one strobe setting. The test was at the lowest continuous setting - which is still pretty darn bright.Next test was the same but with the flashlight at its brightest. It lasted 2 hours, 8 minutes after  full recharge. It was immersed the whole time.No I don’t have the recharge times. Also, no water ever made its way into the flashlight.If there’s anything negative about this flashlight, it’s that it takes some fussing to screw the end back on after the recharging/reinstalling the batteries. It takes a bit to get the threads lined up or something, but isn’t exactly a big deal. Maybe its all the O-rings. I think there are three O-rings sitting in three grooves. The flashlight comes with some spare O-rings that haven’t been needed yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CX0EIX62457S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ4KCUG#wasThisHelpful","R1CX0EIX62457S","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a love hate relationship with the Cuisinart brand. Many of their products are outstanding but others are just sort of “meh” and not worth the extra paid for the label. This machine is astonishing. I like it almost as much as my Cuisinart immersion blender that has seen almost daily use for at least five years. This machine is so capable that it might see a similar level of use.First impression - this thing is huge and the base is heavy. It dwarfs my “normal” food processor. The first thing I tried was … hummus. Hummus is not a challenge to any food processor. The motor spun with authority and the chickpeas and stuff turned into hummus in the 4.5 cup work bowl. No surprises, normal clean-up.Regarding the accessory case - at first I was annoyed by the accessory case because I really like to keep my counters clear. The accessory case seemed like just more counter clutter. In like the accessory case now because it actually saves me some space and danger. It saves me some danger because my old food processor blades are loose in a drawer and they’re sharp and they’re oddly shaped. Now that I think about it, I’m lucky no house guest has been cut rummaging in that drawer. The accessory case now lives in a cupboard where the old food processor used to be.Next up was bread using a recipe from the booklet that came with the machine. Yes, this machine kneads bread. However… I also have a nice KitchenAid mixer with bread hooks. Based on the clean-up, I’ll probably use the mixer when only making bread and the food processor for more involved projects. Such as…Chicken pot pie, again using the recipe from the Cuisinart booklet. This is a fun recipe because the outcome is tasty and because it engages more aspects of the machine because it calls for the buttermilk biscuits in a different recipe. The machine simply worked. Cleanup was as expected. Food was great.The chopping blade is really cool because it is adjustable. This is really nice for fried zucchini because I’ve never been happy with the slice thicknesses the the old food processor could make with its non-adjustable blades. Very nice - one adjustable device replacing a few others.None of my tests had put any stress on this beastly machine so I decided to use it to make venison burger out of a “roast” that needed eaten. The ingredients were large chunks of mostly thawed venison and large chunks of mostly thawed pork fat (yes, I’m a dietary philistine). This is a tough task, but this Cuisinart machine did the job in a very workmanlike manner and in way less than a minute.The summary is that this is an amazing and beastly food processor. It is a vast improvement over any other food processor that I've ever used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRV6A31KGYDQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLX6M5M#wasThisHelpful","RRV6A31KGYDQE","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thermometer meets expectations without drama. Most of all, it has the temperature guide printed inside the dial is great. Sure, I have a temperature guide stuck to the fridge, but this puts the information I need where I need it. The silicone dial backing is a thin piece of silicone that is surprisingly nice. This style of meat thermometer tends to get a hot dial because the housing is all metal. That little silicone covering probably saved me from grabbing hot metal.All that said, and as other reviewers have noted, it ain't perfect.No, it isn't super easy to read. It isn't hard to read either. I had to think for a few seconds because the dial could be more intuitive. Such is life.The description incorrectly says that this device gives quick readings. Could be quicker. If the meat chunk is big enough, I'll leave the thermometer stuck in it.As for build quality, who knows. I doubt Cuisinart built a factory for these devices and suspect that they went to one of the many manufacturers and asked ""how much to get our branding inside that dial?""Then there's the sleeve. Actually, a tube with a metal clip. I guess it's for protecting the probe from other stuff in the drawer this thing lives in. I'm not sure why, but what the heck. Maybe it solves a problem other people have.  I'll try not to lose the tube.All in all, this is a meat thermometer that, functionally, is like just about every other meat thermometer. I like it because it has that temperature guide right there inside, a silicone thing that helps keep me from burning my fingers, and that sleeve. Hmmm, that sleeve. dunno about that sleeve yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7GRRF59NNZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B58A1NC#wasThisHelpful","R3R7GRRF59NNZI","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are no spoilers in this review because anything specific in the review happens within the first few chapters -or- is intentionally obfuscated. This is a really fun book to read. I read it in three sittings (I read slowly) and would have read it in one if I’d indulged myself.This is an odd story with the Jedi order flirting with edge of darkness and the human toll that they pay.The main characters are Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos. What’s great is that this book does so much to develop the characters. Vos is so very much a Jedi and he’s tasked with a very un-Jedi mission that has him twisting and turning to justify his actions. Ventress is … Ventress. Many of us are familiar with her from the “Clone Wars” series. We kind of know her back story, but we don’t know her. This book brings her into focus.There is plenty of action and the story has a very Star Wars feel. You can almost hear the voices and see the action with the blaster bolts flying and the narrow escapes. Actually, something that was a little … different was the battle droids saying “roger” instead of “roger roger.” For some reason, I always imagine them saying “roger roger.” As further credit to the author, even the battle droids come to life with their silly reactions and statements.All-in-all, this is a very good Star Wars story and would be very good on screen. But… there are things you can only get from a book and that’s what makes this book worth reading. Books are better at putting the reader in the characters’ heads. You get a better sense of what is bothering Obi-Wan about Vos’ mission and the way things are playing out. Heck, you even get a better understanding of how Dooku twists people around like he did with Ventress when she was his apprentice.After finishing this book I rewatched Dooku lose his head in Revenge of the Sith. Very satisfying. I also hope the Night Sisters have a come back. They seem not-so-bad now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4SM2N5FOE65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511530#wasThisHelpful","R2F4SM2N5FOE65","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is busily danging a projector from my ceiling. I installed this thing about 6 months ago and then forgot it. That's a good thing because it means the mount has been doing its job and not giving me hassle.There are lots of pieces and it's a good idea to follow the instructions. This is especially so for the bottom part that attaches to the projector. All the pieces I needed for hanging a projector off the ceiling were included.There are lots of rotating and angling about adjustments that make it easy to aim the projector at whatever is being used as a screen. That said, you want to mount everything square anyway to avoid tombstoning the view.

In the past, the 3D aspects were kind of in your face and took you out of the action. In this movie, the 3D adds to the action and becomes a part of the story.As for the story - there are lots of reviews breathlessly recapping the story line. No need to waste my time typing in yet another plot review.The story is impressive though. The broad strokes being the time shifting alien race that is unstoppable and one man ending up as the counter.

"I bought this so I could get used to flying the nano qx before flying the nano qx FPV. This little quad is amazingly well engineered.Regarding the prop guards - those little bits of plastic that look like silly attempts at guarding the prop. They work. They work very well. The only issue with them is that they can snag things that the quad runs into. Really not a big deal.It was a little bit of a hassle to pair this with the transmitter that came with the nano qx fpv. It was even more of a hassle to pair that transmitter back with the nan qx fpv. I upgraded the transmitter to a Taranis X9D and all those problems are a thing of the past. Pairing is fast and easy. Also, the nano qx seems to fly a lot more smoothly and predictable with the Taranis X9D.As for flying this little quad. It is pure joy. It is very responsive while being easy to control. I fly it indoors a lot and try racing it under tables, through chairs, over ceiling fans, etc. Lots of wrecks because I am trying to go fast but it is amazing how easy it is to bring this thing back to a hover.It's hard to say what the range is because the range depends more on the transmitter and I have upgraded to a pretty good one.

"Great strap for its price. This is definitely an economy model.First off, it works exactly as it is supposed to. The pick pocket is OK while playing but doesn't retain picks when the guitar is being carried and the strap is just hanging. In other words - don't trust it to hold spare picks between sessions.The strap material is sturdy and the buckles seem rugged enough. The ends fit onto the guitar without drama and have stayed on reliably.Returning to that strap material, it is nylon webbing and it is some serious strong stuff. However... it being summer I'm often playing without a shirt. I have other straps that are a lot more comfortable for shirtless playing. Not that this one bothers me.

"Very light, good power. Corded is great because the battery powered ones run out of juice, batteries are heavy,  and that battery is going to give out in a year or two.My gas mower wouldn't start. I chose to buy this one instead of dealing with getting the gas one fixed. I may have saved money.I grew up using an electric mower, so it doesn't seem odd at all to trail a cord and avoid running over it. The mower itself is really light. I mow some areas with a one handed back and forth motion as if I were vacuuming a rug.The lawn had gotten rather long and ratty with the gas mower broken. This mower had to wade through grass that was 10"" high in places. It did fine. There were a places where it bogged down and even stopped the mower blade. No problem. Back out and ease in and the blade did its job.If I were to change anything, I'd get rid of the the wheel height linkages. I'm capable of setting all four wheels individually. The linkages make it easier but are a pain to clean around. That's the other change - make it easier to sweep the mower clean with a bench brush.

"It arrived as a well set up and ready to play instrument. Just a bit of tuning required. It has held its tune for the month or so I've had it even though the weather (humidity and temp) have been all over the place. I did replace the strings, mostly to try out the other strings.Confession - I mostly bought this to play the bass tracks in rocksmith. Getting a five string was a mistake because everything bass in rocksmith is for a four string. Such is life. I held the B string at the fifth fret to tune using the rocksmith tuner. Since then, that string is all but ignored.As for quality - this thing is great. I think it is difficult to get a crappy instrument from a brand manufacturer these days. The build quality is good, the fit and finish are good, the fretboard is flat. There are no weird buzzes or thunks that aren't my fault.The stock strings are fine and would still be one the bass -except- that I had some Elixers that I wanted to try. The Elixers are smoother, a bit easier to play, and have less finger noise than the stock strings. I guess that the Elixer strings are an upgrade and I'm glad I put them on. That said, I'd be perfectly happy with the stock strings if they were still on there.The tuners are fine. I was worried at first that they would have backlash or something because this bass is so inexpensive. Nope. No backlash.I doubt I'll be upgrading this bass within the next few years. There are more expensive one out there, but this one does the job perfectly well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DFJDZRDISDWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWVBAZI#wasThisHelpful","R3DFJDZRDISDWX","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Super versatile. This is a great pedal for anyone trying to figure out what pedals are for because it can do an amazing number of different things. Also, at its price, there really is little fear of messing it up. If you break it, get another. When I got it I spent hours playing with the settings and probably had a huge grin the whole time.At first, I was disappointed with the instructions. The fact is, this is a pedal. Plug in and play. Then play around some more. Then take a break and watch some of the videos online with guys playing with pedals. Most of all, just play around and see what you like. The thing about the instructions is that you can write books about setting up pedals and even then a book can't pick a string or finger a fret. Plugging in is the only way to really learn. Just keep in mind that this is an inexpensive little pedal and not an effects cabinet. Keep it simple, be happy.I bought this thing so that I could easily switch to e flat tuning from e standard. I think I had it worked out but didn't write it down and then messed it up and haven't tried again. I should have set it and the dripped on some wax or hot glue or something to lock the knobs in place. For now, it's easier to just tune the guitar. Maybe with practice it'll be easier to set up the pedal than tune the guitar. Maybe I'll use something else that specializes in pitch shifting. Someday.Other reviewer's have commented on the plastic body and said it seemed fragile. It survived the heel of a boot from a 180lb man.Other reviewers complained about noise. Mine seemed noisy at first but I think I was jacked into it weird. No problems after the first few minutes.That LED that says the pedal is on - it is bright as hell.Someone said the thing doesn't have true bypass. That isn't my experience. Maybe that reviewer had it set up different. Who knows.Someone complained about lag. I dunno. Maybe I'm just starting the phrases a little sooner. What I do know about lag comes from playing rocksmith. Rocksmith can have a weird lag when the audio is going through HDMI because some TVs are slow at decoding. There, the sounds goes guitar -> pedal -> rocksmith cable -> PS3 -> (HDMI) -> TV. The biggest lag seems to be at the HDMI step. That's probably why ubisoft suggests using the audio outs and staying analog.In summary, this is a great pedal because it can do so very many different things and gives you a feel for what you really want. Then, once you know what you want, keep a few of these around because they are so versatile. Frankly, I think I'll have at least one of these pedals sitting around or in use for the next few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6XHPVYKTO72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016MJ1T2#wasThisHelpful","R3H6XHPVYKTO72","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you want pure utility with big pockets, then this ain't for you.Usually, I'd end the review with how I'd change the product to improve it for my uses. The only things I can think of is that there are other materials that are more stain resistant. Those materials would make for a far more expensive garment though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTE32FJAHYCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4IYI3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3RTE32FJAHYCG","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are some nice bass strings. I used them to replace the original strings that came on a nearly new fender squire bass. The Elixir strings are certainly better. They are smoother and faster and a nice little upgrade.I recently reviewed the stainless steel Elixir bass strings. Here, repeated, is what I wrote about the nanoweb: The folks behind these strings are the same as those behind those gore-tex fabrics and that the slick PTFE dental floss (Glide?). The nanoweb is probably similar technology. That means that these strings will probably stay smooth a long time and shouldn't get crusty or anything as easily. They should also be easier to clean because of that coating.So, nickel or stainless? There is lots of discussion and disagreement about what is better – stainless or nickel plated. For me, the best strings are the ones I have on hand. I play what I have and am not that particular. When buying Elixir strings with nanoweb, I'll reach for the stainless ones because I rarely play straight into an amp and, even then, the amp has adjustable filters. It’s easier to mix the pluckier stainless to make it sound like the warmer nickel than it is to make nickel sound like stainless. Also, the nanoweb does a lot of what the nickel plating is for. The nanoweb makes the strings smooth and fast and also helps keep them from getting rusty and crusty. In other words, I think the nanoweb takes the place of the nickel plating without also smoothing out the sound as much.Regardless of all that, these are very good strings. They will probably stay on that bass for at least a year. They will probably get replaced with stainless Elixir strings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WF8CZND2UFHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU6JD6#wasThisHelpful","R1WF8CZND2UFHL","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazingly, this thing works. Who would’ve thunk that a hole in the bottom and a little stopper thing would work so well? This thing actually exceeds expectations.OK, wonderment aside, this makes sense. Chemists have used separation columns for centuries. Brewers have special vats with angled bottoms leading to a valve. This separator does the same thing but without the industrial niceties.Other than just working, the other niceties are the mesh at the top for catching the chunk and the baster. The baster brush is great because it works and is silicone and I love silicone kitchen gadgetry. The baster’s “shower” attachment is good because it provides good coverage, is faster to use than the baster brush, and doesn’t contact whatever is being basted.If I were to improve it… I’d make it easier to clean, I’d adapt the bottom to have at least a few degrees of slope toward the hole, and the hole plug would have a better plugging material (silicone?).Regardless, this thing works and gets five stars for doing its job without drama or weirdness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKV5N27AHIRJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG6FQCI#wasThisHelpful","RKV5N27AHIRJA","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the other vine reviewers, I received the “T4U” instead of the “T4UH’ – in other words, I got the USB stick instead of the version with the fold out antennas. Normally I’d be pis<dle><del><del> nonplussed, but I didn’t actually pay for this review sample. As such, I’ll just review what I got.So – why would anyone even buy a WiFi dongle these days when just about everything comes with internal WiFi?Firstly – there’s that desktop with a wire running to it. It would be nice to move that thing without running a new wire.Secondly – range. This dongle has pretty good range when coupled with some wariness. It comes with a USB 3 cable which is great because the dongle can be placed up high to get better signal and range. That said, this dongle is big enough that most people won’t want to plug it straight into their computer. My personal plan for this dongle it to stick it high on a boat mast to better reach lake shore WiFi access. Note: this involves shrink wrap to protect the connection between USB 3 cable and dongle.Third – speed. This thing is fast. It’s way faster than most internal WiFi, at least for now.Over all, this WiFi dongle does its job well and completely meets expectations. Five stars for that. However… if I had to buy such a device I’d get one that connects via a CAT6 network cable instead of USB 3. There are trade-offs. CAT6 means (most likely) a wall wart and power cords but should have setup via a browser. Setup via a browser is a big plus for me. Meanwhile, this USB 3 device doesn’t require external power. As for which is more secure – who knows.Finally, I’ve been really happy with TP-Link devices lately. They seem more engineering oriented whereas Linksys and Netgear seem to have become marketing centric. Hopefully TP-Link stays the course.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBGBZG15SKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQD235C#wasThisHelpful","R3TBGBZG15SKG","AI8EMB0HUC6Z5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8EMB0HUC6Z5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review -Jungle of Snakes – James Arnold“Jungle of Snakes: A Century of Counterinsurgency Warfare from the Phllippines to Iraq” by James Arnold is a well written commentary on four insurgencies:  The Philippines by USA 1898-1904,  Algeria by the French 1950's, Malaysia by the British 1950's and Vietnam again by the USA 1960's.  The author states in the “Acknowledgments”  that his book grew out of discussions “about relevant military history about America's ongoing counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.”  To this end the four insurrections are evaluated in terms of security, local conditions, preparations by the invading country, commitment, weapons, language, home support, capacity to recruit insurgents, pacification and country rebuilding techniques, goals of the conquerers, and information and communications, use of torture, and cohesion of the aims and methods of the conquerers.  It becomes obvious midway through the book, and frankly stated in the Vietnam section that the author comes down squarely with Gen Petraus and against Gen Westmoreland in the long standing disagreement about the roles of the army and other US military in any insurgency and counterinsurgency.In the Vietnam section and the conclusions section, the author makes frequent reference to the 1940 “Small Wars Manual” of the US Marine Corp and decries that its lessons had to be relearned from scratch as it had been forgotten.The book is well written, an entertaining read, informative as to neglected facts of the four insurgencies, and clear in its arguments as to why Gen Petraus was right.  There are few diagrams, and no pictures, but these would have been superfluous.I am left with the suspicion that the histories are told selectively to make the author's points.  Many points are made by focusing in on examples of pacification attempts and anecdotal evidence.I strongly recommend this book to students of counterinsurgency history as its points are well made and well taken.  But an eye needs to be kept out for prejudgements and selective history telling.  The arguments as to the tactics and strategy, i.e. the purpose and uses of the armies,  to achieve the goals of the conquering nations need to be understood and kept in mind as this book is read.FYI there are minimal references to Iraq and Afghanistan in spite of the reference made in the “Acknowledgments,” that this book is to prepare the reader to understand military history that applies to both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VTVKX0VEV158/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WOD8W4#wasThisHelpful","R1VTVKX0VEV158","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Learn to Play Go:  A Master's Guide to the Ultimate Game”This book is the first volume to a 5 volume set by Janice Kim and Jeong Soo-hyun, both masters of the game.  It is written as an introduction to the game and is intended to enable a player to play at the most basic levels of the game Go.  It succeeds very well.  I do not feel ready to go out and play tournaments, but I could play simple games.The Game of Go has very simple rules.  But the strategy and tactics are extremely complicated.  While computers can beat the world champion chess players, they can only play the very elementary levels of Go.The book has been carefully formatted with very many board examples of the game.  The writing is clear and easy to understand.  The levels of complexity have been kept to a minimum, with more to come in the remaining four volumes of the series.  And while deep study is needed to master the game, this book enables the English speaking American to at least start to play.After reviewing several other books on Go, I decided to try this series by Janice Kim.  I am glad I chose Kim's books.  This is an excellent introduction to the Game of Go.  I look forward to reading and working my way through the rest of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWU8MEG4E1HU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1453632891#wasThisHelpful","RWU8MEG4E1HU0","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review The Phoenicians“The Phoenicians” from Charles River Editors is a good, but brief review of what little is know about the culture we know as Phoenicians.  They did not leave much in the way of writings or cities or other artifacts.  In spite of their basic first use of a phonetic alphabet, not much is known about them other than the writings in the Egyptian and Greek material.  Their precise origin is unknown.  They seem to be related to the Canaanites and the ancient Hebrews, at least by language.  They traveled and traded widely, establishing colonies cross the entire Mediterranean World.  Their colonies were especially on the west end of the Mediterranean Sea.  Carthage was one of their early colonies, but soon became more or less it's own city.They interacted with the Egyptians and the Babylonians and the Greeks.  In fact the name we use for them is Greek, and not their own.  The Sea People did not seem to bother them much, in spite of wreaking havoc  all around them.  The Phoenician Culture mostly disappeared after Alexander the Great defeated them.The book is brief, but well written.  It is easily read in under two hours.  Like most of the Charles River Editor books, it only claims to be a brief introduction to the culture. In that it succeeds very well.For some looking for a quick overview of the Phoenician History, this is quite good.  And I am not sure how much more is actually known.  More is known of Carthage, but even there our modern knowledge is sketchy.  Off one star for its brevity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OOO6NYDR22SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNE70R8#wasThisHelpful","R3OOO6NYDR22SX","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review Metabolic Conditioning: Rapid Fat Loss and Enhanced Athletic Performance Using Metabolic Training Techniques (Metabolic Conditioning and Rapid Weight Loss Book 1) [Kindle Edition]Jason Rook (Author)“Metabolic Conditioning” by Jason Rook is a small book that well and competently explains the High Intensity Training technique.  Jason starts with the three basic energy production systems in the body.  With these Jason ventures into examples of the various exercises that challenge each.  Then Jason develops an approach to using these in exercise to both lose weight and to gain in athletic performance.  Ending with demonstrations of the tabata technique and basic instructions in how to apply tabata, Jason ends the book with sample workouts.  The intent of the book is for the reader to develop his/her own workouts based on the principles presented.  The book will make an individual able to develop workouts in line with the principles.The book is not technical, or medical, but very practical in its approach. Jargon is avoided. However,  this is not a book for the beginner exerciser, as one must know and understand the exercise repertoire to follow the book and to insert a variety of exercises into the principles.For an fitness buff, this is an easy approach to a very complicated topic all too often presented with all the details and jargon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NJH25P729PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P16OIOW#wasThisHelpful","R6NJH25P729PS","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Planet of the Bugs by Scott Richard Shaw“Planet of the Bugs” is the story of the evolution of insects from the first one celled creatures to the modern era.  The sweep is vast.  The story is excitingly told.  Scattered throughout are pictures of fossilized insects.The writing style is clear and easily read.  The Kindle version is well formatted.  The viewpoint is very pro-bug.  The actual text is only 60% of the book.  The remainder of the book is the notes.Dr. Shaw claims along with several other entomologists, who Dr.Shaw quotes, that this is really a planet on which the insects have been  far more successful in terms of number of species, genii, orders, in terms of sheer mass and sheer numbers, than any other living organism on Earth.  Dr. Shaw clearly shows us how the insects have survived through two of Earth's five major extinctions.  And he discusses that the insect will most likely survive the 6th Extinction as long as it is not too drastic.  Thus, if we were not so biased, we should call Earth, the Planet of the Bugs.Dr. Shaw freely and with familarity discusses the pressures that drive evolution.  It is Dr. Shaw's intent to demonstrate how the pressures of the climate and changes in the climate have driven the changes in the insects that have occurred over the last 250 million years.Dr. Shaw also chides us on ignoring the already underway 6th Extinction, the Extinction of Biodiversity.  He mentions global warming, but feels that the loss of life's multitudinous forms is the real 6th Extinction.The only drawback to this book is the necessary use of technical terms  They are all well explained in the text.  The thus named concepts are all necessary to understand the evolution of the insects.  And without dumbing down an excellent book, could not have been avoided.For anyone with  more than a passing interest in insects and the modes of evolution, this is an excellent book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YAZ75N880F9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJW7RJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2YAZ75N880F9H","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review – Seven Things You Must Know Before You Leave Your House With Your GunThis is an excellent little book.  It is not the definitive text on concealed carry, but an excellent refresher for the individual who is carrying a weapon concealed, legally.  It is from the people at Concealed Carry Magazine, including Patrick Kilchermann of the Concealed Carry Association.Covered in quite some detail are 1) the mindset of the individual who is carrying.  It is not “when can I shoot?”  but “When must I shoot?”  2)  Retention devices on the holster.  3)  The ten second rule of dying.  4)  live fire drills  5)  one hand out of commission shooting.  Not covered are gun choices and holster choices, although there are some recommendations and state by state law differences.  There is a whole chapter strongly recommending “Self-Defense Shield” insurance, which includes strong language on why it is needed.The book is a compilation of several outstanding authors in the field including Kilcherman, Don Stahlnecker, Kevin Michalowski, sArmando Basulto, Tim Schmidt, and Massad Ayoob.While not a textbook for the individual in the first concealed permit class, this is a useful little book expressing very well several important concepts in the concealed carry world.

"Review – Explosive Calisthenics by Paul Wade“Explosive Calisthenics” by Paul Wade is a tour de force.  This is the same design as Paul Wade's tremendous book, “Convict Conditioning I.”  Paul has chosen 6 calisthenic movements – jumps, power pushups, kip-ups, forward rotations, backward rotations, up and over the bar and lays out excellent progressions to master each of these.  He intends for these to be mastered one at a time, in sequence, each laying the strength, power, and skill to achieve the next.  And yes, these progressions include forward and backward flips and muscle ups.  Along the way through the progressions are many variations of each.Paul lays out the best breakdown of the differences between power and skill training I have ever seen.  Some would say Paul even belabors this point.  But the approach to skill learning (kips, flips, muscle ups) is so different from power learning (pushups, pullups, squats, bridges, leg raises) that this is critical to understand and practice.  Paul carefully explains in good, plain English the facts of skill learning and how it differs from power learning.  He makes the process of skill learning very, very clear.This is a book that any coach, or self teaching athlete, needs to sit down and read clear through, page for page before starting on any activities in the book.  Paul does not give numbers for accomplishing each level as he did in “Convict Conditioning I.”  He lays out the acronym PARC (see book) for recognizing when the athlete is ready for the next step.  This is much more subjective and difficult than getting numbers of reps and sets.  But both the coach and the lone athlete will be able to clearly know when it is time to move up.  Paul also makes suggestions for recognizing when more basic work is needed to move up.  This approach will minimize injury and burnout in the programs.  Paul repeats this concept over and over, and with good reason.  These are dangerous moves in which serious injuries and death have occurred.To begin the activities in this book, Paul states that an athlete should have mastered at least levels 5 or 6 (except handstand pushups) in “Convict Conditioning I.” He will need the power and strength of those levels to safely achieve anything beyond the jumps and the earlier power pushups in this book.  Even with this prerequisite, I suspect it will take most athletes a year or more to progress clear through the progressions in this book.  In my opinion, the athlete should have mastered levels 8 to 10 of the work in “Convict Conditioning I” before beginning the kips and rotational moves in this book.Also included are multiple small space drills for each of the progressions, and wonderful bonus sections that will enrich and improve any man's workouts.While the language is a bit on the rough side, it is nothing beyond what can be expected in a heavily male gym or used by 15+ year olds among themselves.  Gone are the name calling and extremely imaginative vulgarities that marred “C-Mass.”“Explosive Calisthenics” reads well.  The language is clear and explicit in its directions.  The pictures are well done, and illustrative of the skills.  The book is intended to be used.  While beautiful, very well designed and laid out, it is not the coffee table production of some other Dragon Door books.  This book is good enough to buy the paperback.  I feel it is well worth purchasing the actual paperback as opposed to the ebook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209ZKUNOM6SDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0938045830#wasThisHelpful","R209ZKUNOM6SDM","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Kettlebell Long Cycle Training Douglas Seamans Jr.“Kettlebell Long Cycle Training:  A 6 week Progressive Training Program for Long Cycle Competition”  is almost exactly as advertised.  This is guide to doing well at kettlebell long cycle competitions  This is not a book for beginners in Kettlebells or strength conditioning.  Actually this is a 12 week program laid out in detail with lots of hints and suggestions for someone who is quite fit to do well in kettlebell long cycle competitions.  The program is 6 heavy days per week, with three days on the KB and 3 days on general physical preparation, and sport specific preparation and some long slow cardio.Douglas gives us lots of hints at focus, alignment, bounce, fixation, wobble, drift and fast drop.  Douglas outlines his personal warmup for both practice and competition.  Douglas has tips on handling the pre-competition week, the competition day.The instructions for the program are clear and well done.  Douglas has even attached a training schedule for you to print out and mark your progress.  But you are expected to know and be able to perform KB exercises and many other exercises.  Douglas even recommends having a personal coach/ trainer in KB.  Yes, there are many suggestions as to form in the book, but Douglas suggests a KB coach.The first day of the program is 10-15 decline pushups, 5-10 pullups (or reverse rows) finishing with 10 minute run or row OR combat spot such as bag work.  The program goes up appropriately from there for accomplishing as many reps as possible of long cycle kettlebell in ten minutes.  The program is intense as it needs to be.  There is some motivation material included, but also realism as to reality of training at this level.If KB long cycle competitions are your game, this is an excellent guide to preparing for them.Disclaimer:  While I have used KB's in conditioning, I personally have not competed in long cycle competitions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UYRFWVR8MC23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U62LA3I#wasThisHelpful","R3UYRFWVR8MC23","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Average Joe's Guide to Old School Strength & Fat Loss“Average Joe's Guide to Old School Strength & Fat Loss” is a fascinating little book.  By admission of the author Gerry Magree, it contains nothing new.  But it contains a good old fashioned common sense approach to both eating and strength building. The mantra throughout the book is “Eat Clean, Lift Heavy.”The tone of the book is conversational and friendly.  Be warned, the humor is light British. My ebook  copy is well formatted and easily read.  Gerry Magree lays the onus of getting lean and strong on the reader / athlete.  He is giving you a good method to get both, but expects you to lay out effort and time to get lean and strong.About a third of the book is diet information and recipes.  This is not paleo, but common sense eating.  Lots of protein, Put your carbs into the evening.  Avoid beer and pizza and fast food and manufactured food.  Eat “natural.”  It makes sense.  Gerry repeatedly states that you can go off diet, but there will be consequences.The strength portions of the book are based on old principles – squats, pullup ladders, bench presses.  Gerry throws in some barbell curls and a few other exercises, saying “you are going to do these anyway.”  The instructions and pictures are well done, clear giving the reader an appreciation and knowledge for what is expected.Will the experienced athlete / strong man gain much from this book.  No.  But this book is for the “average Joe” off the street, who wanders into a strength gym and wants to get lean and strong.  For that person, this book is right on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ANAWKX6EI11C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLP6JHM#wasThisHelpful","R2ANAWKX6EI11C","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review - Julio Bocca Birdy y otrosAgain, Julio presents a wonderfully danced, imaginative program of ballet.In ""Birdy"" Julio is both a bird and a person captivated by birds.  The dancing is very well done.  The settings and nearly bare stages are imaginative.  Having the ""Eagle"" fly out of a book that opens in the ""fly"" of the stage is amazing.Concertango is a dancing of a concerto with the Julio and a cast of 12.  Imaginative dancing well done, beautiful.The surprise piece is the ""Llanto por la muerte de Ignacio Sanchez Mejias.""  I am sorry that I do not understand Spanish to better understand and explain this piece.  An elder man gives a very dramatic recitative.  Julio dances grief, encouragement, motivation, defiance, appreciation and acceptance to just the human voice of the man reciting this poem.  It is a piece d'art, amazing in itself, even with not knowing what the man is saying.This is the merging of ballet and modern ballet by an imaginative and excellent dancer.  Tall, lanky Julio moves with ease and grace.  His ensemble likewise is talented and dances well.  The emphasis is on the dancing.  Well worth a watch.  Julio has run his dance group in Argentina and can be easily overlooked by those concentrating on the North America, Europe and Russian dancers.  Julio and his group are well worth a look.

"Review – The Natural Method: A Practical Guide of Physical Education Hebert trans Phillippe TilAs near as I can tell, this little book was first published in 1909 in French.  It is directions on establishing a physical education program for male youth 8 – 18.  The original author spent years in the field teaching physical education.  The Method comprises a “Basics” Program of “marching, running, jumping, swimming, climbing, lifting, throwing, and defense.”  A “Preparatory” program consisting of :simple and combined movements of the arms, legs and trunk and normal function of the joints.”  And a “Complementary” portion of “games and sports of all kinds and manual labor.”  There is not much more detail on the exact exercises, movements, games and contests included.The author strongly encourages “air baths” in which the male athlete/student – the primary target of the book – participates shirtless, even in as extreme weather as can be tolerated.  The  all but one or two of the few pictures in the book show large groups of young men without their shirts.There is a score card well described for maintaining records.There is a detailed layout for a small space workout space to include all of the above activities, except running which can be done on roads or trails.The program mentions that manliness also needs education in moral and virility, but leaves those areas to other books.This is a century plus old physical education program with many excellent aspects that could be incorporated into modern schools and teachings.  The goal is a strong, natural athlete and manly men.  As a piece of history this is fascinating.  As examples of practices that have gone the wayside, this is outstanding. The headmaster or teacher would have to spend time setting up the exact detailed programs to be included, and if not skilled in an area, find skilled instructors.The program is very valid, and if instituted intact in 2015 would 1) be a hard sell and 2) again produce manly, virile men.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27P70WHISBIJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSMWRAC#wasThisHelpful","R27P70WHISBIJQ","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – The Ultimate Yogi with Travis EliotThe Ultimate Yogi with Travis Eliot is a fascinating challenge.  Uday Entertainment gives us 12 yoga workouts, two cleansing challenges, and a final of 36, then 72 then 108 sun salutations to cap each of the three segments of the program.The Yoga workouts are good, basic and require strength, stamina and balance.  They are well video taped and the commentary to go along with them is good, and not condescending or fake golf course whispers.  Travis himself moves well, as an  experienced yoga instructor should.  The class of 16 men and women is well photographed doing the workouts.There is both a booklet and a day by day calendar to do the workouts in sequence.  The calender is well and clearly done, telling which workout do to on each of the 108 days.  The booklet is too brief.  Therein lies my problems with this program.The fine print on the back of the box states that this program is not for beginners.  That is fine, but should be much more obviously placed than it is.  If the practitioner is well versed in the poses, asanas, and vinyasas, and has basic strength, stamina, balance and flexibility before he/she starts, then this program will work.  The program is meant for individuals who already have the yoga experience to deal with the poses, asanas and vinyasas.  I did not find instruction in those basic principles in this program.  That is fine, if it is clearly made known in the instructions.Travis does state once - that I found - that the practitioner should do the various programs as far as they can, and work on improving his/her performance and completing each program as indicated over the 108 days.  This was not in a prominent spot in the program or the dvds and it should be.The program is self is good, and if the practitioner is ready with the knowledge and basic abilities in Yoga, then it will benefit the practitioner.  The capstone is the 108 sun salutations in one set.  Nowhere else have I seen this large number of sun salutations as a goal of Yoga practice.  And while it is a challenging goal for advanced Yoga practitioners, is realistic for most individuals?  I am not sure.  And does that accomplishment really mean anything in the Yoga world?  But yes The Ultimate Yoga will enhance a practitioner's strength, stamina, balance and flexibility","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AG0M2DH7M07X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OYK32K#wasThisHelpful","R2AG0M2DH7M07X","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Ashtanga yoga John Scott“Ashtanga Yoga:  The Definitive Step by Step Guide of Dynamic Yoga”  by John Scott is an excellent avenue for the novice to begin Ashtanga Yoga.  John covers Sun Salutations A and B, the Standing Sequence and the Sitting Sequence in good detail.  The instruction is good enough for intermediate students to gain practice form and correct their accumulated errors.The pictures and diagrams are excellent demonstrating the poses very well. The discussion is clear and simply put.  There is an introduction in which John tells of his introduction to Ashtanga Yoga by Derrick Ireland.  There is a discussion of the 8 arms of Ashtanga Yoga.  The Bundha are well described.This book is exactly as the subtitle describes.  Each step of the Sun Salutations A and B is explained and shown in excellent, easy to follow detail.  Each step of the standing series and the sitting series is explained and shown in excellent, easy – if the practitioner has the strength and balance and flexibility – to follow detail.  It is apparent that John believes that one starts with the body one has, and works one's way into the poses over time, i.e months to years,  as strength, balance and flexibility develop.John is obviously an accomplished practitioner of Ashtanga Yoga moving very well in the dvd and artfully in the images of the book.  There is no talking down, or hushed golf course type whispering going on.  This an excellent presentation of an all too often poorly done subject.  Other books of equal strength are those by David Swensen.There is a companion dvd of John Scott doing the Primary Series including the Sun Salutations that is also excellent.  I would recommend getting both the book and the dvd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28H1YS5430GBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0609807862#wasThisHelpful","R28H1YS5430GBX","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Dynamic Strength Training for Athletes – Boyd Epley“Dynamic Strength Training” bears a 1985 copyright.  And it is a true classic of that era.  The author, Boyd Epley, is renown for initiating strength training for university and high school, for founding the National Strength and Conditioning Association, for his outstanding work in training athletes at the University of Nebraska including 10 Heisman Trophy, Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award winners and over 40 All Americans.Boyd wrote this book for the very young athletes (12 - 16 yo)and their families.  Boyd says right up front in the Preface that “This book was written to teach young athletes the correct principles of strength training so they can increase their strength to run faster, jump higher and improve their confidence.”  And with the principles of 1985 does an excellent job.  The pictures are of high school age individuals.  There notes to parents and suggestions for home equipment.  The exercises included are basic and within the reach of 12 – 18 yr olds, Boyd's target audience.  There is a brief, very brief history of strength development and several pages on Boyd's personal journey into strength training.  This material is organized to be both motivational and also to give some proper training tips.The book is well formatted and printed.  The writing is clear and probably about 7-8 grade reading level, again Boyd's target audience.  The programs in the book are excellent and still will work.My only issue is the age of the book.  It looks looks, feels like, reads like and informs like 1985.  The book begs for updating.  Boyd Epley is still alive, semi-retired I understand.  And while there are many books for young athletes these days,  few target this younger audience aiming more at the well developed 16 - 19 yo.  With Boyd's long experience and extensive knowledge he could update this book  into the foremost, most outstanding youth training book available in 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7MSF5HNE44X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0697005917#wasThisHelpful","R7MSF5HNE44X7","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - Body Weight Training Jason Scott""Body Weight Training"" by Jason Scott is a simple little (44 pages) book with a big impact.  Jason takes three basic facts:  1)  To gain mass the lifter must lift more volume  2) when body weight lifting the only two ways to increase difficulty is by increasing reps or changing the angles of the body's levers.  And 3)  good weight lifting programs are very simple.  Jason does go through some other principles of body weight lifting, but these are mostly not related to the central themes of the book.Jason starts with 2 huge, respected body weight lifters,  Gama of India and Mike Tyson of boxing fame.  Jason states both used a very limited number of exercises in gaining their mass and their strength.  Tyson did include other exercises like dips, shrugs, and wrestlers bridges (no weights till after his stint in prison). Gama included lifting odd heavy objects like stones.  Both included some cardio work, and actually training for their sports (wrestling or boxing).Based on the two programs of Gama and Tyson, Jason lays out a challenging, extremely simple ""mass"" program of vertical pulls, vertical pushes and lots and lots of body weight squats.Then Jason wants to add a strength program of L-sits and bar hangsJason likes sprints for cardio and suggests 2 different approaches to sprints.Jason also suggests a brief pulse increasing warmup and a post workout deep stretch program.Thus with basically 5 exercises, Jason says you will add both mass and strength.Are there comparable programs?  When I was doing Wade's ""Convict Conditioning 1,"" I hit 100 of both squats and pushups and was gaining in mass and strength.  I did not do as well on the other 4 of Wades's exercises.  Wade uses 6 exercises, so his program is somewhat similar.  Wade gives progressions for mastering the basic 6.  Jason just jumps in.  Jason's and Wade's programs are quite different.  For the beginner, I would suggest using parts of Wade's to get to the bottom of Jason's.Will it work? Based on Jason's pictures and his discussion of Gama and Tyson, and my brief experience with Wade, it will.  Be sure to take lots time to work up to the work loads.  Hurrying this beyond your own body's abilities will injury you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XC6OADYQ962E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7KWYP4#wasThisHelpful","R1XC6OADYQ962E","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Master the Kettlebell by Max Shank“Master the Kettlebell” by Max Shank is a beautiful, well laid out, well planned, well written book to assist the athlete to use the kettlebell in conditioning.  Max himself is a Master RKC Instructor, and central to Dragon Door's revitalizing of that program.This book is written for the Personal Trainer.  Thus the first chapter is a “First Time Client Assessment.”  This is a simple, but complete assessment of the body of the new client which will give the Personal Trainer a good idea of the issues or lack thereof in the body of a new client.  It starts with the neck, and moves down through the shoulder, checks for impingement, thoracic rotation, checks out the squat and the lunge, looks at the glut bridge, ankle dorsiflexion,  before ending with trunk stability and upper body strength.  Then we got a discussion of the trigger points and their solution.Max includes a total body warmup.  In the warm up, Max includes the turkish getup, the goblet squat stretch and glute bridges.  Even with these the warmup is short enough to be practical.All that before getting to the exercises.  Max spends pages with instructions, pictures (himself and Beth Andrews, Senior RKC and Beast Tamer Challenger Master) warnings, miscues and mistakes and their corrections on the kettlebell swing, the KB get up, the goblet squat, the KB clean, KB presses including the bottom up KB press, KB snatch as the basics.  Then Max moves to the specific exercises,  the windmill, around the world, figure of 8, and juggling.  From here Max moves into the standard gym exercises using the KB.  These are presented in much shorter form.  The Personal Trainer should have a good grasp of these before applying the kettlebells.Max ends with suggestions on building programs and complexes for complete conditioning and athleticism utilizing the Kettlebell and general gym exercises.Max has put together an excellent introduction and advanced training book on using the Kettle bell.  This book is not recommended for the beginner to exercise as it assumes too much basic knowledge of the common gym exercises.  The instructions on the basic KB  moves and their teaching and error corrections are complete and well worth even the most advanced practitioner's and trainer's time.  The instructions on incorporating the kettlebell into general gym exercises are excellent, but requires the user to be familiar with these.Overall, this is an outstanding addition to the Kettlebell Literature and to the literature on general body conditioning and athleticism.The book itself is a piece of art.  If you want an exercise book for your front room coffee table, this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KJ545I0KLB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0938045954#wasThisHelpful","R12KJ545I0KLB0","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review - Weeds of North America by Dickinson and Royer""Weeds of North America"" by Dickinson and Royer is a beautiful color printed, photographic collection of over 500 weeds from the University of Chicago Press.  This is a general guide to the weeds.  If full identification down specie is desired, than the complete and current manuals such as Gray's, Kaul's  or the Great Plains Flora Association's should be consulted.  This book will get the user close.The images are beautiful photographs most often displaying the characteristics of the plants very well.The descriptions are modern, easily read and mostly in simple English.  The few technical terms are easily found in the glossary and diagrams of plant anatomy.  Each plant has scientific name and synonyms,  several common names, a quick id guide, origin, life cycle, where designated a weed, a generous description with bold headings of seed, seedling, leaves, flower, plant appearance and reasons for concern, What is missing is distribution maps.  There is no indication of the spread of the invasive plant other than North America.  This is a serious omission, hopefully to be corrected in future editions. A surprising addition is the listing of the destructive plant viruses that each plant harbors.Included is a key to the plants.  This is keyed to plant type, leaf arrangement, flower color with thumbnail color pictures to help guide for other characteristics.  This key is easily followed even by the amateur plant lover who has only basic knowledge of plant anatomy.  This key is vastly different than the technical keys in the complete manuals such as Gray's, Kaul's,  Rydberg's, The Great Plains Flora Association's, or Britton and Brown's.This book can be compared to the Dept. of Agriculture's ""Common Weeds of the United States"" which is very traditional and scientifically dense in its descriptions, (i.e. no paragraph breaks or headings and many more technical terms),  line drawings, no photographs, and 225 weeds listed.  Both are good in their own way.  Both have 2014 copyright.  Each has its target audience.  The color costs more, but not prohibitively.  Interestingly the sources listed by the books are totally different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R38GXJASBPNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022607644X#wasThisHelpful","R3R38GXJASBPNP","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Common Weeds of the United States – Dept of Ag“Common Weeds of the United States” is a traditional id guide to 224 weeds of the continental United States.  There are no control measures listed, just the id of the weeds.  Chosen for inclusion are weeds that are “prevalent weeds in croplands, grazing lands, noncroplands and aquatic sites.”  The introduction states that this set of weeds was selected by weed scientists largely from the composite list of 1,775 weeds published by the Weed Science Society of America in WEEDS 14: 347-386, 1966.  Thus, if the reader wants to identify down to the species, the reader should further id the weed in more complete manuals.  But this is a good guide to get close.The scientific nomenclature is that of the Weed Science Society of America.  The organization is the traditional evolutionary order of the plant families and then alphabetical by scientific name., genus then specie.  Common names, as listed by the Weed Science Society of America, are listed also.Each weed has two pages.  On one page is a scientific description of the weed.  The introduction states:  “The descriptions are semi technical, with the terminology simplified wherever possible.”  This is true, compared to say, Gray's Manuals.  But the reader will need basic knowledge of the scientific descriptive terms and style of descriptions of botany.  The drawings are drawings.  There are not photographs.  The drawings are good, but of the old botanical drawing school.  Once the reader adjusts to drawings instead of photographs, the drawings are clear and distinct.  The details of the seeds are very good.This is an excellent, traditional guide to common weeds.  Considering the cost of updating this to color photography and printing and the most likely audience of trained professionals, this is a good tradeoff.  For the layman, or common person who idly wants to know what that weed is, this is a little too scientific.Amazon lists another book by the same name and publisher from 1971, so this is an ongoing series of editions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UI7YMER8PY9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160796497X#wasThisHelpful","R1UI7YMER8PY9V","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - Cline, Eric H. (2014-03-23). 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Turning Points in Ancient History) (p. 171). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.""1176BC"" The Year Civilization Collapsed"" is a well written, very readable, detailed analysis of the Late Bronze Age and its collapse in the years 1250 - 1170 BC.  The book starts in approximately 1500B and examines the civilizations extant in the Eastern Mediterranean - Minoans, Mycenaeans, Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Mitannians, Canaanites, Cypriots, and Egyptians - and their complex, active interchange with trade, royal marriages, diplomatic networks, commercial networks, transportation networks, and communication networks.  Many references to both the literature of the time on tablets and to archeological studies reinforce Eric Cline's opinion that Complex Theory and Complexity explain the collapse of the high cultures of the Late Bronze Age and their replacement over the next 300 years by smaller, less complex, but technically more advanced cultures of the Early Iron Age.Eric Cline summarizes the book saying:1177 BC, is a reasonable benchmark and allows us to put a finite date on a rather elusive pivotal moment and the end of an age. We can say with certainty that the far-reaching civilizations that were still flourishing in the Aegean and the ancient Near East in 1225 BC had begun to vanish by 1177 BC and were almost completely gone by 1130 BC. The mighty Bronze Age kingdoms and empires were gradually replaced by smaller city-states during the following Early Iron Age. Consequently, our picture of the Mediterranean and Near Eastern world of 1200 BC is quite different from that of 1100 BC and completely different from that of 1000 BC.Cline, Eric H. (2014-03-23). 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Turning Points in Ancient History) (pp. 172-173). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.Followed shortly afterward by saying:although we don't know how contemporaneous the final destructions actually were in Greece, it is clear that after the catastrophes were over , ""there were no palaces, the use of writing as well as all administrative structures came to an end, and the concept of a supreme ruler, the wanax, disappeared from the range of political institutions of Ancient Greece."" 3 In terms of literacy and writing, the same holds true for Ugarit and the other entities that had flourished in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age, for with their end came also the end of cuneiform writing in the Levant, replaced by other, perhaps more useful or convenient, writing systems.Cline, Eric H. (2014-03-23). 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Turning Points in Ancient History) (p. 173). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.This book is not history made simple, but a very readable, complex analysis worthy of any person interested in ancient history.  Every aspect of the cultures of the Late Bronze Age and it's decline as listed above, and more are examined and evaluated with reference to the source of the knowledge.  Older references and viewpoints are referenced, and supported or refuted.  With the copyright of 2014, Cline has the book right up to date on discoveries made recently.A good read, A good summary of current knowledge, well worth the time to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PSY9L6G1TQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691140898#wasThisHelpful","R22PSY9L6G1TQX","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - ""The Sea Peoples:  The Mysterious Nomads who Ushered in the Iron Age""The Sea Peoples"" is a short, little book running to a full 32 pages.  It summarizes our knowledge of a mysterious group of tribes who invaded the established Eastern Mediterranean World in the Bronze Age just at the time the Bronze Age was collapsing into a Dark Ages from which the Iron Age arose. There are many quotes from the Egyptian tablets and a few quotes and archeological references from the Egyptians and the ancient Greeks and other cultures of the Late Bronze Age.This book takes the slant that the Sea People were tribes that arose from Asia Minor and perhaps south east Europe (the Balkans).  They may have been Trojans  who migrated after being defeated at the destruction of the Troy of that age. Some may have come from Italy, or perhaps through Italy from Asia Minor.The book is well written.  It is easily read in under an hour.  The book does give the reader an understanding of the lack of knowledge of the Sea Peoples, and mentions the destruction wrought by them and in their time.  The language is not pedantic or heavily laden with scientific terms.  Unfortunately there is just not enough information in this book to locate in history or enough background given to teach people of the Late Bronze Age and its collapse.I would encourage reading this in conjunction with the book ""1176 B.C.""

"Review – Where the Negroes are Masters by Randy Sparks“Where the Negroes are Masters” is the story of the major British slave and gold trading port in West Africa, on the Gold Coast, Annamaboe.  Annamaboe is a city that thrived only during the slave trade.  This is the story of it's rise and fall.  It still exists, but only as a mere shadow of it's former glory.The intrigues, diplomacy successes and failures, the strong personalities, the strife between the Native Tribes (mostly Fante and Asante) and the British with extensions into the French and Spanish and Portuguese,  the battles and problems of governing such a place, the cultures and empires of the Fante and the Asante, the Native merchants and rulers and peoples, and much more are well described and their interactions discussed.Randy Sparks enables us to see the “Atlantic World” of trade between South America, North America, Europe and Africa.  In this book Randy focuses on the Gold Coast and its role.  The other legs of the “Black Atlantic” are in many other books.  This is a side of the story seldom told til recently.  We even get a chapter on slave trading in the African interior between the African Empires.The book is well and interestingly written.  The stories of power and greed and gore are well done.  The reader comes away from the book with a much better understanding of Africa and the Gold Coast slave trade.  The detail is amazing, gleaned from historical records and primary sources.  The notes and bibliography are nearly 25% of the book.For a more reading on the slave trade,  I recommend both Meredith Martin's “The Fortunes of Africa”  A 5000 Year History of Wealth Greed and Endeavor,”  and Paul Lovejoy's “Transformations in Slavery (African Studies).”  These two give a wide angle view of the slave trade where Sparks chose to concentrate on one major port.  For a modern, not Eurocentric view, both the wide angle and the sharp focus are recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OD5IG2VWXHQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674724879#wasThisHelpful","R1OD5IG2VWXHQH","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are lists of the color and season of flowering, short vs tall, city street, hedges, shade, foundation plantings, noise barriers, bird attractors, specific soil types, specimen selections, bark effect, poisonous twigs or flowers, or other parts of the plant,  pictures of shape and height at various ages, windbreaks, and yet many more.  Where useful growing zones (old version) are listed.Note: all lists are by scientific name without common names or scientific synonyms.  Also, the attributions are left off the scientific names.  The only common names used are in the lists of varieties of a species, where the scientific name would not be of use.This is a very handy book for professional garden planners or the very advanced amateur gardeners.  Unless you have need for this information on a frequent basis and the knowledge of the scientific names of plants, you don't need this book.The German version of this  book came out in 1970.

"Review – Invasive Plants:  Weeds of the Global GardenInvasive Plants is a fascinating little book.  It lists 80 plants brought from elsewhere than the USA that are known to be invasive.  Reasonable pictures,  good descriptions, brief analysis of which portion of the USA is bothered, tips on how to handle these 80 plants are all included.  Each plant gets its own page.  The amazing thing is that most of these plants are still being sold in the nurseries, at least in some portions of the US.The authors took two comprehensive plant directories and abstracted over 300 non native plants they consider to be problems with crowding out native species, damaging habitat for both domestic and wild animals and bird, endangering and overwhelming native bioms.  From these 300 they selected these 80 plants for being common and possibly wide spread and a serious problem in some portion of the US.A short list of the plants the authors included is:  Japanese Honeysuckle, ice plant, Amur maple, butterfly bush, tall fescue,  reed canary grass, pampas grass, Siberian Elm, Multifola Rose, bachelor's buttons, English holly, Japanese Barberry, black locust, paper mulberry, dames rocket and so on up to 80 plants.This book also contains some hints on management of these pests and hints on overall unwanted plant control.This book is useful for those planning gardens as to which plants to avoid.  The answer is often surprising.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L9OTC58NT7YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0945352956#wasThisHelpful","R3L9OTC58NT7YN","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – “Transformations in Slavery:  A History of Slavery in Africa” by Paul Lovejoy.  3d Edition 2012“Transformations in Slavery” is a detailed study of slavery in Africa.  Dr.Lovejoy states in his Preface to the first edition (1979) that the history of slavery in Africa, as opposed to the Atlantic and Mid Eastern diaspora of Africans via enslavement is extensive and poorly studied.  This 2012 edition is the third edition of this book; the first having been published in 1979.Dr. Lovejoy examines the numbers, utilization, process of enslavement, marketing, and development of slavery inside Africa, concentrating on the Fifteenth through the Nineteenth Centuries.  This is not a diatribe against slavery, nor an apologist essay.  This is a fact and number filled overview of  slavery in Africa as it existed from the fifteenth century through the nineteenth century.  The detail as to numbers and locations is astonishing.  The history is much more complete than I knew existed.  Dr. Lovejoy throws much light on the development of plantation farming over these years and on the role of the Muslim traders, and how their changes from warrior to reformist impacted the slave trade and slave utilization.  Dr Lovejoy gives us an understanding of the four major forms of slavery, Kin vs not Kin, plantation and other production, harem, and military.  Dr. Lovejoy gives us a view of the impact of the European abolishment movement and some details as to how that movement affected the interior slave trade in Africa.The book is well and clearly written.  The charts and maps are helpful.  The formatting on my ipad  and iphone was good.  This book is essential for anyone wanting to understand slavery as it existed in Africa and how that impacted both the Atlantic and the Muslim markets for slaves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPYGZLI6HRJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GPIGPY#wasThisHelpful","R1NPYGZLI6HRJC","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - The Fortunes of Africa:  A 5,000 Year History of Wealth, Greed and Endeavor by Martin Meredith""The Fortunes of Africa"" is a rather large survey of the long, complicated history of Africa.  As such it picks out highlights of the history.  The book gives the reader a brief taste of the various parts of Africa in turn as it's focus shifts round and round the huge geography of the continent and through the 5000 years.  The huge amount of material this book surveys limits it's ability to do any location or era true justice.  Yet, Martin Meredith, who has written other books on Africa, succeeds in giving the reader a creditable taste of the huge table.The book is well written and enjoyable to read.  There are almost no pictures, only two or three maps in my Kindle edition.  The maps on my iphone were too small to be of use.  The selection of the material is by necessity eclectic.  The coverage of the various selections Martin Mededith choose is adequate to understand and appreciate  the breadth of the history and to come away better informed than before reading the book.I found the book enlightening and informative on a continent and a history of which I have seldom been exposed.  I would recommend ""The Fortunes of Africa"" to persons wanting to know more of an important part of human history that is all to often passed by.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ODH8OK09AP1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZBA9M4#wasThisHelpful","R3ODH8OK09AP1N","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Talibanistan by Peter Bergen“Talibanistan” is an accounting of the peoples and places of the Taliban in Afghanistan as of 2011 with only necessary references into the Pakistani Taliban as of 2011.  The book is amazing in the detail and naming of names and locations of many of the Taliban leaders.  Peter Bergen does give a disclaimer that only those names and places known to the Western Allies and Afghanistan are listed.  Others may be referred to, but not with detail to identify them.  But the known list is very lengthy.The book is horrifying in its accounting of the civil right abuses and outright military overreach of both the Kasai Government and the western militaries.  These are presented in quoted interviews.  In fact the book point blank states that abuses and overreaching by the Kasai Government and the western military, such as home invasions, confiscation, and imprisonment are the reasons for many of the Taliban from their first Taliban Surge, returning in the Taliban Resurgence.Unless the reader has detailed knowledge of the geography and history of Afghanistan, the book is hard to read.  Otherwise the book is well written and quite readable.The histories, policies and strategies of the Taliban are only briefly discussed.  This is mostly an accounting of the people of the Taliban in 2011, how they came back into the movement, and who is talking with whom.  As such it is fascinating, but rapidly becoming dated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LBTJYCQ0EEOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009R3X9SG#wasThisHelpful","R3LBTJYCQ0EEOU","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Dancing in the Glory of Monsters:  The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa by Jason Stearns“Dancing in the Glory of Monsters” is an overview of the Congolese Wars about 1996 – 2011.  The book covers history and current events from about 1990 to about 2011.  There is much positive acclaim for this book quoted in the front of the book from such as the New York Time Book Review, Wall Street Journal, the  Washington Post, The Economist, The Financial Times and many other reviewers of prominence. Most are calling Jason Stearn's efforts the most balanced and insightful look into the Congolese Wars available.Jason Stearns has spent considerable time in the Congo researching this book.  There are several fascinating personal interviews by Stearns himself reported on with various surviving main players in the story.The book is well written, and very readable.  The story is well told.  There are maps, a mite bit too small in my Kindle version that are very helpful.References are made to the brutality of the wars without subjecting the  reader unnecessarily to the gore and bloodshed.  Although Gore and Bloodshed cannot be totally avoided in reporting on these wars.  The personalities of the various leaders of all sides are well outlined and discussed, with their impact on the Wars and on The Congo.  The extreme corruption that made matters much worse is outlined.  The influence of Rwanda and Uganda are well displayed.  The effects of tribalism, especially the Hutu's and the Tutsi's and that of the Congolese leaders are discussed in some detail.  There are references to western nations such as United States, Canada, Cuba, Britain, and Belgium and the parts they played.  The affects of the diamond and mineral trade are discussed.For those with an interest in recent African History, “Dancing in the Glory of Monsters” is an absolute must to understand this era and locality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HD54DYPGW5D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076M4VDC#wasThisHelpful","R3HD54DYPGW5D8","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - Conditioning to the Core  Brittenham and Taylor""Conditioning to the Core"" by Greg Brittenham and Daniel Taylor is truly a epic work on the core, and the exercises needed to develop it.  At 371 pages it is the thickest and heaviest book on the core I have seen recently published.  But every page is packed with easy to understand information, or charts of exercises.  It is truly a textbook on the core worthy of a three hour college class.  But yet it is simple enough and use directed enough to be practical on any coaches desk.The authors insist that training must be done is three stages:  stabilization, strength and power.  They want us to advance through these stages, and then repeat them throughout life to maintain our cores.  The authors have set up easy to apply and understand and grade tests of the athlete to determine where in the progression above he/she should start and continue.  Their reasoning is that without a stable core, injuries, maldevelopment etc will occur.  And since power is the multiple of force (applied strength)  x speed, then strength must be developed before power.  I concur.The middle of the book is designed around the progression through three parts,  Part II Stabilization, Part III Strength and Part IV Power.  In each section is an clear explanation of that section.  Then each section has anti-extension, anti-rotation, lumbo-pelvic exercises.  Scapulothoracic exercises are in the stabilization section.The book starts with an excellent discussion, but not nerdy or pedantic, of the core.  Recent research on the core and exercise physiology is explained clearly and in easily understandable terms.  The book ends with a section on core testing, the complete core program, advanced core programs, and finally sport specific core programs.Each of the exercise sections has the excises well described, well pictured, and well placed in the ongoing core program.  Charts outline the basic exercises in each section and the progression of difficulty in each section.  These charts are large, clear, and well explained.  Note that Chapter 5 is a listing of 24 specific benefits of an exercise.  The charts refer back to this section to show us the purpose of each exercise.While at first glance, this book would seem to be a tome, it is actually an easy to use and apply outline of an excellent core development program, and a life time core maintenance program.  For a coach seeking a core program for his athlete's, imho, there is no better guide out there than this book.  For an athlete seeking to develop his core, this is an excellent guide.  To it's benefit, This is not a quickie book or catalog for core exercises, but the design of a complete core program.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R88782YYJZBZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450419690#wasThisHelpful","R88782YYJZBZU","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review:  “The hunt for Kimathi” by Ian Henderson with Philip Goodhart.“The Hunt for Kimathi” is the exciting story for the long, dangerous, exciting hunt to capture the last of the Mau Mau leaders, Dedan Kimathi, in Kenya.Ian Henderson was raised with the Kikuya Tribe's people in Kenya, and spoke their language fluently,  He also was nearly as much at home crawling through the forests of Kenya as they were.  Also Ian Henderson was at home in an English drawing room sipping tea.  Ian earned two “George Medals” for his exploits in the Mau Mau Emergency.  Ian Henderson knew how the Kikuya throught, and knew their customs.  These attributes made him unique and probably one of the very few men, if not the only man, who could lead a “pseudo-gang” of converted Mau Mau to capture their previous leader.The exciting story reads like a light English novel, and one to keep reminding oneself of the seriousness  of the  situation with ongoing raids and mayhem and massacres  by the Mau Mau.  These events actually came near the end of the Mau Mau Emergency and effectively ended the emergency.  There are letter drops worthy of the CIA.  There are treks through untrackable thick forest and thickets.  There are ambushes and attacks and battles.  There are jeep and land rover treks through jungle thickets and deep forests, over hill, dale and mountain. There are secret, bloody, gory, perverted sexual, oath taking rituals described factually as delicately as possible.  There are escapades to make your skin crawl.  There is plenty psychology for those curious about the Mau Mau.  There is plenty of history of the Mau Mau Emergency.The book reads well.  The story is well told.  The pictures are graphic, clear in detail, and fascinating.For those interested in the Mau Mau, this is an excellent resource.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZV3VPYOR2UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CJZHT#wasThisHelpful","R3UZV3VPYOR2UM","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review - Playing for Singers""Playing for Singers:  Art of Accompaniment for the Jazz or Cabaret Piano Player"" by Mike Greensill is a good introduction to the art accompanying a jazz vocalist on the piano.  Mike's wife is a jazz vocalist and he apparently often accompanys her, as well as many other jazz vocalists.  Thus Mike writes from experience.  Being both an introduction, and not a heavy jazz theory book, this book is a slim (120 pages) spiral bound.  And this book is chock full of goodies from that experience.  Mike includes chapters on accompanying with a bass, and with a bass and guitar.The writing is clear.  The examples are well thought out and set easy enough for near beginners at accompanying to master and understand.  The information is good and will give most any beginner to moderately skilled lots of good hints and information on both how to accompany and how to comp.  Mike includes many quotes from many accompanists and from many singers that greatly enhance the understanding of accompanying jazz vocalists.A good grasp of the chords, their basic voicings, basic piano skills, and music appreciation is required to use this book.  It is not a book for beginning piano students.  But that said, most any individual with basic piano skills and understanding of chords who wants to start accompanying vocal artists could gain much from this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDEU0JL76P9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1883217768#wasThisHelpful","R2BDEU0JL76P9M","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review -Afghanistan:  A Cultural and Political History""Afghanistan:  A Cultural and Political History"" by Thomas Barfield is a learned, detailed, well written book by an anthropologist, not a historian.  Thus we are privileged to see the landscape, the people, and rulers, the events through different eyes.  Thomas Barfield not only tells us the history of kingdoms and kings, and battles and wars, but also tells us of the nature of the people of Afghanistan.  He tells us of the why and the how of the history.  The sweep is broad and the story dramatic.Thomas Barfield writes with an educated tongue.  I am glad I have my copy as an ebook so as to use the easy access to a dictionary.  But the writing is clear and intriguing.  The story is well told and fascinating.  The detail is crisp and clear.The book is copyrighted 2010, as a part of the Princeton Studies in Muslim Politics.  Looking through the titles in the collection, this book is in highly esteemed company.Thomas Barfield brings us right up to 2010 with many observations on the status of the politics of Afghanistan at that time.  He spends time tracing the ""longe duree"" and how that long history impacts Afghanistan today.  Thus, if you are looking for a book placing the current events in Afghanistan in their historical context, this is it.  And it does it very well.  Some may disagree with his conclusions. But Thomas Barfield supports his conclusions well.  The book is well worth the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZUPLT9JI6QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ODIRLY#wasThisHelpful","R8ZUPLT9JI6QH","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review Voicing for Jazz Keyboard by Frank MantoothNOTE: THIS BOOK IS NOT A HEAVY TEXT ON MUSIC THEORY.  THIS BOOK IS THE PRESENTATION OF A MEANS OF RAPIDLY CONSTRUCTING CHORD VOICINGS AT THE KEYBOARD.“Voicings for Jazz Keyboard” is an excellent, clear, concise presentation of fourth voicings for jazz keyboard.  Frank Mantooth lays out basic rules, simply followed, for Major, Dominant, Minor chords.  This is followed by “miracle” voicings which give simple variations on the voicings from Mantooth's rules.  These rules and miracle variations are within the reach of every pupil who understands the basic chords.  If the student stops at this point in the book, the student will greatly enhance his/her comping.There are also chapters on blues voicings, and diminished and half diminished chords, which are easy enough for pupils of all levels, although the second half of the blues chapter does go into the polychord material.  Frank Mantooth does, in other chapters, go into altered and polychord functions, melodic soprano voice, and tritone substitution.  His explanations are good, but for the more advanced pupil.For the jazz pupil who understands the basic chords, the discussion on the fourth voicings is excellent.  Frank Mantooth gives the fastest and easiest approach to the 3-6/9 voicings I have seen anywhere.  The C chord in Frank Mantooths voicing becomes  E-A-D-G-C, voiced from the top down in fourths.  This section alone is well worth the price of the book many times over.For the more advanced student who is into polychord harmonies and altered dominant chords, that material is well explained.The chapter on tritone substitutions and half step preparation is well done, and would benefit students of all levels who are working on progressions.  Once the student understands II-V-I,  it is only a short step to II-IIb-I.Frank writes clearly and cuts through the complex to make fourth voicings, which give 3-6/9 , applicable at the keyboard.  He does not just give lots of chords and their variations, but explains the use of the various chords in easily understandable terms.  Frank Mantooth gives a simple approach to constructing the 3-6/9 chords at the keyboard.Excellent book recommended for all students who want to move past learning just C-E-G-Bb for a C7 chord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3JSP8IDWROP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0793534852#wasThisHelpful","R3S3JSP8IDWROP","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review -Imperial Reckoning:  The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya""Mau Mau: The Kenyan Emergency"" by Peter Baxter is a very clean, very nice and respectable report on the official actions of the British governmental officials during the years 1950 - 1060.  The detail of the official actions of the government are well laid out.  The names and personalities of the Kenyan governors and others in power are nicely laid out.  Peter Baxter was born in Kenya, now lives in the US,  and writes extensively of African history, especially the wars of liberation 1950 - 1980.But, reading this at the same time as reading ""Imperial Reckoning:  The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya"" by Caroline Elkins, a Harvard Graduate Student,  the difference in the sides of the story told is amazing.  Baxter briefly mentions brutality and mental illness, and how the majority of the deaths were in his account black on black.  Baxter mentions the pipeline of detainees and forced labor but does not delve into the horrors of these camps like Elkins does.  Baxter makes brief reference to the racism and immorality of the white settlers.  Elkins remarks on a Nairobi social club frequently visited by the settlers in which on entrance the  members were obliged by their own rules to switch partners and rooms were provided for ""entertainment.""  The screenings of all blacks in Nairobi for Mau Mau sympathy and aid, Operation Anvil, is mentioned in both books.  Baxter merely states the men and many women were taken to detainee camps outside the city.  Elkins talks of beatings, torture, castration, starvation, exposure to elements and other mistreatment of the blacks taken off the street on the merest whiff of evidence, suspicion, or retaliation that occurred in those detention camps.I also have read Peter Hewitt's personal memoirs ""Kenya Cowboy"" of his time in the Kenyan Police Force during this same period.  Hewitt's account is a retelling of his personal experiences and not of the other problems about in Kenyan at that time.  But Baxter quotes Hewitt at length in support of his outlining of the official government actions.  Hewitt's account also testifies to the physical state of the Mau Mau after 1955, which was horrible.  Hewitt's account is very personal as to his actions and experiences.  Hewitt entered Kenya a few short months after the Ruck Massacre, and about the same time as the Lari Massacre.  Hewitt does not go into the pipeline or other aspects of the Emergency.The legends in history classes that adhere to the Mau Mau ""emergency"" are of  vague ""horrible deeds"" done by 1) the Mau Mau, 2) the British officials and army and 3) the loyalists Kikuyu.  While Elkins writes with all the indignation of a person who finds her heroes have clay feet,  Baxter writes to justify and minimize the episodes of the actual history.  I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle.  Both Baxter and Elkins mention the plethora of books on the wars of African Liberation and how they vary in content.  Thus one has to consider the violence and virulence of the period and how both sides and the later researchers are all still pushing their points of view.  Baxter's book is a good outline of the official actions of the British.  Elkins book is researched among the Kikuyu people and well reflects their recollections and oral traditions.  Aside from the similarity of the names of people and places and dates, one would not think one was reading of the same  people, place and period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2441YM1H6AD64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M8SR42#wasThisHelpful","R2441YM1H6AD64","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Aside from the similarity of the names of people and places and dates, one would not think one was reading of the same  people, place and period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9JL4YXTJHD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COCM0TG#wasThisHelpful","R1O9JL4YXTJHD6","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review – Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla Carlos Marighella“Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla"" is a 40 page pamphlet for the urban guerrilla, as opposed to bandits, outlaws,  and right wing counterrevolutionaries.  It was written in 1969 by a Brazilian for use by antigovernment, antipolice, anti United States and anti capitalists fighters.Carlos Marighella was a real figure who was deeply involved in the guerrilla work in Brazil through the late 1950's and through 1960's.  He was several times over captured, imprisoned, tortured and then finally ""eliminated"" in 1969 by the Brazilian police.The book reads fairly well but occasionally the translator slips up on English idiom.  Essentially this is an outline for training urban guerrillas, suitable for stimulating discussion.  At first I thought this was a plant by the establishment.  But I checked and it is not.This is not quite on par with Che Querva's “Guerrilla Warfare” or Mao Zidong's “The Red Book of Guerrilla Warfare” both more famous works on guerrilla fighting.  Che focuses more on the rural freedom fighter.  Mao is more generalist in approach.  Nor is it as in depth as General David Petraeus's “US Army/ Marine Counterinsurgency Field Manual.”  But as a stimulus to more in depth discussion,  for training recruits, this is excellent. This book has also been popular with various other guerrilla, antiestablishment groups around the world.For those interested in the methods of the guerrilla, this is an excellent part of the history.  The book does not go into philosophy or history of the movements.  But the Minimanual is excellent for techniques and attitudes of the urban guerrilla.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXWFIQ1ARGL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KNWVCI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXWFIQ1ARGL6","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review – The Mongols A very short Introduction“The Mongols:  A Very Short Introduction” is what it says it is.  For a quick overview of the rise of Ghengis Kahn and the next four generations of Mongol Rule from Hungry east through China with incursions into Russia, Korea and Japan, this is good.  The details of the four main branches of the Ghengis Khan empire from about 1200 to about 1400 are fascinating.  The military history is too complicated to understand in this short version, but the quick review is well done.  The cultural and artisan history is also quite brief as expected from the title, but outlines the subject quite well.  The book leaves one hungering for more.  This book is necessary as the usual Western treatment of this topic is to ignore this history, important as it is.  Combined with “The Silk Road A Very Short Introduction” by James Millward the reader can get a good snapshot of the importance of Central Asia and Mongolia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HI4GFNR2U2PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M7I0LU#wasThisHelpful","R1HI4GFNR2U2PY","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - One Tribe at a Time by Jim Gant""One Tribe at a Time"" (published October 2009)  is an article by  Special Forces Major Jim Gant expressing his opinion that the only way to ""win"" the ""war"" in Afghanistan is to work directly with the individual tribes.  Jim Gant does not feel that working with the national level or even regional level governments will win us the war.  Gant had the opportunity to work closely and intimately with one of the Pushtan Tribes (al la Lawrence of Arabia type work) and found the experience rewarding and fruitful.  Gant has looked at the history of Afghanistan and found that many experts claim the only lasting power sources in Afghanistan are the tribes.  This article is his opinion that we must align ourselves with the individual tribes to gain their confidence and good will to defeat the Taliban.The bibliography is impressive.  The writing is clear and well done.  The intext references to such as General Petreaus (author of a brilliant book on counter insurgency) and Andrew Exum (former Army Ranger Captain with Afghan combat experience)  are several and supportive.  See the ""Introduction"" by Steven Pressfield for more.  The message that insurrections are won over time by working with the local peoples is well established, but frequently for various reasons not followed in modern warfare.  This article is an articulate call to use that philosophy in Afghanistan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32KM5JC6EA2PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEN31W8#wasThisHelpful","R32KM5JC6EA2PF","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review – Three Sips of Gin“Three Sips of Gin” is Tim Bax's autobiography.  He takes us from his childhood, through his training in the RLI and then the Selous Scouts, into his work after Selous Scouts.  There is plenty of raw, personal material on the Selous Scouts to please the military historians.  There is plenty on his training in the English and Rhodesian armies.The book is well and entertainingly written.  The style is upbeat and brisk.  Tim's story is told in a series of escapades and adventures.  This should be considered a primary source on the Selous Scouts of the Rhodesian Civil War.  The events and escapades narrated are fascinating and a pleasure to read.  It makes for a good read.Recognizing that this is Tim's autobiography, and that he had a sizable role in the Selous Scouts, this is a good addition to the material on the Selous Scouts.  He gives many personal anecdotes and stories about the people and activities of the Selous Scouts.  Tim gives us his personal opinion of many of the individuals in the Selous Scouts from Ron Reid-Daly , who he considers a close friend, down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOO55BXQRVLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909384291#wasThisHelpful","R2OOO55BXQRVLE","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Glen Cordoza and Erich Krauss are both professional Muay Thai kickboxers who have helped several other MMA fighters write books.  The result is an excellent, well organized guide to MMA fighting.  There is no fluff here, no long explanations or descriptions either.  Fedor gives a brief history of his life and then lurches directly into the various strikes, blows, holds, throws etc.The book is what it says,  The Fighting System of Fedor and that is very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R172TD1A89TCOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0977731545#wasThisHelpful","R172TD1A89TCOR","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - Africa Lost:  Rhodesia's COIN Killing Machine Dan Tharp“Africa Lost:  Rhodesia's COIN Killing Machine” by military historian Dan Tharp is a fascinating, but brief history of the Rhodesian Special Air Service and the Selous Scouts from the inception of the Rhodesian  Special Air Service (SAS) to 1980 when the Nationalist won the war.  The story is well told.  The book reads well.  The history is fascinating.There are several forays of the Selous Scouts told in quick detail.  There are several forays of the Rhodesian SAS told in quick detail.  Only 5 or 6 men are named by name.  For those wanting an introduction to the Rhodesian SAS and this portion of the war to end colonialism told from the Colonists military point of view, this is excellent.  The detail is far too sparse to offer the specialist or generally knowledgeable military historian much more than a brief outline.I wish Dan Tharp, with his excellent knowledge and background, would have added a bibliography for those of us wanting more.  He does suggest a few books, from the many published on the African Wars Independence.  But Dan does not give a decent bibliography to help us sort the wheat from the chaff in the morass of books out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM0ZT1WCYQ2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D0K3G30#wasThisHelpful","R2RM0ZT1WCYQ2J","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - Who Will Teach the Wisdom  T BaxWho Will Teach the Wisdom"" is a fascinating little book by a man who has walked the walk.  Tim Bax was a member of the legendary Selous Scouts.  Here he lays out how he found the wisdom to work with the natives of Rhodesia in fighting the anti colonial was in the 1970's.  He lays the story within a unique frame of seeking the wisdom to teach to intense survival classes he is teaching in the jungles.  He starts with a class of 5 women and moves on to preparing for a military, boots on the ground, three week class.  He intermittently, between telling us context from the Rhodesian Front and stories of how he found the wisdom,  tells us of his seeking wisdom, and finally returns to Africa to find 2 new friends to help him teach the wisdom.  He ends with returning to Rhodesia to find two new members of the Tribes to help him teach the wisdom.Along the path we are treated to many excursions into the African Jungle, some successful and some unsuccessful.  He points out many excellent lessons (""It's not where the dogs bark that danger lurks;  it's from the silence of the shadows where you hear no bark."")  Much attention is paid to thinking outside the box.  We get lots and lots of how to treat and interact with others.  And finally the last chapter is a re-quoting of the many nuggets of wisdom placed in their context in his reminiscing about his life in the Selous Scouts.We get glimpses  into the 2 week training of Selous Scouts.  We get many war stories of counter intelligence.  We get many nuggets on tracking and trailing.  We get a glimpse of Ron Reid-Daly, Commander of the Selous Scouts.Over all this is a masterful retelling of the stories of the Selous Scouts, of learning wisdom the hard way, and of military and native tracking and trailing techniques.Tim meets with the leaders of the upcoming military survival class and sees himself from many years previous in their arrogance and their total belief in their skills and knowledge.  He sees where these leaders have yet to learn the Wisdom.  The book tells us how Tim Bax learned the wisdom.  It would be fascinating to see how he taught that wisdom to the succeeding classes, but he does not give us that syllabus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394BZAXF1MYBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615842755#wasThisHelpful","R394BZAXF1MYBK","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review Kettlebell Simple and Sinister Pavel“KettleBell Simple and Sinister” is a superb product from Pavel Tsatsouline through his company StrongFirst.  It is Pavel's claim, backed up by a host of experts he quotes, that a simple program of 3 warm ups (prying goblet squat, hip bridge and KB halo) and two exercises, Kettlebell swings, one and two handed, and turkish get up will make your body strong, hard and flexible.  Looking at the components of the exercises and the warm ups, it cannot be argued that they do not produce a complete program.  It may not lead to records in deadlifts, benches, pullups or pushups.  It may not lead to heavy muscle mass.  But it is a well rounded program. Pavel does state that if you have extreme tight joint issues, or cardiac issues, extra instruction and advice may be necessary.The book is well produced, beautiful to look at and  for the most part easy to read.  The writing is clear.  The directions detailed and easily followed.  The pictures are well done and with the text, demonstrate clearly what is expected.  All of the exercise pictures are works of art with the athletes in black outfits on a black background.  I would like more attention paid to titles and separating important portions of the text.  For instance, the pages seem to flow directly from the warmups to the exercises to Program Minimum Remastered without white space or fonts clearly showing the separation.The book is in two sections.  The first section is detailed instructions and clear pictures forthe warmups and for the two exercises. This ends with “Program Minimum Remastered”, borrowed from Steve Justa, explaining how to do the program.  The second section is a rather long discussion of “hard style” and directions and hints on how to approach the program and the exercises.  This discussion is an excellent presentation of the rather atypical concept of working out without burnout, nearly daily, to achieve more rapid gains.  There is also here the suggestion to give yourself a maxing out trail every two weeks.  Suitable advice to go slow, not to rush the weights or reps.  Pavel includes a fascinating discussion contrasting manual labor, farm labor, and gym exercise.I applaud the inclusion of standards for the warmups, each exercise and the daily performance.  Pavel does state one should only do this workout, 30 minutes daily and no other program.  It requires a leap of faith to leave the routine lifts and programs behind and just do this workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAY5EYKOMK2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GF2HP9G#wasThisHelpful","R1OAY5EYKOMK2Y","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review - Push Pull Swing by Myatt Murphy""Push, Pull, Swing"" is an excellent guide for beginning lifters of dumbbells, kettlebells and sandbags.  We get an excellent philosophy of working all three of the planes if our bodies (sagittal, frontal and transverse) with good descriptions of each and examples of the exercises included in each.  This is followed by a simple but excellent description of each of the three tools mentioned above including how to select your beginning weights and purchase guidelines for each.  Then we get a brief practical anatomical discussion of the important muscles, divided into pushing, pulling, swinging and combination muscles.  There is a good basic discussion of nutrition.  Basic terms are defined in easy to understand language.Part 2 is the exercises themselves.  These are grouped by DumbBell, KettleBell and sandbag. The exercises are well described with easy to follow instructions and hints on performance.  The pictures are good and show the exercises well. The quantity of exercises is plentiful and the selection is good.Part three is the routines.  The first chapter is how to build your own routines based on the exercises and the three planes of movement.  Then are several chapters on sample routines well laid out and easily followed.The book is well and clearly written.  The pictures are good, including some motivational pictures highlighting each chapter.  The audience is obviously beginners, although there are things to be learned by intermediate and advanced lifters.I highly recommend this book to men beginning to lift dumbbells, kettlebells, and/or sandbags.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2M77SN9ME7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623363977#wasThisHelpful","R2H2M77SN9ME7H","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review – The Taliban Revival by Hassan Abbas“The Taliban Revival” by Hassan Abbas is a fascinating glimpse into the recent history of both Pakistan and Afghanistan and the resurgence of the Taliban in both countries in the last 3 – 4 years.Mr. Abbas is a native of Pakistan, and while I did not catch his exact birthplace it is some where in the North end of Pakistan where as a young man he served in a local police force.  Since then he has joined academia and journalism.  This book is a distillation of his personal experiences on both sides of the Durand Line between Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Many are the stories he tells of his experiences as a policeman in the area.  Many are the stories he tells of his personal experiences in Pakistan.  Most revealing is that one of his favorite memories is marching in the protest marches that surrounded Musharraf in 2008.  From these we get the feel of the people themselves and the personalities involved.  Many are the interviews quoted the Mr Abbas had with individuals of all stripes and power levels, mostly in Pakistan, but a few in Afghanistan.Thus while this is a well documented recent history book, it is in many respects a primary source on the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In his conclusion Mr. Abbas states the reasons he feels that the Taliban have had a resurgence in the last 3 years.  He also gives what he feels would be possible solutions to the issues in that area.  These are well thought out and detailed.  It would be a disservice to Mr. Abbas to quote those without the extensive background he supplies to support them.The text of the book is only 60% of the book with extensive notes and index the remainder 40%.The book reads well.  Mr. Abbas's English is impeccable.  The arguments are detailed and clear.  At times I wish I knew more details to more accurately place his comments into the current course of events and cross check what he states. That is my problem, which I am working to resolve.  But I have no reason to doubt his accuracy and fairness.IMHO this is an excellent book detailing recent events in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  It would not be ideal for a first time attempt to learn more of the the issues.  But for the intermediate or advanced educated person is a good place to learn much more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVKZZT0F4VVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300178840#wasThisHelpful","R2AVKZZT0F4VVG","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review ""Five Pound Dumbbell Exercises by Professor AttilaThe stories are told - with a sneer  of disbelief- of the old time strong men who only worked out with 5 pound dumbbells.  Professor Attila is one of those about whom these stories are told.  Well, here is Professor Attila's own 5 pound dumbbell workout straight from his desk, in 1913.  It involves several high rep sets of quite a few different exercises.  I have not tried it to see if it works.  I do not know it if will work.  I suspect that the old time state fair strongmen actually did so many exhibitions that those shows were their heavy 2 -3 x per week workouts and these 5 lb dumbbell workouts were what they did on their ""easy"" days.In any case the exercises are well described.  The directions are easily followed.  And most of the exercises have a satisfactory image of the exercise to accompany the text.  There are several additional exercises beyond the actual workout, all with 5 lb dumbbells.  And that is all we get, and all we were told to expect.The book meets its stated aim of presenting one of the old time strongmen routines.  And it does that quite well.  As a piece of history, this is fascinating.  As an exercise book, it does give a workout, well described and illustrated.  Is the workout worth doing in the modern world?  I doubt it.  But it would be fun to just go through it a few times to see how it feels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20X4QEPA94SIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482092212#wasThisHelpful","R20X4QEPA94SIG","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Power DVD is truly an outstanding presentation of advanced gym exercises to develop ""POWER"" in athletes.  Jim Smith and Joe DeFranco have paired on several presentations for the advanced athlete, presenting outstanding material each time.

Over 90 exercises are described, warning and instructions given and demonstrated.  The manual found on the dvd is helpful, but the dvd actually stands alone.

Jim and Joe add some narrative that is very enlightening.The exercises are divided into lower body, upper body, full body and group of supersetting called ""contrast.""

"Review – Hell Strip GardeningHell Strip Gardening is another great book from Evelyn Hadden.  This time she attacks the “hell strip” between the sidewalk and the curb and shows us how to beautify or make practical “the terrace.” She has previously given us another classic, “Beautiful No-Mow Yards.”First Mrs. Hadden gives us over 100 pages of wonderful, detailed descriptions and pictures of successful gardens on the terrace.  These are excellent, well worded, easily read prose telling the stories of 12 different terraces from Oregon, to Minnesota, to Florida, to California, to Idaho, to North Carolina.  The pictures of the gardens are magnificent and beautiful and mouth watering and motivating.  With these stories and pictures, one is motivated to get out there and rip out the grass and weeds and plant flowers or vegetables.  But Mrs. Hadden wisely advises lots of planning and plotting first.Then Mrs. Hadden talks about challenges from trees, to water issues, to poor soil, to laws and convenants, to vehicles, to wildlife and the “public.”  She has good suggestions for managing all of these and more.Then Mrs. Hadden provides us with discussions of style, plant issues, earth shaping.  She ends with suggestions as to showy flowers and foliage and culinary and medicinal and four season plants.The book reads well, is motivating, is full of beautiful pictures.  This is not a small book coming in at nearly 300pages (296 to be exact), over and inch and a half thick.

"Review – molding a Mighty Back  George Jowett“Molding a Mighty Back” by George Jowett is a classic text on muscle development of the back.  It is also one of a series by Jowett on “Molding a Mighty . . .” including Arms, Legs, Grip and Chest, along with his classic “Key to Might and Muscle.”  Jowett idolizes (his own term for his level of respect for these two men) Saxon and Hackenschmit.  He refers to Max Sick several times.  He mentions Coulter, Shaffer, Kliment, Moygrossy, and Arco.The book is old style, having been written in 1932.  But is quite readable and easily understood.  There are not set patterns, or actual workouts nor suggested weights.  The diagrams are totally period and worth the price of the book.  First we get an overview of the 4 major muscles of the back: Lats, Traps, Post Delts, Ext Oblique of Ab..  Jowett also later discusses the Serratus Anterior and the Erector Spinis as important.  He refers to, but does not name the rhomboids.  I did not see that he discussed the Teres.Then mixed in with a lot of motivational material and references to the older strongmen mentioned above, are directions and diagrams for about 14 exercises.  These are mostly dumbbell exercises.  There are a few bodyweight, and a few self resistance exercises mixed in.  Jowett spends 3 pages giving directions and motivation for the Bent Press, an old style press. (I have seen C Logan and T Stoezel push this recently on their joint DVD.)  He only briefly mentions the chinup or pullup.  The directions for the most part are clear enough.  I occasionally had difficulty understanding if he wanted me to raise my arms in front of me or to the side of me, but the diagrams usually cleared this up.  A few of these exercises seem to have fallen from favor, like tossing a dumb bell from hand to hand overhead (perhaps too many bruised heads?) or the unilateral lat pull over.  Most of us are not doing the “will exercises” as Jowett calls them.  Our term would be self resistance.There are repeated warnings to develop the External Oblique so as to have a square lower back below the flare of the lats.  This he considers essential to good workouts and good posture.Jowett includes some warnings, like not forgetting the Erector Spinis, or putting too much weight in any exercise, especially the overhead press, or standing bent backwards.  He only mentions the overhead press to warn us not to use too much weight as that increases sway back issues.  In general he seems to like lighter to medium weights apparently going for reps and time under tension, although he does not use those terms.For an individual wishing to develop his back, the exercises presented by George Jowett, mostly, would be very useful and mostly worth considering adding to a back program.  For a collector of old strongmen books, this is a real jewel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YA0FIJQUBULJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005T93SWE#wasThisHelpful","R2YA0FIJQUBULJ","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review  The National Grasslands  Francis MoulFor a small size book (153 pages) Francis Moul has packed in a lot of information on the National Grasslands.First there is a brief geological historyThen there is a detailed, fascinating political history with details on the legislation and personalities involved.  This history brings us up to about 1990. Included is more detail on the Buffalo Gap Grasslands in Nebraska.  The constant triangle of conservationists, ranchers, and conservatives is well illustrated in a non emotional, detached way, not really taking any of the three sides.Then all 20 of the National Grasslands are well described with maps.  If one is going to visit, one should get the individual large maps of each grassland.  This is fascinating in its detail as to flora, fauna and geology.Then Francis Moul presents the current status of the National Grasslands and three scenarios for the future.  These include 1)  continuing the status quo,  2) return to the old pre 1930 style open range,  and 3) balanced multipurpose use.  The first is under fire from all three sides.  The second is the least likely and most undesirable.  The third would require legislation and changes to years of practices.The book is well written, reads well, is concise and well conceived.  My congratulations to Mr. Moul on producing such a fine, informative book.  This was published by the University of Nebraska Press and meets their usual very high standards of publication.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGKFT9SNKOT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803283202#wasThisHelpful","R1EGKFT9SNKOT0","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zach presents us with an excellent approach to getting fit and strong, especially as related to wrestling, but for most any activity or sport one wants.  He gives us a good 12 week warm up.  This should get most people well on the way to basic strength and mobility.  Then he presents a challenging and effective basic program for getting ready for wrestling.  Again, this workout would work for any sport requiring mobility and strength.  Thirdly, Zach presents a very challenging (hand stand pushup level) workout for winning at wrestling.  Finally Zach gives basic suggestions as to diet.  He does not push any specific diet, but sure wants breads kept to a minimum.  He does recommend milk for teenagers.  He does recognize many school athletes (high school and college) do not have control of their diets and makes suggestions to help.Zach's descriptions are very good.  The instructions are easy to follow and well written.  The workouts are possible for a dedicated athlete.  Zach does include pictures of some athletes before and after.  Most impressive is the youth who went from 88 pounds to winning wrestling in the 132 pound class.  I especially like that Zach includes chaotic light body weight moves like bear crawl, and rolls in his warmups.  He also encourages activities other than weights and wrestling to get the athletes joints and reactions ready for wrestling.This book would work best for a coach wanting to set up a wrestling strength and mobility program, for which it would be excellent.  Having the teams workout together will really help in motivation and accomplishment.  An individual could follow the book, but the level is challenging enough that a coach is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXZ36TYHMYPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6QQ5I8#wasThisHelpful","R2CXZ36TYHMYPQ","A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KNPE2J0ZX0DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy reading these kind of books of the story behind the story.  Sometimes I wonder about the people that tragedies impact after the story has been replaced in the headlines by the next big story.  Roberts offers a unique perspective, not only of the story behind the story, but also the story of the family of the perpetrator and the struggles they face as they move forward in their lives.This entire book is a lesson of faith and grace in action, especially by the Amish community.  Other than the police and the extended family members, the Roberts family's Amish neighbors were the first to come to offer support to them.  If that isn't God's grace in action, I don't know what is!We don't get answers to why the shootings happened, but this book isn't about that.  It is about forgiveness.  We can all learn a lesson from Roberts and her neighbors as they forgave her son for his crime, immediately after the fact!It is an inspiring book that offers encouragement for everyone, especially if forgiveness is an area you struggle with.  I know I do!This book is such a compelling read, right from the beginning that I had one of my studio families pick it up to browse over during their grandchild's music lesson and couldn't put it down.  I ended up letting them take it home with them so they could finish it!  It is that good of a book, right from the start.If you are looking for an inspirational read about the power of forgiveness, this is a great choice!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"I was really excited to read this book and travel through the year with different readings.  I anticipated a book that I could read with my children to share wisdom from the perspective from an older couple.  However, there were several things I found disappointing about this book.First, I was disappointed when I realized that Sid and Rosie were not actual people, but fictionalized characters.  I was able to overlook it, but it colored the interactions they had with each other, knowing that it was not ideas shared by real people, but by the author.The biggest hurdle for me to overcome was when Wilcock equated the celebration of Christmas with other religions celebrating the birthdays of Buddha or their leaders.  In fact, I found the definition of Christmas given in the book to be a little sickening.  Although the exact birthday of Jesus is unknown, the fact remains that Christmas is when we recognize His birthday, not ""the harmonizing the light of the gospel with the old pagan religion that followed the Earth's heartbeat, the rhythm of the seasons"" (page 31 from the book).  WHAT!?!After I read that, I read the information on the back cover about the author to discover that she is a Methodist minister in the UK.  It seems that Christianity is understood differently in the UK.The most positive thing I can say about the book is that I appreciated the depiction of Sid's devotion to Rosie in the face of her mental illness.  Unfortunately, it would have been more meaningful if they had been actual people.I'm not sure that I could recommend this book to anyone.  It was disappointing and disturbing on so many levels.  This is one I definitely will not share with my friends.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"I enjoyed this book very much.  It is the most descriptive book I have read in a long time.  In fact, it is so descriptive that when I had a couple of moments to read, I thought to myself, ""What was the name of that show I was watching?"" because I thought that I had been watching a show from DVR and forgot that it was a book.  The descriptions were that good!It was clear a lot of research went into this book.  I learned a lot about the culture in Somalia and the geography in the area as well.  I always enjoy reading a book that I learn something from.The characters were nicely written, but I would have appreciated a little bit more backstory to further the connection before the story took off.  I wanted Daniel and Quentin to survive, but didn't have a huge emotional investment in whether they did or not.I was a little surprised to read a couple of curse words in the book.  I never expected to read curse words in a Thomas Nelson book.  I also anticipated a little more of a message of Christianity in the book.  However, I enjoyed the book despite it.Overall, this was a good book.  I think fans of suspense novels would enjoy it a lot.  I would love to read another book by Addison.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Thomas Nelson Fiction Guild in exchange for my honest review.

"This book offers three lovely stories to get readers ready for Christmas to come.In Naomi's Gift, Naomi and Caleb are two characters in a typical Christian romance.  They are wounded from the past and a little hesitant to risk their hearts again.  Readers are reminded that all things are possible with faith.  The best character is Caleb's daughter, who loves Naomi even before Caleb does.It was entertaining to read about the family struggles that occur even in Amish families over the holidays, especially with Caleb's matchmaking sister.  Any single person approaching the holiday season can relate to the inevitable matchmaking that seems to go hand in hand with family dinners!My favorite of the three books was An Unexpected Joy.  Abigail was such a lovable character, with a charming flaw.  I enjoyed reading about Micah's gradual thawing of his reticence over her chatter.  I also appreciated the attention that the author gave to PTSD and that it can even impact Amish communities.  It was interesting to read about the struggles of Abigail's cousins as they were coping with the realities of being shunned and her courage in providing for them.A Christmas Visitor was a nice was to end the collection.  I've never read a book where an English man was contemplating joining the Amish community to be with the girl he loved.  This book had the added charm of not knowing what would happen at the end.  I wasn't quite sure whether Frannie and Rocky would end up together.  That is very rare in a romance story!If you are looking for a light, easy read to get you ready for the Christmas season, this is a great choice.  They stories are quick to read, and filled with lovable characters.  Plus, they are short enough that you can fit them in between shopping trips or waiting for Christmas recital practices to end!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Thomas Nelson Fiction Guild in exchange for my honest review.

"This was a nice book with an interesting premise.  I thought the idea of a murder mystery set in post-Civil War era was an unusual plot, especially one involving a woman as the accused.  Although I was a fan of the plot idea from the beginning, the execution was a little uneven.The beginning was a little slow for me.  I kept forging ahead, thinking that at some point I would click with the characters.  Eventually it started moving ahead and I became curious about what would happen.  The thing that bothered me were the hints about India's romantic interest in Philip.  It seemed a little unnecessary and broke up the flow of the writing.  I was relieved when Love stopped hinting about their romantic interest and left it to develop naturally.Although the writing was a little contrived at the beginning, in my opinion, once the story took off it got much smoother.  There were some surprises and plot twists that are always enjoyable in a novel.  I enjoyed the book at the end and found myself to be a fan of Love's writing.  This book was truly an example of why it pays to keep reading past a rough beginning.The aspect of the book that I enjoyed the most was the research that went into it.  Love paints a picture of life post-Cival War in the South that is accurate and detailed.  I loved reading about the real-life people that inspired some of the characters.Overall, this turned out to be a nice story.  I enjoyed it once the story got underway, even though there were a few bumps in the beginning.  The historical details and plot twists make the whole book worth reading.  I am looking forward to reading another book by Dorothy Love.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review as part of the Thomas Nelson Fiction Guild.

"This is a very unusual Amish fiction book.  Fuller's book explores greed, abuse, and deception in the context of an Amish community.  I found it to be a refreshing change from the typical Amish fiction.  Most Amish fiction paints the Amish lifestyle in an idyllic fashion where everyone lives together in peace and cooperation.  I'm not sure which one is the most realistic, but it was very interesting to read this different style of Amish fiction.The best part of this book is the realistic aspect of the situation in which Sadie finds herself.  I lived in a rural community where there was a large Amish population, so I am well aware of the realities of car versus buggy accidents and how catastrophic they are for the buggy occupants.In romantic fiction, it is usually pretty obvious who will couple up and live happily ever after, so I always look at the journey of how they get from point A to point B.  Fuller does a great job in pacing the book so that it isn't too obvious or gives away too much too soon.  Aden and Sadie are lovable characters that struggle with real-life problems.  Readers can't help but root for them to find happiness.If you are a fan of Amish fiction, you will probably enjoy this one, especially since it is different from other Amish fiction out there.  I really enjoyed it!I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

"When my youngest and I talk about reading the Bible, he always says, ""But I just don't understand what it all means.""  I can't wait to pass this book on to him.  Peterson offers readers the complete Bible in 100 readings, in contemporary language that is easy to understand.  It isn't even a phrase by phrase rewrite of the Bible, but seems to be more of a summary of several verses in paragraph form.It is very easy to read and understand, even more so than the NLT version.  Peterson definitely takes the Bible and transforms it into reading more like a novel.  I liked the idea of reading the Bible in sequence, not necessarily book by book.  It helps readers to get a fresh take on familiar stories.I liked so much about the book that it is difficult to offer any criticism.  However, I did find the readings a little bit too long.  I had a hard time getting through the reading for each day in my morning time.  I had to go back and find time later in the day or carry the book with me to steal reading time throughout the day.  It might have been better if the book was formatted for a year-long reading, instead of 100 days, and had shorter selections each day.Overall, I think this book would be great for a teen or for someone new to reading the Bible.  It is also a nice choice for anyone wanting to look at the Bible with fresh eyes.  However, it is definitely a devotional book and does not lend itself easily to looking up specific stories or verses.  Despite the small criticisms, I would recommend this book to anyone as a supplemental Bible resource.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"Who doesn't remember the horrible things that happened to the Petit family?  We all read the headlines and heard about the terrible murders of a mom and two daughters.  However, as usually happens, once the story is replaced in the headlines, we don't give much thought to what happens afterward to the survivors.  This book gives us some insight into how Bill has moved forward in his life.I wasn't sure if I would like this book and almost didn't read it because I was nervous that it would be too gruesome.  Fortunately, D'Agostino focused more on the lives of the women in the Petit family and not on their murders.  He then turned his attention to how Bill faced life as the sole survivor in his family.  I found the detail of the trials interesting and was glad to read about the conviction of the murderers.The best part about this book was reading about the strength of character of Bill's new wife.  It would take a very special woman to provide the kind of love and support that Bill needs after living through the tragedy that he has.  I was also very relieved that D'Agostino didn't dwell on the details of the murders.  The basic facts are enough to create nightmares!If you ever wonder about the story behind the headlines, this is a great book to read.  It is a story of survival, not just of Bill's survival, but the survival of an entire extended family.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.

"This book started very slowly for me.  I realized I was on chapter seven and still had no idea what was going on.  I usually don't read the description on the back of a book prior to beginning it because sometimes they give away so much information that it takes away some of the surprise.  I felt like I was in danger of not being able to finish the book, so I read the back to get an overview of the book.  I was really glad I did because the rest of the book went much more quickly than the first several chapters.Healy has a gift for crafting fiction with a lot of depth.  Readers have the task of peeling back layer after layer to get to the core of her characters.  I really enjoy the multi-dimensional aspect of her writing, but I struggled with this one.  My problem was that there were a large number of characters introduced in a very short time.  I wasn't able to form an attachment with any of the characters straightaway, because I really wasn't sure who the main characters were going to turn out to be.  It was even more complicated sorting out the characters because some of them were referred to by different names, for example, Daniel and Grandy (who was the grandfather and also the son-in-law).  It was probably super challenging to decide how to refer to each character when there was a multi-generational family living under one roof.  Fortunately, I eventually figured it out and got to know all the characters.Although I had difficulties keeping track of the characters at the beginning, once the plot took off, it didn't stop.  There were several surprises throughout the book that were exciting to read, especially when I am not a huge fan of suspense books.The best part of the book for me was the message.  Woven throughout the book is the theme of the importance of family, even if it is manufactured by a group of homeless youth trying to band together to form a ""family unit"" under a bridge.  I thought the love of the Fox and Coz was heartbreaking, but realistic.  I also thought the concept of family as a dynamic organism was fun to read about.  It is always a good book when you end up sort of rooting for a flawed character.Healy has a gift for crafting her stories.  They are so detailed and measured that readers can't help but enjoy them, even if they take a little while to get underway.

"I am always a little leery of ""prosperity gospel"" type books, so I was a little nervous when I began this one.  I was so happy to realize that this was not a prosperity gospel book.  Rather, Ahn leads readers through various ""decrees"" that really help readers to recognize all the blessings we receive.  I've found that I am much more aware of all the amazing ways that God blesses me.  I also thought the format of the chapters was interesting.  The chapters begin and end with a decree.  The first is a decree from Ahn over us and the final one is the same decree,but written in the first person.  It really makes it personal.I also enjoyed the personal stories throughout the book.  It is so easy to fall into the idea that pastors or leaders in ministry have it all together, especially in regard to their personal relationships.  Ahn is very honest about difficulties he experienced with his father and his wife.  However, we are reassured that even in difficult relationships, we still receive God's blessings.Sometimes it is easy to understand that God wants to bless us, without really anticipating that he will.  Although this book is a little dry to read sometimes, it does a great job applying Biblical principles to every day life.  I have found that I am living life in a much more expectant state since reading this book.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Chosen Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"I am a fan of everything I have ever read by Candle Books.  The illustrations are always so bright, vibrant, and naturally appealing to children.  This one is a pretty lengthy for a children's book of prayers.  It even has a table of contents to help readers find the section they are looking for.I really enjoyed the diverse assortment of prayers offered in this book.  Some are poems by well-known authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson, others are prayers by ministers from the past, and others are directly from Scripture.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see the assortment of prayers.  Children's prayer books typically offer morning prayers, mealtime prayers, and bedtime prayers.  I was pleasantly surprised to find prayers for family members, prayers for help, and also prayers of thankfulness.  What a wonderful way for children to learn that they can approach God in every circumstance.If you are a parent or grandparent looking for a book to help guide the children in your life to approach the Lord no matter what they are experiencing in their lives, look no further than this one.

"I generally enjoy reading fiction books to non-fiction books, especially historical fiction.  This is one of those rare non-fiction books that reads like fiction.  I can't ever remember staying up late into the night to finish a non-fiction book, but this one kept me up!  I sat up late on the couch finishing the book because I couldn't sleep until I found out what happened to Toquette, Philip, and Sumner.The best part about this book is that readers learn about people that are not commonly known.  I had never read about many of the Resistance fighters that were mentioned in the book.  It was also interesting to read about and be reminded about the French people that were cooperative with the Nazis.  I thought Kershaw did a great job presenting both sides in a factual way.I also found it interesting when Kershaw referred to the round-up of French Jews, with the consent of the the Vichy government.  I had read a fictionalized account of the event in Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay, so I enjoyed making that connection.  It isn't something covered in a lot of books, so I was glad that Kershaw made mention of it.The only criticism I could identify is that there is a lot of introduction of different people and it isn't immediately clear how they relate to each other.  However, I enjoyed reading about their different stories, so it didn't bother me too much.  Other readers might be bothered by it more than I was, so I mention it here.If you are looking for a different perspective on the Nazi occupation of Paris, this is a great choice.

"I've been a fan of WWII fiction for a long time, so I was really excited to read this book.  It didn't disappoint!  Most of the action takes place in modern times, but the sinister beliefs of the Nazis permeate throughout the book and the struggle against good and evil in woven from cover to cover.The characters of Roger and Katherine grabbed me straightaway and I couldn't wait to find out what happens to them.  The plot is well-crafted and pulls readers in.  The beginning is a little slow-paced, but once things start coming together, it really takes off!  Books where the perspective shifts from one character to another are not my personal favorite type of fiction, but the literary elements were so strong that I was able to hang in there until the storylines converged.I would never characterize myself as a fan of suspense books, but I really enjoyed this one.  My heart was pounding and I wasn't quite sure how it would all end.  I found myself racing through the book, just to find out what would happen.  You can't help but root for Roger and Katharine to survive!There was plenty of humor to be found in the book as well.  It was interesting to read about Roger experiencing present day life with eyes from the 40's.  Barry did an amazing job keeping Roger's experiences authentic to his mindset.This is one of the best fiction books I've read in a long time.  It has a little something for everyone, whether you are a fan of historical fiction, suspense, or even romance.  I only hope that we can see more of Roger and Katherine in a future book!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"So many times we do things because we ""should"" and not necessarily because we are led to do them.  I can only imagine that the pressure on her as a pastor's wife was so much more than any pressure that I might experience.  However, as a fellow ""good girl"" I can identify with her in the fact that some of the greatest pressure to perform comes from within and not necessarily from a good place!I enjoyed reading about her journey and especially about the resistance she met from others that didn't understand.  It was very inspiring to read about her consciously making the decision to step back and listen.  We get so caught up in our day to day responsibilities that it is hard sometimes to be still and just listen!This would be a great book for a woman's group to read together and discuss.  Maybe not everyone needs to take the hard-line approach that Gotthardt did, but it would be worthwhile for anyone to take stock of where we stretch ourselves too thin and also what suffers because of it.  Every commitment we make has a cost, even if it is the cost of our time and energy.  I've made more thoughtful decisions about what I choose to do.The only criticism I have about the book is the organization of it.  I would have enjoyed it better if it was more chronological.  There was a little bit of looking back in the past in the middle of it.  I would have felt a better connection with the author if I had read her backstory and how she got to the place she was at to make the decision to say ""no"", instead of starting at the beginning of her journey of saying ""no"" and then looking back at the whys.However, I appreciated her sharing how easily ""stuff"" crept back in at the conclusion of her year.  I could totally identify with how easily it is to say ""yes"" to one thing, then there is something else, then something else, and the next thing you know you are overtaxed.  We can do it all, just not at the same time!  Some of us have to constantly be on guard.If you are looking for a book to help free you from the cycle of biting off more than you can chew, check this one out.

"I wanted to read this book because I find the medical field interesting and thought that it would be cool to get the inside scoop into how doctors are trained.  I think that McCarthy did an amazing job giving readers a glimpse into the life of an intern, not just the medical parts, but the thoughts and feelings that interns experience.What was surprising to me was that McCarthy (and the other interns) were as unprepared as they were at the start of their internship.  I guess I always thought that the doctors you encounter at the hospital had more confidence in what they are doing.  After reading this book, I view doctors more like regular people.I also appreciated the way that McCarthy gave readers resolutions to the patients that he encountered, where there was resolution.  I was wondering about some of the patients and hoping that I would find out what happened to them.  On the other hand, some patients just disappeared, which kept it realistic.The criticism I have about the book is the language.  Perhaps interns drop the f-bomb frequently in conversations, but it wasn't necessary in the book.  Readers beware, you will have to skip over many curse words.  It is unfortunate, because if it weren't for the foul language, I would recommend this book to teens potentially interested in a career in medicine.  As it is, I would have to rate this as an adults only book.  I am not naive enough to think that teens don't curse, but I wouldn't recommend a book to them in which there is cursing.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.

"There is so much of this book that I could identify with.  Sometimes I think I'm the only one that has to fight with the voices in my head, so it was encouraging to read about Chrissy's battles.  The words might be different, but the message is the same and it comes from the same source.  I loved reading of Chrissy's triumph over the darkness.This book is a great read for anyone who has struggled against the voice telling them they aren't good enough or leading them down the path of If only...  Stories such as Chrissy's read like fiction because they are so unbelievable, but carry such hope because they are real.  The conclusion of Chrissy's story is better than any fictional story could be.As a parent, the tough love approach of Chrissy's parents was difficult to read because I can easily imagine the cost and despair they experienced.  But joy comes in the morning!This story has a little bit of everything for everybody, whether you are a parent, a teenager struggling with the same issues as Chrissy, a musician who understands the power of a song, or anyone who has dealt with addiction or obsession.  If you or someone you know is or ever has struggled with deception or despair, you will identify this book and enjoy it.  I also think it is a great read for any teenager, especially teenage girls who are constantly faced with lies every day.  It's too bad that it couldn't be read and discussed in a public high school.  I think a lot of teenage girls could find encouragement in it.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"I thought this book was very fun to read.  I enjoyed revisiting Andi and her family and I am a big fan of Marlow.The best part about this book for me was the descriptiveness of the cattle drive.  Marlow does a great job of capturing experiences that the workers of a cattle drive might have experienced.  It is one thing to know that cowboys would drive cattle across rivers and eat the food that the cook was able to carry along, but another thing to experience the dangers and monotony through the eyes of a young girl.  Young readers, especially those studying the west, will benefit from Andi's reflections of her experiences.I also enjoyed this book from the message of it.  Andi is so desperate to participate in the cattle drive, but soon understands that the reality of life on the trail is much different from what she imagined.  I can certainly identify with that!Marlow delivers something for everyone in Heartbreak Trail.  There is danger, mystery, excitement, and the love that a family has for each other.

"I thought this book was filled with great advice and concrete exercises to improve any marriage.  Even though the book is geared for couples who are trying to heal their relationship after separation or divorce, I thought it had really good information that could be applied to any marriage.  After all, all marriages encounter disagreements and stressors.I really enjoyed how the authors referred to Nehemiah throughout the book.  It is a book of the Bible that I haven't studied, so I really felt like I learned a lot.  The best part of the book is that the authors don't just tell readers to do something without providing us with the necessary tools to put it into practice.  For example, they encourage readers to keep a journal.  If you are not familiar with journaling, it is not an easy thing to start.  However, they give a step-by-step framework on how readers can go about writing a journal entry.  I need that kind of concrete instruction!Although this book would be helpful for any spouse, it does assume that both partners are invested in putting effort into the relationship.  I'm not sure how helpful it would be if one partner was already completely checked out.  It would still be beneficial as a tool for personal growth, but both parties need to participate.This book is a must read for anyone who is desperate to save their marriage.  It is a short book that is quick to read, and is much less expensive than divorce!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"I had a bit of difficulty in making it through this book.  It never hooked me where I was so invested in the characters or the plot where I couldn't wait to find out what happened.  The characters are nice enough, but the plot felt a little too forced, in my opinion.  It is a given that these type of historical fiction romance novels end with the main characters in love forever.  For me, I like to read to discover how it all happens.  I thought there were a couple of minor surprises, for example, I expected Silas to determine his paternity from reading Lucy's journals, but that was not the case.  However, those surprises were not enough to keep my interest.The best part of the book for me was Silas.  I enjoyed reading about his struggle with alcoholism, because I've never read a book of this genre in this time period addressing people struggling against drinking.  I thought it was a nice addition to the book.Overall, I did not enjoy this book.  I wanted to, especially since I enjoyed A Bride for Keeps so much.  I enjoyed revisiting Julia and Everett, but this book didn't grab me as much as that one did.  However, I will definitely give the other books in this series a try.  I just hope that they are more like A Bride for Keeps.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

"I was really excited to read this book after I saw the quote from the back that stated ""Fans of Jan Karon's Mitford series should love Parr's work"" by the Philadelphia Inquirer.  I absolutely loved the Mitford series and devoured every book.I have to admit that the first third of this book left me questioning that remark.  I kept saying to myself, ""There is nothing similar to this and the Mitford novels,"" and I wasn't sure that I could make it through.  I even stopped reading it to read a couple of other books, hoping that I could pick it up with fresh eyes and become engaged in Martha's story.For me, the story really began when Martha encountered ""Boy"".  From that point on, I read because I wanted to find out what happened.  As other characters were included into the storyline and the townsfolk began to interact more, I began to see the Mitford charm seeping into the pages of Parr's novel.  Readers just have to be very patient for the storyline to unfold.I kept reading, looking for clues of the ""unexpected romance"" promised on the back cover.  Unfortunately, I never really encountered an ""unexpected romance"".  I did, however, encounter a rather predictable romance.  That is not to say that it is terrible, but when I read ""unexpected romance"", I expected something completely out of the blue to happen.  There were a couple of surprises in the book, just not in the romantic sphere.I will probably give the next book in this series a shot, if only to find out what happens to Martha and if she is reconciled with her daughter.Overall, this is an okay book.  I'm not super excited about the characters or the plot, but there isn't anything horrible about it either.  If you are looking for a light summer read, you might give this one a try.  If you loved the Mitford series as much as I did, you might love this one.  Just be aware that the story takes awhile to develop.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"I enjoyed this book very much.  There is a lot of information covered in the 304 pages, but it is a quick read.  It is one of those books that make you want to read a little and then spend a couple of days mulling over what you read and what it means to your life.  For me, those are the best kinds of books.I really enjoyed reading the first section of this book about the Ten Foundations.  In fact, I thought they were so interesting and thought-provoking that it could be an entire book on its own.  Reese and Barnett spend a great deal of time explaining each foundation and examples of what they look like in real life.Some books are good about explaining information and others are good about giving advice on changing the way you look at things and live.  This book gives good information and then very specific information on how to apply those ideas in our daily lives.  It is the best kind of non-fiction book!Whether you agree with the ideas in the book or not, this is a very thought-provoking, revolutionary book.  It is one that will be on my shelves for a long time and one that I will read again.I received a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

"I really enjoyed this book on several levels.  I was excited to read another book by Lori Benton, because I thought her novel Burning Sky was great!  Benton delivers another home run with The Woods Edge.It is hard to choose what the best part about this book was.  The attention to detail and craftsmanship of novel is impossible not to mention.  I particularly appreciated the fact that Benton included words that I had to look up.  I haven't done that while reading a book in years!  In the end, for me, it is all about the characters in a novel.  It is hard to finish a book if you don't really care what happens to the characters.Benton has a gift for including a large cast of characters in her novel and writing them in such a way that you care about every one of them.  There is also a lot of growth in her characters.  Just when you think you have them all figured out and written them off as the good guy or the bad guy, they surprise you (kind of like people in real life).  Benton writes characters that reflect humanity.The only negative thing I could say is that the book started off a little slowly for me.  There was a lot happening at the beginning and I was trying to get a sense of what was going on.  However, it picked up and the momentum continued until the end.This is definitely a book to be savored.  If you are a fan of historical fiction, especially Native American fiction, you will enjoy this book.  After reading my second Lori Benton book, I can safely say that I am a fan!

"This is a nice book, but not one that I am super excited about.  I was really intrigued at the beginning, where Thompson states she will not be giving advice about relationships, but showing us how to be alive in relationships by invigorating our soul.  I enjoyed reading her thoughts about how we view relationships, which was really spot on.  I personally tend to ""keep score"" and think, ""I did all this, the least you can do is ______"".  Not pretty (or fair), but honest!This book did provoke self-assessment and reflection, which is the best thing a book about relationships can do for us.  However, I found that as the book went on, I was less engaged and less challenged for that self-reflection that I enjoy in nonfiction books.  It might have been the structure of the book that created the disengagement.  For example, I would have enjoyed more examples of grace in action when confronted with that person that you want to avoid when you see them at the supermarket, rather than a chapter on dealing with difficult people in our lives.I did particularly enjoy the chapter on relationships with our co-workers.  Thompson's thoughts on the idea of the American dream and finding our passion was really refreshing.  I'm still mulling over some of the ideas that she shared and have incorporated them into discussions with my children as they are at the age where they are frequently asked, ""What are you going to study in college?""  Any book that stimulates discussion is one with value!The best part about this book is that it really provoked me to thoughtfully consider the meaning of grace and challenged me to extend it more to the people in my life and myself.  It is an area in which I have always fallen short and have a lot to learn.Overall I have mixed feelings about this book.  It definitely has value and encouraged self-reflection.  However, it didn't excite me or ever give me that moment of ""I have to tell _____ about what I just read"".  If you are currently experiencing a lot of turmoil in your relationships, you might benefit more from this book, but it just wasn't that exciting for me.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

"This is my must-read book of the year!  It is an unbelievable story with a rare perspective of what it is like to be considered a vegetable, yet be fully aware.  This is a compelling story on so many different levels.  Certainly anyone who has worked with or is currently working with people with severe or profound disabilities should read this book.  Anyone who has a family member with disabilities should also read this book.  Martin's story is certainly unique!There are so many things to like about this book.  Who doesn't like a feel-good story about someone who overcomes amazing obstacles?  It is a success story, not just about Pistorius, but also about his family.  What dedication it took for them, especially his father, to care for him for over a decade.  Pistorius shares the good and the bad in an honest way that doesn't sugarcoat the realities of how difficult it is to provide care for a person who is unable to care for themselves.Parts of this book were very difficult to read.  The abuse that Pistorius experienced at the hands of caregivers is reprehensible and sickening.  He doesn't say in the book whether the perpetrators were prosecuted or not, but I personally hope they were.  It is a nightmare scenario for anyone who has someone they love in a vulnerable position in a long term care facility, especially if the person in non-verbal.  I'm not sure I needed as much specific information about the abuse that Pistorius described, however, I can understand why he might have felt the need to describe it the way  it was.The only criticism I have about the book is that I would have enjoyed reading more about the misdiagnosis aspect of it.  It wasn't clear to me what the specific diagnosis was (other than a degenerative disease) and I never understood what the doctors determined was the actual diagnosis.I think this book could revolutionize the care industry, especially for people that display the symptoms Pistorius had.  It should be required reading for new hires in every long-term care facility in the world.  I'm not saying that I believe every person who exhibits the same symptoms Pistorius had is as aware as he was, however, how can anyone be sure.  I'm also not saying that their care should be different depending upon whether they are aware of not; the care people who are disabled should receive should be of the highest standard, regardless of their functioning level.  I just think that this book would be a great supplement to the training of people providing hands on care.I received a complimentary copy of this book from BookLook Bloggers in exchange for my honest review.

"This is such a beautiful story of the love of a parent for their son and the struggle of raising a child with special needs.  Throughout the entire book, it was clear that Davidson loves his son just as much as every parent should love their child.  However, he is very honest about the emotions that occur when your child has special needs.  He views his son as a gift from God, but also explains the journey to a new ""normal"".This book is a great source of encouragement.  Although it deals specifically with a family adapting to life with a child with special needs, I think there are great lessons for anyone to read who has ever been disappointed with the hand they were dealt.  When reality does not meet our expectations, we need to adapt and find the lesson and the blessing, even if we have to look really hard.  For that reason, I think this book would be great for anyone who has ever been disappointed in life.What I found most interesting about the book was when Davidson talked about his feelings when other parents ""compare"" their children or share developmental milestones.  It really made me think about how difficult that must be for parents whose children may never reach a certain milestone.If you or someone you know has a child with special needs, or if you would like to become more aware or more sensitive to families with children with special needs, this is a great book.  I think it would be particularly helpful for fathers of children with special needs to read, because it is from a father's perspective.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Book Crash in exchange for my honest review.

"This is an excellent resource!  Whether you are newly married, married for a few years, or married for a lifetime, this DVD can change your marriage.  Each section is short enough that you can easily find the time to watch it nightly for a little over a week, or spread it out over a couple months.  There is also a guide you can download to use to follow along while watching the DVD that summarizes each section.Right from the beginning, Harvey challenges viewers to change the way they view the sin in their partner.  It is super easy to look at your partner and see only the way they sin against you, however, Harvey reminds us that all sin is against God.  It takes away a lot of anger and opens viewers to listen to the lessons that follow.Some of the stories Harvey shares are sad, some are funny, but I could identify with a lot of them.  Sometimes it is helpful to be reminded that others have walked (or are walking) in the same path we are.  Watching this series with an open heart and mind creates an attitude of thankfulness and contentment, not only in your marriage, but in your whole life.In my opinion, this DVD series is helpful whether you watch it alone or with your partner.  I think it is great to watch each section separately and then with your partner.  Even if your partner doesn't want to watch it with you, it can still have a positive impact on your marriage, because it reframes expectations.Whether your marriage is happy, unhappy, energized, or monotonous, this is an awesome resource to improve where you are at.  It can breathe life and hope into your marriage.  I can't wait to read the book!I received a complimentary copy of this DVD in exchange for my honest review.

"I have reviewed other books for Candle Books before and have never been disappointed with the quality of the merchandise or the material presented.  In fact, I really thought I would love this set of Bible dominoes.  However, I have to say that I was a little disappointed over all.First the positives.  The dominoes are bright, colorful, and sturdy.  I think it is very clever that the backgrounds on the various items match their corresponding tile.  For example, the 2 background matches the background of the two men and so on for each one.  It is also nice that there are several matches for each number.  The size and the weight of each domino is perfect for small hands to handle one at a time.  It might be better if they were just a little bit thicker so that they could stand on their own as I can imagine some little guys struggling to hold all of their dominoes at the same time.The negative is that the dominoes themselves don't increase any knowledge of the Bible at all.  There is a small pamphlet included with basic bible stories, but is pretty superficial.  There is no relationship between the pamphlet and the dominoes.  It would have been so much more effective as a teaching tool if the dominoes were labelled with the name of the person it was supposed to represent.  As I read through the pamphlet with my kids we made up our own assumptions as to who was who, and a couple times discovered that someone was someone else.  The pictures on the dominoes do appear in the stories, but there isn't a strong connection.Overall, it is a nice set of dominoes, but I wish it was more educational.

"I'm a fan of Echeverri's colorful illustrations and the funky fonts that I have grown familiar with from her other books.  This one delivers just as strong of a visual punch as the other ones.  The pictures hold the attention of young readers and non-readers alike and the relationship between the number of words on the page and the interest of the picture is perfect.  In some children's books, the child has grown bored of looking at the picture and is ready to turn the page before the reader has finished everything.Not only are the illustrations wonderful, but the writing is also child-friendly.  I loved the way Mitchell used repetition with the ""walked and walked - and sometimes ran"".  Children love that kind of writing and it really demonstrated Mitchell's understanding of her target audience.The story of the book is not one of the most well-known in the Bible.  I really appreciate Mitchell and Echeverri taking the story of the royal official's son and putting it into the hands of young children through their engaging book.If you are looking for a beautiful book with an accurate Bible story, this is a great choice.  I think any young child would enjoy exploring the pictures and hearing it read to them.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Cross Focused Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"McKee hits a home run with his straightforward, no nonsense approach to talking to our kids about an uncomfortable topic.  Everything about this book is relevant, from the back story of what kids are seeing and doing these days, to concrete steps to take when approached by your children with questions, and finishing up with common questions.  Some of the questions he spent an entire chapter on, such as Why Wait? and How Far Can I Go?There are two things about this book that I really liked.  The first is that McKee backed up each of his positions with biblical references and support.  I also liked the tips about what to do when your children ask you something and you are completely taken aback.  McKee helps us to buy a little bit of time to frame an appropriate and thoughtful response.The only thing that I was hoping to see in the book that wasn't there was more information about how to initiate the conversation.  My children don't ask a lot of questions, but I still want to be there go to person.  McKee offers strategies, but I was hoping for more advice.  However, I'm hoping that by utilizing his suggestions, more questions will be forthcoming.  This is too important of a topic to ""hope for the best.""If you are looking for a straightforward book that will help you open the doors of communication with your children about sex, this is the one for you.

"I'm always a little hesitant about choosing to read non-fiction books, especially ones that are characterized to help readers do something.  It seems like a lot of them either do a really good job of explaining why readers should do something, but not how.  Other books do the opposite, they describe how, without fully investing readers in the why.  It is a very rare non-fiction book that delivers the why and the how, but Sampson does it.  Perhaps he didn't have to sell me on the why, but he explained it very well.The best part about this book is how concrete Sampson is in dealing with an intangible subject.  I've never thought it was particularly easy to hear God, but as I read through the book, I thought several times to myself, ""I've had that happen"" or ""Oh yeah, I should pay more attention to that.""  It made this a very exciting book to read.  I usually don't describe non-fiction books as exciting!I really liked the way Sampson dealt with the idea of hearing God through dreams without getting psychoanalytical about it.  His tips are very easy to assimilate into daily life.  However, the best chapter for me was the one about hearing God  in your spirit.  It is easy to second guess what you think God might be saying to you in your thoughts or impressions.  It was in this chapter where I got the most information about checking whether the thoughts are coming from God or somewhere else.  It is something I have always wondered about and now I have a toolbox to check where it is coming from.  That chapter alone makes the entire book worth the price!If you are looking for a book to help you discern the voice of God, this is a great one.  I found it very useful and I think many other readers would, too. I received a complimentary copy of this book from Chosen books in exchange for my honest review.

"I've often noticed biblical themes or phrases in secular books or movies, so I was excited to read this book and see what Harvey had to share.  I enjoyed this book, even though I have to admit that I wasn't familiar with all of the television shows he mentioned.  However, he devoted an entire chapter to the show Lost, so that makes it a five star book automatically to me!  That was my favorite chapter.  Obviously Lost was all about good versus evil and finding the meaning of life as well as sacrificial love.  Harvey pointed out things about Lost that I had never thought about before, which proves to me I need to go back and watch the entire series again!Generally speaking, I really enjoyed the chapters and sections that talked about shows, movies, and songs that I am familiar with.  I didn't find the other ones quite as interesting, although a couple of the movies I thought I should watch.  I was anticipating more details about specific scriptures and lessons, but I still enjoyed the book.  I thought the mazes, crosswords, word searches, and other activities in the back of the book were a lot of fun, too.If you are looking for a fun book, with interesting insights into some popular movies, shows, and songs, this is a great book for you.

"I loved the first book in the Darling series by Gardner and this one was just as good.  It was wonderful to revisit the characters of Nick and Ivy and their adopted children to see how they are doing, and I loved getting to know more about Sephy and Amy.Without a doubt, the best part of this book (and the series) is the characters.  Gardner does an excellent job in portraying a family and describing family dynamics in a normal family.  They don't always get along, sometimes they downright dislike each other, but they always love each other.  It is a realistic look into life as a family; sometimes, despite being raised in the same atmosphere, by the same parents, children go off on their own and choose to not participate in the family's life.  We see this in the character of Laura.  The other family members try to include her, but she is still working through her own choices.The plot was interesting, but it seemed to jump around a lot.  I would have enjoyed more focus on Sephy's story and less on Laura's and Amy's story.  In these kind of family series books, I think it is nice for readers to have each book focus on one story in the family, while we see glimpses of the other family members on the periphery.  There wasn't enough information about Laura's story and Amy's story wasn't finished.  I'm sure we will see them again in a future book, but it made this book a little scattered.I feel obligated to mention some topics included in the book in the interest of a balanced review.  Gardner includes topics such as drug addiction, alcoholism, homosexuality, and smoking in the book.  For example, Amy hires a homosexual choreographer for her theater production.  I can imagine that some readers would take offense to that.  Also, there is some drinking at the family's celebrations, which other readers might not agree with.  In my opinion, it doesn't detract from the book and I don't have a problem with it, but other readers of Christian fiction might.  Gardner treats all these subjects in a matter-of-fact manner, without promoting or attacking any view, but readers should be aware of the inclusion of the topics so they can make an informed decision about whether or not to read the book.Overall, I really enjoyed the book and can't wait for the next one to come out in the Fall of 2015!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"My favorite part of this book is the first section.  Maffucci spends a lot of time explaining how to select the best vegetables to spiralize and explaining how to do it.  I thought to myself that the company should have hired her to write the user's manual!The best part of this book for me was the idea of making ""buns"" out of compressed veggies.  It was a new idea for me, but one that I will definitely incorporate into our diets.  I also got a lot out of the ""rice"" dishes.It would have been nice to have a picture of each recipe.  As our family is making the necessary transition to gluten-free eating, some recipes would be automatically refused on the grounds of ""looking weird"".  It would be so helpful to look at the final product so that I could try the less ""weird looking"" ones first.I think this cookbook offers something for everyone who is wanting to eat more healthfully.  There is a nice range of recipes that would appeal to many different palates.

"I am a huge fan of Allison Pittman and have read her Sister Wives books twice, which is saying a lot since I usually don’t read a book more than once.  I was super excited to read this one, not only because I enjoy Pittman’s writing, but also because I was intrigued by the setting.  The only other book I have read that was set in this time period was The Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck, so I was excited to read a different perspective.This book was just ok for me.  It was a nice book, with an interesting plot and some nice characters.  However, I just couldn’t connect with Nola.  The affair between Nola and Jim was preventable on her part.  Jim did not actively pursue Nola.  I found it frustrating that Nola did not fight harder against the temptation of Jim.  I also found the relationship between Nola and her father confusing.  I can speculate why Pittman chose to have Nola behave in a forgiving way toward her abusive father, but it would have been nice to have Nola share her thought process.  Was it because she was honoring her father in spite of the past, or was it because she was hoping to have a closeness with him, or was it because she was unable to move beyond the abuse of the past despite the unconditional love of her husband?The themes of unconditional love and forgiveness that are woven through the book really make it worth reading.  Russ is the epitome of love, and when Nola finally confesses her affair, his reaction is real and understandable.  However, it creates another dilemma for me at the end of the book, because I would have liked to have read more of their relationship after the confession is made.  It ended a bit too abruptly for me.What makes this book the best for me is the descriptiveness, especially of the dust storms.  The lengths the townspeople go through to try to keep the dust out of their homes is amazing.  It really gave me an understanding of how difficult life in the dust bowl was.Overall, this book is a must read for any Allison Pittman fan.  It is different from any of her other books, which might make it better for some readers.  It just wasn’t my favorite book of hers.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"This book delivers a little bit of everything, a look into history, character lessons, action and adventure, interesting plot, and endearing characters.  It was a little slow for me at the beginning, but once Macy entered the picture, the rest of the book flew by!The best part of this book was how real it is.  Marlow demonstrates the closeness that the Carter family shares, but also shows how even close families can be affected by stress and difficult times.  Andi misses the companionship of her brothers while they are struggling with the rustlers, but readers see how the family pulls together in the end.Marlow cleverly intertwines the different plot lines without giving too much away too soon.  Some of it is predictable and readers might suspect what is coming, but not in a way that it is impossible to keep reading.  Some books readers can see the ending coming a mile away, but this one offers so many extras in the relationships with the characters that the predictability of the plot takes a back seat.This book is a solid choice for any tween reader that enjoys historical fiction and for any adult that wants to offer a tween reader a good book with solid values and character lessons.  It is even an entertaining read for adults!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"This book is a fascinating look into Iran's history and the resiliency of its people.  I loved the stories of how Iranians participate in home churches and how some of them develop, by a small group (sometimes two or three) of people that courageously approach someone and ask them to pastor them.  Bradley shows throughout the book that Iranians are starving for truth and light.I found it so interesting how people in different circumstances can view gathering together to learn about God and worship.  For example, sometimes church attendance in the US is viewed as something we need to do.  So we go, secretly hoping it is finished well before the football games start.  Compare that to secret church goers in Iran, where church services sometimes stretch on for hours, and the attendees are very thankful just to have an opportunity to go.  If only our country had that intense hunger and thirst for the Word!However, despite the rise of Christianity and home churches in Iran and the admission by one interrogator that if they arrested all the Christians there would be no room in the prisons, Iran continues to be a place where it is very dangerous to be a Christian.Overall, I found Bradley's book to be everything I wanted it to be.  I learned a lot about the history of Iran and the present day climate for Christians.  I appreciated that it offered a balanced look at life today for Christians in Iran.  It is true that their numbers are growing, but they face imprisonment and death for their faith.  If you are interested in learning more about Christianity in Iran, this book is a great choice!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"This was an easy to read and understand book.  It was a fast read, with a lot of interesting stories to keep it moving along.  Sometimes non-fiction books become a little dry for me, especially when they are bogged down with information.  Lawrence guards against boredom with his fresh writing and honest look at taking risks and the impediments to taking risks.Although this book was an easy read, I can't say that it offered a lot of new information.  That not to say that there isn't value in this book, just that I don't think there is anything revolutionary about it.  The most important thing that I look for when reading a non-fiction book is a moment where I think, ""Wow, I'm going to try that"" or when I am close the book and can't stop thinking about the ideas the author shared.  Even when writing this review, I find myself referring back to the book to recall specifics from it.  I usually don't have to do that, especially when the book is super engaging.Overall, this was an ok book for me.  I think a lot of readers would find it enjoyable, but I wanted more from it.  I was looking for it to inspire me to live on the edge and step out from my comfort zone.

"I have to confess that this is the first book I have ever read in my life solely based on a book review.  The review that I read of the book wasn't a positive review, but the review was so thoughtful and well-written that I had to read the book and see if I had similar thoughts.The description of this book does a really good job in enticing readers to enter into the mysterious world of Cal/Nicole/Nyelle.  I wanted to read the book just to figure things out.  Unfortunately, the mystery of the description is the most mysterious thing about the book.It is the character of Cal that carries this book.  I thought Donovan did a good job making him interesting to readers and depicting him in a way that made me care about what happened to him.  I didn't have that same kind of emotional attachment to the other characters.  However, the characters are what make this book readable.The plot is not great in my opinion.  It is a little frustrating because it could have been so much better with just some small changes.  Some parts were too detailed and dragged on, while other parts weren't detailed enough.  It made the book seem even more disjointed than it already is.  There was a sense of having an elephant in the room, where everyone is aware of it, but doesn't simply ask the question.  It would have been nice if at any point in the book Cal simply said to Nyelle, ""You remind me so much of someone I used to know.""Overall, it was an ok book.  Good characters, good setting, but It isn't one that I will rave about to my friends, but I finished it easily without having to force myself to read it all simply to review it.  I would be interested to read another book by Donovan, because I did enjoy the character of Cal so much.  I do think that young adults would probably enjoy this book more than I did, mostly because of the age of the characters.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Net Galley in exchange for my honest review.

"I loved the two previous books in this series, so I was super excited to read the latest installment of Tolsma's WWII novels.  I was particularly interested to read this because I had never read a book set in a Japanese internment camp in the Philippines.  I looked forward to learning a little bit about this facet of WWII.Tolsma delivered a lot of details about life in an internment camp that I found very interesting, such as prisoners hiring people to construct their huts for them and the economic system of the camp.  Readers can benefit from the historical value of the book and the extensive research that Tolsma obviously completed before writing the book.I thought the plot of the book was very interesting as well.  There were a couple of twists that took me by surprise, which isn't always the case with ""twists"".  Sometimes you can see them coming a mile away, but I was surprised.  I also always appreciate it when authors don't feel the need to make everything turn out happily for every character.  I like realistic conclusions, even when it is sad for a character sometimes.However, despite all the wonderful things this novel has to offer, I have to honestly say that it is my least favorite of the ""flower"" books by Tolsma.  I didn't click with the characters like I did with Cornelia and Gerrit in Snow on the Tulips and Gisela and Mitch in Daisies Are Forever.  I never felt emotionally invested in their survival, with the sole exception of Anita, Irene's aunt.  In my opinion, she was the strongest character.If you are a fan of Tolsma, like I am, you will probably want to read this book.  If you have read the other books in the series or are a fan of WWII fiction, you might not be able to resist.  It is a very nice book, just not a favorite for me.  I would recommend reading the other two books in the series first.  They aren't connected in any way other than the theme, but they are excellent books, where this one was just ok for me.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Book Look Bloggers in exchange for my honest review.

"I couldn't wait to read this book!  We recently became a gluten-free family by necessity, much like the authors family.  Gluten-free cooking and baking is a lifestyle change.  Fortunately, there are a variety of gluten-free commercial products available.  Unfortunately, they are usually twice the price of their counterparts.  My husband and I realized very early that it would be much more economical to prepare as much as we could from scratch.This book delivers everything that it promises, excellent gluten-free recipes made from real ingredients.  The best part is that the recipes call for ingredients that are readily available at the neighborhood health food store!  The recipes are a breeze to follow and the sidebars contain a lot of information, too.Far and away the section I liked the best was the beginning.  Cain spends the first 50 pages discussing the ins-and-outs of gluten-free baking.  I learned a lot about the role of gluten in baking and why different techniques and textures are necessary.  I also learned about different kinds of flour that I had never heard of before and certainly had never cooked with before!I think it would be great if all doctors' offices had a copy of this book to hand out to their patients when they deliver the news that gluten can no longer be a part of their diets.  It is difficult to leave the doctor's office and understand that you need to make a change, but have no idea where to start.  This book provides a solid foundation for making those changes.This is one cookbook that won't leave my kitchen shelves any time soon!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.

"I thought I would like this book a lot more than I actually did.  I had a really hard time connecting with the characters and the plot was fairly predictable.  It would have been nice to have a little bit more ""meat"" in the story.One of the things I was most curious about in the story was Abigail's father and why he left the family.  It was never revealed, which was disappointing.  It also seemed to me that Walsh included elements of conflict, trying to create tension in the book, without fully developing it.  Kate, Kelly, and Gwen's mother all had interesting facets to their characters, but it was almost like they were introduced too quickly and resolved too quickly.It isn't often that I put a book down while in the midst of it and then have to force myself to pick it back up, but this one I never felt that compulsion to finish it to find out what was going to happen.  I just didn't have that connection to the characters.However, I do have to say that on a positive note, the idea of the paper hearts is awesome!  What a great idea to keep your focus on the good qualities of your partner in the midst of trials and disagreements that pop up throughout the year.  I had never heard of the idea of writing positive things down on paper and then presenting it to your spouse on Valentine's Day.  It is a great idea on keeping the love and commitment alive year after year.If you love light romances that you can read without thinking about too much, this might be a good choice.

"This is such a fun book to read with young children.  The illustrations are bright, colorful, and hold the interest of youngsters.  Each page has several flaps to open and discover what is hiding underneath.

This book is perfect to instill a love of books from a very young age.I also like the sturdiness of the book.  The book and pages are as thick as a board book, and the flaps will hold up to a lot of opening and closing.

"This is an excellent cookbook for anyone who is looking to clean up their eating without following a strict diet plan.  I really appreciated the introduction to the book and Farrell explaining details and techniques about the recipes, especially with using oat flour and converting between oatmeal and oat flour.  I had a much better understanding of how the recipes would work when I was reading through them.The recipes were all easy to understand and follow and included nutritional information, which is a huge plus for me.  The best part is that most of the recipes included ingredients that I already had on hand in my kitchen.  Some of the ingredients that I didn't have, Farrell included ideas for substitutions, which was excellent!My favorite recipes were the ones that were suitable for one person.  Sometimes it is difficult to make 12 servings of a recipe when only one person will be eating it, depending on the item.  I also loved all of the recipes for muffins that could be frozen and eaten over several days.  It is a handy way to keep nutritious food available to grab quickly in the morning when you are running out the door!All in all, I thought this was a great cookbook that I will definitely hold on to.  If you are looking for a source of good, clean recipes, look no further than this book!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Book Look Bloggers in exchange for my honest review.

"This is unlike any other diet book that I have ever read.  Most diet books deal with plateaus by saying, ""They happen, keep following the plan and weight loss will start again.""  Well, what if you continue to be disciplined and nothing happens?  What if you are getting older and fighting hormonal changes and the natural aging process?  Haylie Pomroy offers a solution.The best thing about the eating plans put forth in this book is that are of short duration and very specific.  I also really liked the way Pomroy encourages readers to substitute vegetable for vegetable, fruit for fruit, etc. if you encounter something in the plan that you do not like.  I am a super picky eater, so it makes it easier for me if I have choices.The success boosters in the book are awesome.  Some I was already familiar with, but I learned a lot and tried some new ones.  I actually think they are the highlight of the book.The worst part about the plan is that it calls for a lot of ingredients that I didn't have on hand.  Pomroy is very helpful and provides readers with very specific shopping lists, but not all of the fruits/veggies are in season and are hard to find this time of year.  Living in Southern California, that is saying something.  Fortunately, I had some frozen zucchini in the freezer left from the summer.For the purposes of the review, I tried a variety of the teas, soups, and smoothies.  They are not delicious, I am not going to lie.  The soups are ok, but the teas and smoothies are not delicious.  However, I had a suspicion that they wouldn't be because in the book Pomroy suggests readers combine the tea with other things to make it more palatable.  I've been doing green smoothies for awhile now and still don't think they are delicious.  I still shudder when I pound them down each morning, but I don't drink them for the taste, I drink them for the health benefits.  It might help readers to focus on a benefit other than the taste for the teas!I can't speak to whether or not the plan helps you break through a plateau, since I am not currently experiencing a plateau.  I will definitely keep the book and try it out when I do though!Overall, I think this is a good resource for people with a lot of dedication to follow a precise plan.  I think that if someone is experiencing some of the symptoms Pomroy addresses in the book and has tried other options, there is nothing to lose by giving this book a try.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.

"I always find it a little difficult to review a Bible, but I love to read different translations and notes.  This is a large, weighty, hard-cover Bible that offers a lot to readers.  It always takes a little bit of time to become familiar with the set up of different Bibles.I thought the reference section in the back of this one was very thorough.  The maps were colorful and easy to read, the concordance was good-sized, and it offered a quick snapshot of bad news/good news to use in sharing the Gospel.  However, my favorite part of the reference section was a glossary of evangelism terms.  Wow!  It was very helpful and I even learned meanings of words that I have heard over and over, but was never quite sure what they meant!I especially liked the articles and commentaries scattered throughout the Bible.  I found them relevant and informational.  I also liked the suggestions given for where to encourage new believers to start reading.Overall, I thought this was a great Bible and a wonderful tool to use in sharing the Gospel.  If you are wanting to step up your efforts to share your faith with others, this is an excellent reference!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"This is a great book to carry with you in the car to read while you have a couple minutes waiting to pick up children from practice, or while waiting at the doctor's office.  Each reading is only a few pages long, but they really make you think and meditate on how you are living your life.I found that after I read, I would think about it for awhile.  I am not sure that there is any new information included in the book, but it does make you think about old information in a fresh, new way.  It has the benefit of taking verses that you are already familiar with (maybe too familiar with), and looking at them differently.  It is a good reminder of how we should live our daily lives.Medders writing style is engaging and down-to-earth, which always makes it fun to read a book.  Some of his anecdotes made me smile, but they all made me think.  This book isn't at all dry or discouraging, it is invigorating and uplifting.If you are looking for a short book filled with readings that will fill you in a short time, this is a great choice.  If you have more time, you can spend more time reading, but I found it perfect to read a section in the car and then spend the rest of the day thinking it over.  You could also use it as a structured devotional book and read a section each day.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"This is one of the best novels I've read in the last couple of months.  I couldn't put it down and finished it within four hours of when it arrived in the mail.  It isn't always the case that the book lives up to the description on the back, but this is one that does.It is a rare book that keeps me guessing to the end and equally as rare to find one where the subplots and secondary characters are as interesting as the main ones.  Again, Sproles delivers.  I also think she does a great job of describing life in the mountains.  I could easily imagine the setting, the challenges of survival, as well as the sense of community among the people of the Wadalow Mountain.The message and lessons in the book is also rewarding.  I loved the testimony of Samuel, Terrance, and Isabella as they loved Melody with their actions and demonstrated how to love and care for people, as well and being a living testimony for God's love in the face of Melody's despair and pain.  It is a reminder of how we should all minister to the least of us.This book delivers it all.  I think this book would appeal to many people, but be aware that some scenes of the abuse Mercy suffered or witnessed at the hands of her father are difficult to read.  I can't wait to read another book by Sproles.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"This collection of stories is sure to please the entire family.  Personally, I enjoy everything that focuses my attention on the meaning of Christmas, rather than the commercialization that marks the contemporary view of Christmas.  These stories harken back to times where people viewed the simple things in life differently.I can't say that I enjoyed each story equally well, but even the couple that I didn't love were so well-written that I appreciated the language.  The writing was so vivid and descriptive that I could imagine the settings as if I were there.  EaThe best part of this book was the glimpses into different cultures and people from around the world.  I also enjoyed the length of each story; they are perfect for reading aloud to children of all ages.  I can imagine re-reading this book each year at Christmas time and enjoying it more each year.  I can also imagine children loving the stories more each year as they are read and re-read.If you are looking for a compilation of Christmas stories that you probably haven't read before, this is it.  If you are looking for old-time stories, you will find them here.

"This is one of those rare romance books that I wasn't sure what was going to happen at the end.  I honestly didn't know if Jed and Rose were going to make it or not, and that made the book really interesting to read.  It actually isn't so much of the typical stories of guy meets girl, falls in love, and lives happily ever after as it is a story of the real-life struggle to maintain a marriage for a lifetime.The strongest part of this book is the characters and the relationship between them.  I felt like Fabry did a great job in making the characters easy to relate to and care about, even when we see them making mistakes and hating the choices they choose.  The facets of Jed and Rose's relationship can be seen in many households across the world on a daily basis, as well as the challenges that many women face of caring for their children and worrying about their parents at the same time.  It made Rose a very sympathetic character for me.The only criticism I have about the book is that the ending was too abrupt for me.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the process of recovery and seen the struggle of forgiveness.  However, my small criticism certainly wasn't enough to make me not enjoy the book.  This is definitely one of my favorite books by Fabry.If you haven't read Fabry before, this is an excellent one to start with.  It makes me want to see the movie and delve deeply into the book of Song of Solomon.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"This book is everything you could want in an instructional cartooning book.  The illustrations are clear and easy to follow and duplicate, even for someone who is not a natural artist.  The directions are broken down into step by step descriptions.  An added bonus is the commentary is humorous and adds to the light-hearted look at drawing cartoons.The best part about this book is that it teaches techniques for drawing that can be used in all future drawing projects.  For example, Hart advises artists to leave a gap between thumb and fingers when the hand in the cartoon is holding something.  Such a small detail, but it really makes a difference in creating realistic images.This book is appropriate for artists of all ages, as the cartoons are whimsical instead of scary and funny instead of sinister.  If you can draw a circle, an oval, and a square, you can duplicate the cartoons in this book.  If you are looking for a book to improve your artistic skills, or those of someone you know, this is an excellent choice!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.

"This is a beautiful book.  I was already a fan of Blumhardt, and this book does not disappoint.There are many things to like about this book.  First of all, I liked the way it was laid out.  The book begins in January, but I started reading it in November.  I've read other ""daily"" reading books where it was frustrating to navigate the layout and find the daily reading, especially if I had missed a day or didn't start at the beginning.  The layout of the book is one page for each day, so it was very easy to find just where I wanted to be.I also liked the brevity of each reading and prayer.  Sometimes life is too busy and when faced with adding another thing to the to-do list is overwhelming.  These prayers are so quick and short that they are perfect for the days when it is all you can do to spend five minutes in prayer, but also for the days when you have more time to meditate on the truths Blumhardt highlights.This is a great book to get for yourself or as a gift for someone you love.  I think it would be especially helpful for someone who is looking to commit to a more vibrant and committed prayer life, but doesn't necessarily know how to begin.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Plough Publishing in exchange for my honest review.

"I have read and enjoyed all of the Christiansen Family novels, but this one if far and away my favorite.  What isn't there to love about the Christiansen family?  They have always been a close-knit family that sometimes make mistakes, but pull together and everything comes out right in the end.  Sometimes they seem a little too good to be true, but they are fictional characters after all.However, in this book, readers get to see another side of the Christiansen family.  One in which the mistakes have a higher price and one in which there isn't a clear cut right way to resolve the problems.  In other words, a book in which the messiness of life shines through.  That is what makes this book so much better than the others.  It isn't neat.  It explores the messiness of life, with secrets and high-stake decisions that don't have easy answers.This is a great book, not only for the plot and the characters, but most importantly for the message.  Readers encounter sacrifice and real love - love that chooses to love, even when it is painful or inconvenient.  We read about people that put others before themselves and their wants.  It isn't always pretty, but it comes together into a wonderful book.If you've read the other Christiansen Family books, you won't want to miss this one.  If you haven't read any other books in the series, you can pick up this one and read Casper's story and then go back to read about the others.  Each book is strong enough to stand on its own.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"This is the first book of this kind that I have ever read, so it was very informative for me.  The topic of homosexuality is everywhere and it is difficult to know how to reconcile biblical mandates to love one another with alternative lifestyles.  Barr and Citlau offer a well-written book to help readers navigate the tricky waters.I was impressed with the logic presented in this book.  Whether you agree or disagree with what the authors' viewpoint, I think anyone could appreciate the logical arguments they put forth.  It isn't easy to write about such a hot button topic without becoming too emotional, but Barr and Citlau achieve it.The most helpful part of the book for me was the question and answer section at the back of the book.  I haven't experienced most of the situations personally, but I feel more confident about how to respond in a manner that would be pleasing to God.If you are interested in learning more about how to ""love gay friends without losing the truth"" this book provides a lot of information in a short, easy to read book.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"I thought this was a very interesting book, especially since it was written from someone who has spent time on both sides of the war.  I really appreciated the straightforward way McGuire wrote.  She didn't sensationalize spiritual warfare, but neither did she fail to convey the very real conflict.I enjoyed the questions at the end of each chapter.  It gave me a chance to review information from the chapter and personalize it.  I especially liked the ""Take Action"" section that gave ideas on how to put the information into practice.It does seem that a lot of the information McGuire shared is common to books about spiritual warfare, but what makes this book unique is that she shares her testimony and experience.  I've read several other books that stress the importance of putting on the armor of God, for example.  However, the section of common battlefields was really eye-opening.Overall, this is a really informative book that is a very quick read.

"This is not your typical Advent devotional book.  Each day challenges readers to recognize and embrace the true meaning of Christmas through the depth of the writings.  Obviously the authors of the compiled writings are gifted writers, with great minds.  Having all of the writings gathered together in one volume results in a very special book that will result in readers rejecting the commercialization of Christmas and gain a deeper appreciation of the momentous occasion that Christmas is.It is too easy to get trapped by the hustle and bustle of Christmas.  We are so busy shopping and decorating and cooking and cleaning that we don't take the time to reflect on what we are actually celebrating.  The writings in this book are a great resource to redirect our efforts into the true meaning of Christmas.Not only do we get distracted by the commercialization of Christmas, but it can also be an emotionally challenging time for some.  It is a stressful time of the year, and we need to take the time to reflect and give thanks for the greatest gift ever given.  This book helps with that as well.This is the book for anyone who wants to experience a Christmas with more meaning and appreciation than ever before.

"When I started reading this book, I couldn't believe it was Shrock's first novel.  It is a really, really good book for a debut novel.  Usually when a book arrives in the mail to review, I thumb through it and then put it at the bottom of the stack so that I read them in order.  When this one arrived, once I thumbed through it, I read it straightaway!  I couldn't put it down.This book has it all - the characters are interesting, the plot is intriguing and fast-paced, and the message is meaningful.  Obviously Shrock knows her target audience very well and captures the essence of teen angst.  The best part of this book is the character development.  Each character develops and changes throughout the book, but in a way that is realistic and true to the integrity of the character.  Even some surprises that are revealed about a character are believable.There really isn't anything I didn't like about this book.

"This is a very sweet and easy to read book.  The characters of Susan and Jim are easy to connect with and care about.  Despite being a romance book, it was not predictable, which is always a plus.

I think this book would be an amazing source of comfort and guidance to young women who are seeking a God-pleasing marriage.  The discussion questions at the end are thought-provoking and help guide young women.I also thought the supporting characters and story lines were equally compelling and interesting.

"I had already read the first two book in this series by Williamson, so I was excited to see what happened next to Levi, Mason, and the others from Glenrock.  It took me a few pages to fully immerse myself into the story and remember all the slang terms that Williamson uses in the Safe Lands, but once I did, I couldn't put the book down.This is definitely my favorite book from this series.  Williamson does a great job in bringing all the characters to a realistic conclusion, which I particularly appreciated.  The plot moves along very quickly and holds the attention of the reader throughout the book.  In this book, more than the other two, the Glenrock people take the opportunity to share their faith with the Safe Land people and the Below Grounders, which was nice to read.If you have read the previous two books in the series, this one is a must read.  I'm not sure how easy it would be for someone to pick up the storyline if they hadn't already read the other two.  The book really takes off running and the relationships between the characters aren't reviewed much, so it might be hard to enjoy this one without reading the other ones.I received a complimentary copy of this book from BookLook Bloggers in exchange for my honest review.

"After reading Hoffman's other book, Chia Vitality, I was really excited to read this cookbook to get ideas on ways to incorporate chia seeds and gel into every day eating.  This cookbook does exactly that.As far as cookbooks go, this one is not particularly large, but it does have a lot of recipes that are easy to execute, with ingredients that most people would have on hand in the kitchen.  I really like the flaps on the cover that readers can use as bookmarks.  It is such a small detail, but it helps with the overall user-friendly experience of the book.The only criticism I have about the book is that I wish it had the nutritional information broken down at the end of the recipes.  That would make the book more helpful to readers who are counting carbs or calories, or sugar.  I understand Hoffman doesn't really address chia seeds as anything other than a natural superfood, but I think a lot of readers want to know the breakdown of what they are eating.My favorite recipes are the ones for the smoothies.  I didn't make every smoothie, as described in the book, but adapted to use other ingredients I already had.  My other favorite part of the book is the instructions on how to make chia gel, specifically how to make different quantities of chia gel.  I'm not a very adventurous cook, so I really appreciate clear, precise directions.If you are looking for ideas on how to incorporate chia into every meal and snack, this book offers a wide variety of options.

Sometimes it takes awhile for a book to get to the ""hook"" where readers just can't put it down.  Finally, around page 100, my interest was piqued and I started to feel like I was at the point where I would be carving out time the rest of the day to finish the book.Sadly, the momentum did not continue.  I finished the book, but it was with the thought that I really didn't care if Carey and Nick figured out the mystery or not.  I had more interest in what would happen with Dimitri.  I thought a lot about why I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would and the answer lies in the characters, namely Carey.  Each character generated some interest in me, but it wasn't sustained.  The character of Carey was a little paradoxical - she was an orphan, who traveled halfway around the world only to discover that the place that hired her was now closed down due to the economic collapse of Greece, but she meets a friendly Greek family who instantly become her best friends.  Yet she is portrayed as emotionally detached due to a betrayal by her college sweetheart.  For me, it just didn't add up.  The character of Nick equally lacked integrity for me.  I was never clear on what caused him to be so callous and distant.Despite my criticism of the characters, I did enjoy parts of this book.  Bunn did an excellent job in bringing the headlines of the economic collapse in Greece to life for me.  I feel like I really got an understanding of the cost to the people of Greece.  I always enjoy books that help me to understand something that I've read or heard about elsewhere a little bit better.  Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make the book a winner for me.If you are a die-hard fan of Davis, you might enjoy this book.  If you are looking for a Davis Bunn book to read for the first time, I would probably recommend that you start with one of his others.  This one wasn't my favorite.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

"This book is the perfect size for small hands to hold and the cover has a nice ""puffy"" feel to it that appeals to kinesthetic readers.  The illustrations are great for providing visual stimulation and give children a lot to look at to make the story come alive.What I loved about this book is that it takes the story of the life of Jesus and uses language that is easy for children to understand while keeping the truth and the message and the meaning of Jesus's life intact.  That is not an easy thing to do, but Williamson executes it perfectly!I also enjoyed the way Williamson included references to the verses in the Bible where the information could be found.  It helps children make the connection between a bright and colorful book and the Bible.  The recommended age range of this book from 3 - 5 years is spot on, although I think younger or older children would enjoy it either for the illustrations, or for the story itself.I can imagine this is a book that parents and children would enjoy reading again and again.  If you are looking for an accurate book to introduce young children to the life of Jesus, this is an excellent choice!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"I love the bright and colorful illustrations throughout this book.  Each page offers a visually stimulating illustration related to the text.  The text itself winds its way through the pictures, which increases young readers interest in the words and pictures.  This book is great to read aloud to pre-readers, as the text is written in simple rhyming couplets and consists of the question about God's greatest gift.I read over this book myself before I read it with my son, so I knew the answer at the end was ""you"".  However, when reading it with my son, after the first question in the book about God's greatest gift he answered ""Jesus"".  When the answer was revealed at the end of the book, it led to an interesting discussion.  Without a doubt, God's greatest gift to us is Jesus.  However, for me personally, it was impossible to understand the depth of God's  sacrifice of His only son until I had children of my own.  My son is older than the target audience, so I'm not sure younger children would be able to participate in a discussion like that, but it might open the door to similar discussions.My favorite part of this book is the activity at the end where Burch challenges readers to find seven of one item in each illustration.  My son and I had a great time racing each other to see if we could be the first to find which item is replicated seven times.  Some of the pages were challenging!If you are looking for a bright, colorful book that would be an excellent read aloud for young readers, this is a great choice.  Sometimes it is difficult to find a book where the illustrations hold the attention of very young children long enough that the parent has enough time to read all the words on the page.  This book keeps the text simple enough that parents have enough time to read the text and then talk about the illustrations with their child.  That is a big plus in my mind!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Book Crash in exchange for my honest review.

"One of the reasons why I love reading historical fiction so much is because I always learn something.  I was really excited to read this book because I freely admit that my education was lacking about events in England in 1536.  I was impressed with the depth of information Vyner-Brooks included in the book and the way he brought the characters to life.  I learned a lot in the course of reading this book.When the book arrived in the mail, I was overwhelmed by the size of it.  It is a really long book!  I have to admit that I was completely lost at the beginning of it.  The story takes off and introduces a lot of characters in the first few pages and I found myself wondering who the important characters were going to be and what was going on.  Eventually it all came together and I was able to determine what was happening.  I probably would have enjoyed this book more if more background information was given at the beginning, but I freely admit that it was probably due to my ignorance of the time period and not due to any deficit on the part of the author!If you are a fan of historical fiction, you will love this book.  The length of it really gives you a chance to immerse yourself in the time period and in the lives of the characters so you really feel like you get to know them.  I recommend it for a long enjoyable weekend of reading while being curled up in front of a fire!I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.

"This is one of those non-fiction books that reads like a fiction book.  Smith shares her experience with the sudden loss of her husband shortly before Christmas and the struggle of keeping her family together.  It is a very poignant book to read in that your heart breaks for the family and their loss, but it is wonderful to read about the random acts of kindness and the way they help the family cope with the holidays.I really enjoyed the message of this book.  Sometimes it might seem like small, random acts of kindness don't make much difference, so it was nice to read about what a huge difference the small gifts made to the Smith family.  Although it was nice to read about the Smith family beginning to recover from their loss, my favorite part of the book was at the end when the mystery or who was leaving the gifts was revealed.  It made the whole book more emotionally meaningful for me.If you are looking for a great book that will help them focus on what really matters during the Christmas season should check this one out.  It will definitely remind you that family and serving others is far more important than the consumerism that has come to define Christmas.I received a complimentary copy from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.

"This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read!  The idea behind it is nice - photographer Galimberti traveled around the world and spent time with grandmothers from all over.  He talked with them and cooked with them and then photographed them in their kitchen or living area.I thought the recipes from all around the world were very interesting.  I can't say how many I will make, but I can definitely pin point one I won't.  I can't imagine eating caterpillars, although Galimberti shared that the recipe was delicious!The stories about the women featured in the book were nice and it was interesting to see what people around the world eat.  However, what elevated the book from interesting to amazing is the photographs!  I loved, loved, loved examining the pictures of all the women in their kitchens or dining rooms.  They were featured with materials they use in preparing their recipes and I found it fascinating to see the different labels on food products.  I was equally fascinated to see a bottle of 409 cleaner in the background of one of the pictures.It was nice to study the pictures of the women and imagine the stories that they might have to tell.  Some of the women were in their 80's, so it was mind-boggling to consider the changes they have seen in the world in their lifetime.The greatest thing about this book is that it is so much more than a simple cookbook.  For me, the recipes were a miniscule part of the charm of this book.  I find myself desperately hoping that Galimberti will do a follow-up book in the same format.  I would love to read another book similar to this one.I think this book would appeal to a great many people.  Whether you are interested in cooking, culture, history, or photography, this is an awesome book!

"This book takes so many twists and turns that readers have no idea where it will go next.  I tend to look more at characterization in books and how the author has developed the character, because so many books seem to have similar plot structure.  It can become a little predictable.  Sometimes, even if the plot is unique, it becomes easy to see what will happen next or at the conclusion.However, Healy gives readers everything!  A unique plot and interesting characters make up this surprising book.  I thought it was interesting how Healy dealt with the topic of mental illness and how Bipolar Disorder manifested itself in Misty's life and the affect it had on those around her.  The reactions of the other characters were very authentic and gave more weight to the seriousness of the condition.I'm not sure this is a book that I would read again, but I will definitely look for another book by Healy.  She does a great job with crafting realistic characters that struggle with real-life problems and make human mistakes and have to cope with the results of those mistakes.If you love books filled with plot twists and surprises, this is the book for you!I received a complimentary copy of this book from BookLook Bloggers in exchange for my honest review.

"I love the way this book gives young children the picture of the entire Christmas story in a way that is easy for them to understand.  I couldn't find a recommended age range for the book, but I think it would be excellent for Pre-K or K as a read aloud.  The best part of the book is that the illustrations are bright and colorful enough to hold the interest of young children, while being read to by someone older.  I also think the arrangement of the font is great.  I can easily imagine young children tracing the words with their fingers as it swirls around on some of the pages.I've read aloud my share of children's books to children of varying ages at the same time and found that the biggest challenge is keeping the youngest one quiet and occupied and listening so the older one can understand what is going on in the story.  The beautiful pictures help hold the attention so that the truth of the story can shine through.This is a lovely telling of the Christmas story that will introduce youngsters to the birth of Jesus.  They will learn of the shepherds and the wise men and how they traveled to see Jesus.  They will also learn of the angels that appeared to Mary and Joseph.  I love books like this where an idea is presented to children in a broad overview so that when they hear it again and again, they can add more details and a deeper understanding of what is happening.If you are looking for a book to read to introduce children to the story of Christmas this Christmas season, this is a beautiful choice.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for my honest review.

"This is such a vividly colored book that is great for children.  The illustrations cover the entire page, so youngsters can spend a lot of time studying the pictures.  The text is minimal, but that is ok sometimes, in my opinion.  Parents and children can spend time exploring the illustrations and speculating what special book contains all of Alby's favorite stories.The best part about this book is that it shows children (and reminds parents) that the Bible is a mulit-faceted book that has everything - action, drama, suspense.

"I have seen chia seeds in the health foods store, and had heard others talking about the nutritional value of incorporating chia into your diet, but I really had no understanding of how to do so.  This book was very educational for me.I really liked some parts of this book.  I thought the section explaining about why chia seeds are so good for us was very informative and well-written.  The best part of it was the recipes and how to incorporate chia seeds into your diet in a very easy and accessible way.  I've been searching for great tasting vegan salad dressings and I was impressed with Hoffman's explanation of how to use chia gel to thicken salad dressings in a healthier way.The least effective part of this book for me was the sections where Hoffman encouraged readers to take up yoga and meditation.  There were no pictures of the yoga poses, so I think readers with no experience with yoga would be hard pressed to replicate them.  I am also not personally interested in meditation and would have enjoyed more recipes.If you are interested in making positive changes to your lifestyle and are mystified about the hype around chia and want to learn more about the health benefits of chia, this is a great introductory book.

"Mr. Dollinger has written an excellent review of this somewhat pricey but very desirable set, so my comments will be limited to a few observations.First, a comment about Ormandy's reputation.  He was a hugely popular conductor during his lifetime as were many of his recordings for CBS, RCA and EMI.  Yet many critics wrote condescendingly of Ormandy and his ""fabulous Philadelphians"" on the grounds that his interpretations were too comfortable and his ensemble too facile  in their reputed virtuosity.  Well, I suppose some of Ormandy's recordings might bear out these critical stereotypes, but I have encountered very few in many decades of collecting.Second, this wonderful Beethoven cycle on offer from Sony Japan will do mcuh to counter these stereotypes.  True, those philadelphians play with fabulous surface sheen--you will never hear a more *ingratiating* Beethoven cycle than this.  But there is much more to these readings than just beautiful sounds--though I defy any listener not to be seduced by them.  Ormandy clearly understands classical style, and projects these works with a salutary restraint and shapeliness.  This is Beethoven (almost) entirely without bombast--though there is plenty of drama, majesty and exuberance where where called for.  Under Ormandy's direction, slow movements convey a very special purity and poise that few others have achieved.  Other conductors have brought more spontaneous abandon to first movements and finales; those in Ormandy's Third and Seventh could be more ""unbuttoned"" (to use one Beethoven's favorite descriptors).  But no Beethoven symphony cycle will satisfy on every count in every work.  I like to think of Ormandy;'s achievement in Beethoven as either ""Toscanini with heart"" or ""Bruno Walter with spine"" (no disrespect intended to either of those icons of the podium).  HIs interpretive stance is closer to Walter; but his tempos are closer to Toscanini--except in the Third and Seventh, as indicated above.Finally, I would like to encourage younger listeners to purchase this set in order to appreciate not only a conductor whose reputation has not always been as high as it deserves, but also a great American orchestra at its peak: sonorous, even voluptuous strings; diaphanous woodwinds; gleaming, rounded brass; spot-on percussion.  The Philadelphians were indeed a remarkable ensemble when these recordings were made in the 1960's. You will not hear a lovelier collective sonority anywhere--not even in Berlin and Vienna (though maybe in Amsterdam).  Sadly, this orchestra, though still first-rate, no longer sounds like this.  Thus I count this Beethoven cycle as something of an ""historical recording,"" irrespective of Ormandy's virtues (and they are many) as a Beethoven interpreter.The remastered sound throughout this set is superb.  The Japanese engineers have managed to tame the grainy highs and boomy lows of the original LP's without any loss of warmth or visceral impact.  Domestic CBS and Sony reissues of Ormandy's recordings never sounded this good.If you are looking for a ""basic library edition"" of the Beethoven symphonies there are arguably better options at lower prices:  Karajan/1963 (DG), Bernstein/DG, Szell/Sony or Böhm/DG would be by current recommendations.  And of course everyone should own at least one of the great historical sets--Toscanini/1939, Furtwängler in Berlin (Music and Arts) or in Vienna (EMI), and Weingartner (available in many incarnations); to these I might add Klemperer, Walter, Schuricht and Scherchen.However, if you are a more adventurous collector, and interested in assessing a previously under-rated cycle of great merit, splendidly performed and recorded, then give Ormandy a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GP6NT64UTZJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005J7CTPS#wasThisHelpful","R1GP6NT64UTZJ5","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My indefatigable exploration of great conductors has finally gotten around to Giulini.  I'm not quite sure why it has taken so long.  My only excuse is that the discographies of the most important figures are enormous, and the number of reissues outruns the amount of free time one has for listening.In any case, in this hundredth anniversary year of Giulini's birth, I have taken it upon myself to explore his recorded legacy in extenso, and this reasonably priced collection from DG Italia seemed like the place to begin.  Indeed, it has provided many ear- and mind-opening opportunities to appreciate this conductor's distinctive approach to his favored repertoire. Previously, I had known Giulini's work principally through recordings of opera and sacred music--his famous EMI studio recordings of Verdi *Requiem* and *Don Giovanni*, plus a couple of orchestral works (I have always loved his Vienna Symphony account of Bruckner's Second, now on Testament).  But these intermittent encounters could not have prepared me for the sheer magnificence of the performances anthologized in this collection.Where to begin?  Perhaps with my first impressions.  When I received this set, I wasted no time in sampling the Brahms cycle with the VPO--always one of my favorite ensembles.  The introduction to the Brahms first riveted my attention right away:  such sumptuous playing; such luminous textures; such shapely phrasing, such sensitivity to the music's inherent pathos!  Here is a conductor who knows where he is going and how exactly to get there.  These impressions persisted as I made my way through the Brahms cycle, though there were some moments of consternation as I became aware of Giulini's predilection (at least at this stage of his career) for deliberate tempos.  The finale of the Second, for instance, seemed to hang fire at first--though by the point of the triumphant coda I was convinced that this music can actually benefit from a more leisurely approach--as long as its architecture is so loving sculpted, as it is here.I moved on to the Bruckner recordings. Critical opinion has been mostly favorable concerning these, and I was eager to confirm or disconfirm this consensus.  All three works (7, 8 and 9) exhibited virtues similar to the Brahms: massive structures, affectionately if rather deliberately shaped, and the VPO once again responding with near perfect unanimity, luminous textures, and opulent tone.  I was reminded, up to a point, of von Karajan's late Bruckner recordings with this ensemble, which are also sensitively directed and gorgeously played.  Both conductors emphasize refinement of collective sonority and of detail, though I found Giulini to be somewhat more interventionist than Karajan. Giulini's readings of 7 and 8 are more intensely personal than Karajan's VPO accounts; but Giulini manages to evoke a purity or nobility of utterance that is quite unique.  I found Giulini's Ninth to be quite simply stunning.  Despite slow tempos in all three movements, he gets his ensemble to really dig in, and the results are quite harrowing in all three movements, but especially in the crushingly dissonant climax of the Adagio.Nearly all of the other performances included in this box are of a comparable excellence.  I have never heard the LAPO sound as passionately involved and as richly sonorous as in the Schumann *Rhenish* and two Ravel pieces.  Once again, Giulini provides sensitive shaping that never cloys and energize his ensemble to play with great abandon.  I also found the Beethoven Fifth hugely enjoyable--a majestic, but not over-dramatized account that seems to unfold effortlessly and with a sense of inevitability that are tremendously involving.  The Debussy and Mussorgsky were more enjoyable for the superbly colorful playing of the ensemble than for the interpretations, which, though unexceptionable, didn't seem particularly distinctive. The Chicago recordings  proved to be something of a revelation, if only because this conductor manages to elicit a lyricism borne upon a sweet and rounded sonority that is quite uncharacteristic of this ensemble during the Solti regime.  The Mahler Ninth with this ensemble, if not as devastating an account as Bernstein's with the BPO, or Klemperer's with the Philharmonia, nevertheless sounds the depths of the composer's swan-song while retaining a certain objectivity that keeps the sentiment from becoming maudlin.  Detail and structure are carefully balanced, too.  Once again, Giulini manages to convey a long-range vision while giving due attention to contrapuntal strands and orchestral balances.  The Dvorák ""New World"" seems less hackneyed than usual under Giulini's vigorous and supple direction.  Indeed, he makes this warhorse sound newly minted.I was less taken with the BPO recordings of the Beethoven Ninth and Frank d-Minor (with his tone poem ""Psyche and Eros"").  The Beethoven is certainly noble and beautifuly performed, but here the approach does seem too deliberate, though the finale is superbly sung and moves ineluctably toward a rousing coda.  The Frank has its moments of delicacy and charm, but sludge prevails, particularly in the first movement which has a harder time getting going than usual; the fault, however, is perhaps more the composer's than the conductor's (I am not a fan of this composer or of this work).Throughout this set I was impressed by the quality of the engineering.  All four ensembles are given luminous, wide-ranging and beautifully balanced recording, with plenty of visceral impact where needed.In sum, then, this collection, though not comprehensive--Universal has recently reissued Giulini's complete Los Angeles and Chicago recordings in attractive bargain boxes--gives an enticing overview of this conductor's special qualities.  In all of the works recorded here, he evinces a singular tone of voice--firm in conviction but gentle of utterance, given to introspection without maundering, affectionate without descending too far into sentimentality, deliberate without dragging the music out.  His earlier EMI recordings with the Philharmonia (which have also recently been reissued to mark the anniversary) are reputedly brisker and more direct, without any diminution of sensitivity.  So I am eager to hear them; that will be my next listening project.  For now, however, I can give this set a strong endorsement, despite the bulky packaging (old-style 4-CD jewel boxes contained in a flimsy cardboard case) and skimpy annotations in Italian only.Postscript:  Since I wrote this review, DG/Universal has released a huge trove of Giulini recordings, including most (but not all) of those included in the ""Art of Carlo Maria Giulini"" set.  The advantages of the newer reissues are that they include more repertoire, are organized according to the ensembles/nationalities this great conductor worked with (VPO, Los Angeles/Chicago, etc.) and are housed in space-saving cardboard boxes. Cost is low for each volume.  For these reasons, I recommend that potential purchasers of the set reviewed above consider these newer reissues instead.  Also, fans of Giulini should be aware that Warner/EMI has released Giulini retrospective collections, also in space-saving boxes.  These include all of the recordings made with English orchestras, the Chicago/EMI recordings, and Concerto repertoire (with distinguished soloists such as Perlman, Rostropovich, Starker and others). Finally, Sony has released a huge ""bargain box+ of Giulini's recordings from late in his career for that label.  An embarassment of riches here, as well as much duplication of repertoire.  If you don't fancy owning, say, three versions of Giulini conducting Dvorak's *New World* Symphony (albeit with three different orchestras), than exercise caution in ordering multiple Giulini boxes from different labels.  Also be aware that Giulini's interpretations became more personal, and slowed down considerably, as he aged.  For this reason I would recommend, particularly to the neophyte, the ""London Years"" volume from Warner/EMI as the best place to start in exploring this conductor's recorded legacy.  I would then go on to purchase one or more of the DG boxes (the America box is particularly fine, though I'm also partial to many of his VPO recordings, even if the tempos have begun to slow down markedly by the time he made them).  I wouldn't recommend the Sony recordings as a comprehensive collection, except to completists; rather, I would pick and choose among them,given that Sony has released most of them as economically priced single issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S30U09ATD2MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BEDSFG#wasThisHelpful","R3S30U09ATD2MW","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My personal quest to explore every known recording of this work--in search, perhaps, of the elusive ideal--has at last brought me to Giulini's late recording of the work for Sony.  Since its initial release, at full price, its critics have been numerous and its admirers few.  I can see why.  In an age dominated by period performance practice, whose protocols rightly demand rhythmic resilience, nonlegato phrasing, upbeat tempos, and a spirit of the dance, Giulini's languid, awestruck approach will seem not so much romanticized as just misguided.  Imagine Klemperer on valium.  Yet, should we always reject, a priori, an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, approach to a familiar work, if that approach elicits musically satisfying results, even intermittently?  Do our categories sometimes need flexing and stretching?Nearly everyone will admit that Giulini was a great conductor, and that his proclivity for carefully sculpted phrases, super-refined textures, and, with advancing age, deliberate tempos could yield revelatory results in Bruckner, Brahms and Ravel (to cite three salient instances.  Add to this mix Giulini's further proclivity for introversion--some call it ""spirituality""--and one might well ask whether this singular aesthetic might prove appropriate for getting to the heart of the musico-religious vision in what was apparently Bach's last will and testament as a composer of sacred music.My ears at very least, and more significantly my soul, tell me that this approach does uncover depths that other versions miss; while my intellect questions whether the results are musicologically appropriate and, more crucially, whether the obscuring of contrapuntal detail in Giulini's exquisitely blended textures could be anything other than just ""bad"" music-making.How can inappropriate musical exegesis be so deeply satisfying? So awe-inspiringly beautiful?  So attuned to one side of Bach's musical personality, while utterly oblivious to its other sides?I will leave it to adventurous listeners, who are urged to purchase and hear this wondrous recording, to ponder and perhaps resolve these paradoxes.  Let me add a few further incentives, however.  The solo singing in this recording is very good indeed.  Lovely voices, perfectly attuned--at least in this instance--to the value of what Giulini is asking of them (which involves, predictably, long-lined and beautifully sustained legato phrasing).  Keith Lewis's ""Benedictus"" is so gorgeously sung that it's worth the modest cost of this reissue just to hear.  The choral forces are large, and, as intimated above, textural clarity and precise diction yeild to vertical melding and long-range sculpting.  Yet the tone of the choir remains luminours, and the intonation steady, at all dynamic levels; moreover, they are capable of some of the most rapturously beautiful soft singing I have ever heard on record.  The instrumental ensemble plays with vigor and conviction throughout, despite some very slow tempos.  The wind and string obbligati are sensitively rendered: virtuosity in abundance, yet without a hint of showiness.But if I have described Giulini's interpretation as if it were a liability that one might endure for the fascination of the thing, then I have mislead my readers.  There are many positive virtues to Giulini's exposition of the work.  Not all of the tempos are inappropriately slow, and even where he takes a leisurely approach, the listener is afforded an opportunity to be borne up by the gentle ebb and swell of Giulini's effortlessly natural pulse.  Moreover, Giulini never lets the music just drift along; he always knows where he is going.  The end if each movement, and the place of each episode within the entire structure, is prefigured from the beginning.  Listen carefully, and you will find--to change the metaphor-- that Giulini's B-Minor Mass is a living, breathing organism bound together by tougher sinews than might be at first apparent from the sheer lovelines of its diaphanous surfaces.This is, then, a version to hear--but not for everyone.  Perhaps one could say that it is version of Bach's B-Minor Mass looking for certain listeners who might be attuned to Giulini's distinctive qualities as an interpreter of sacred music.  If the prospect of an unhurried and reverent musical contemplation of the Eternal appeals to you, then seek out this modestly priced recording.  The engineers have captured Giulini's distinctive vision with wide-ranging, exquisitely blended sound, despite the opacity of texture that occasionally obscures detail in the polyphonically dense choral movements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUTEQ19TUA9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TX27J4#wasThisHelpful","R1KUTEQ19TUA9L","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not mean to derogate from Sir John Eliot Gardiner's status as one of the great luminaries of the podium in our age--to say nothing of his status as a pioneer and perfecter of period performance practice--but in the end the capstone of his career might well turn out to have been in the medium of prose rather than musical performance!  This is, quite simply, the most fascinating, engrossing, erudite and stunningly written work on the Leipzig Cantor available.  Too bad it focuses primarily on his sacred music (I would love to have Gardiner's obiter dicta on many of the keyboard, chamber and orchestral works treated only tangentially here); but within that  limited scope, Gardiner has achieved something quite remarkable:  a work of musical historiography that manages to combine rigorous scholarship with philosophical acumen and literary flair.  As a philosopher with a keen interest in the interface between aesthetics and religion, I particularly appreciated Gardiner's thorough understanding of the exigencies of church music within the Lutheran tradition, and his situating of tht tradition within the larger framework of Church history, scriptural exegesis and Christian spirituality.  His effort to discern Bach's character and aspirations from his church music rather than principally from the documentary evidence (which is relaitvely meager) fixes the reader's (and listener's) attention where it must always begin and end--namely, with the scores themselves, as performed and heard.  His charting of Bach's creative development, through the seasons and struggles of his career calls our attention anew to the status of the sacred music--particularly the Cantatas--as a kind of spiritual journal recounting the consolations and desolations of a fragile, fallible genius who also happened to be something of a mystic.  For Gardiner, in the end, Bach's sacred-musical testament amounts to the bravest and most brilliant of stands against the depredations of our human condition at its most terrifying--and *for* the transcendence to the rapture of creativity fitfully but effectually points.I cannot recommend this work highly enough.  Its pages will afford a fresh encounter with the composer, even if you have been studying his works and his commentators (as I have) for nearly a lifetime.  But even more tellingly perhaps, you will encounter John Eliot Gardiner in a new way--as an accomplished writer and winsomely humane scholar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NOZ4UZJ0WPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375415297#wasThisHelpful","R14NOZ4UZJ0WPH","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What more need be said?  This estimable series has gone from strength to strength, and the final volume transcends even the highest expectations.  All three cantatas are among Bach's most stunning creations (BWV 30 was singled out by Schweitzer in his study of Bach as a work of astonishing strength and originality), and the performances are nothing short of revelatory.  The four soloists are fully up to their tasks--and what demands Bach places upon them, particularly in BWV 30.  But everyone seems to be in a state of grace here--the vocal ensemble, instrumental soloists, and of course the director, Masaaki Suzuki. A sense of euphoria pervades all three Cantatas. Now that this project has reached its end, Suzuki must be acclaimed as one of the great Bach interpreters of his, or any, generation.  There are other superb Bachians--contemporary listeners are living a charmed existence in this regard--but on the evidence of the music-making in Vol. 55 (as in most of the previous volumes of the series), Suzuki has emerged as primus inter pares.  I also find it appropriate that Suzuki chose to conclude the final volume with the cantata that recapitulates music from the Gloria of the B-Minor Mass.  Yes, indeed: Gloria in excelsis Deo!  May Maasaki Suzuki be blessed--as who have been following the series have been  blessed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQNIRUG0C9FK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW62C9K#wasThisHelpful","RFQNIRUG0C9FK","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a great admirer of the Bethlehem Bach Choir--to whom all Bachians in the USA owe a huge debt of gratitude--I had high expectations for this recording of my personal favorite among Bach's large-scale sacred works (though it really is a cycle of six cantatas). Though I was impressed by many aspects of this production, overall my response was one of mild disappointment.  Among the virtues I would count the sprightly, expressive and stylistically aware playing from the ad hoc orchestra.  The wind and brass playing were particularly impressive; the strings (modern instruments playing with minimal vibrato) somewhat less so. Funfgeld has a solid grasp of Bach style and conveys an unusually cogent understanding of the score through his judicious pacing and insightful highlighting of detail. The arias, in particular, are vivacious, with dance rhythms well sprung. On the other hand, some of the big choruses could have benefited from more upbeat tempos, but the large choir would have made that impracticable. The soloists are fine, particularly the alto and soprano; both sing with expressive attention to textual detail and a decent knowledge of Baroque ornamentation and phrasing.  The tenor, Benjamin Butterfield, has a pleasing voice and  narrates effectively, though his negotiation of the difficult tenor arias is considerably less fluent, and his tone overall less pleasing, than his better-known recorded rivals.  The bass has a gorgeous voice but at times has problems with German pronunciation (as do all of the other soloists as well as the choir).  Speaking of the choir, their contribution was most of all responsible for my mild disappointment. They are simply too large a group to bring the requisite precision and lift to the articulation of rhythmic cells (so important in Bach). The more densely contrapuntal passages can also sound a but mushy, despite the conductor's efforts to clarify voice-leading.So, regrettably, I have to give this worthy release fainter praise than I would have liked.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the many truly great versions of this work on record--from Richter and Münchinger to Gardiner and Suzuki.  This work's discography has been particularly blessed over the decades, and better performances are available now at reduced prices. However, I will end on a positive note.  It is still worth hearing a choir and orchestra that continue to uphold the best traditions of Bach performance for well over a century; and it is important to acknowledge and appreciate the existence of such traditions on these shores.  Indeed, there's a point in purchasing a recording of the *Christmas Oratorio* that sports a ""made in the USA"" label.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTWLZOA2T664/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JLL2#wasThisHelpful","RVTWLZOA2T664","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ormandy's recording of the Mahler First is certainly one to consider if you want to hear the composer's original five-movement conception, with ""Blumine"" occupying second place between the first movement and the Scherzo.In my estimation, however, that is not the main reason to purchase this inexpensive reissue (""Blumine,"" though charming, doesn't really add anything of substance to the symphony as we usually hear it); rather, it is for the terrific playing of the Philadelphians under their longime maestro, Euegene Ormandy.  Ormandy may not the the first conductor that comes to mind in relation to Mahler, but on the basis of this delightfully atmospheric and dramatically compelling rendition, Ormandy's traversal must rank with the finest of rival versions.  Though Horenstein/LSO still retains a unique place in nearly every Mahlerite's affections, Ormandy/Philadelphia is just as cogent as interpretation and superior in execution. The remastered recording is overwhelmingly clear and present, with plenty of ""air"" around the instruments.  Antiphonal passages come through enghantingly.I have to admit to being blown away by this recording, which I hadn't previously heard despite my decades-long obsession with this composer and his many interpreters.  The Von Stade/Davis rendition of the *Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen* has been added as a substantial bonus.  Though von Stade is in fine voice, and Davis provides sensitive collaboration, this version cannot rival the classic ones--Ludwig, Baker, Fischer-Dieskau in my book--for depth of insight into the youthful Mahler's romantic preoccupations and existential crises; but it an effective accountm, well worth hearing.Strongly recommended to seasoned Mahlerites and first-time collectors alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUBDGMSAAHP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EHQ8G4#wasThisHelpful","R2KUBDGMSAAHP0","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the penultimate volume in Suzuki's magesterial series of Bach cantata recordings.  The final volume will contain three works--BWV 30, 69 and 191, all glorious.  I can hardly wait.  For now, we have this terrific volume to consider and enjoy. The three canonical Cantatas and one reconstructed work it presents make for a nicely contrasted program.  BWV 100 is arguably the jolliest among Bach's works in the genre.  It consists of a series of arias loosely based on a magnificent chorale tune; these are framed by a lavishly orchestrated chorale fantasia and a concluding harmonization of the hymn reinforced with winds, strings and continuo.  BWV 14, on the other hand, is a sober, introspective work sporting an opening chorale fantasia that rivals *Die Kunst der Fuge* in its contrapuntal intricacy.  BWV 197 is another one of those splendid wedding cantatas with lavish orchestration and expansive, well-developed arias.  It begins with a stunning fugal chorus, crowned with festive trumpets, that resembles the equally magnificent opening of BWV 195. Thereafter the listener is astonished ever anew by the fecundity of Bach's creative resources; all the more remarkable, then, that these resources are brought to bear on a one-off wedding ceremony.  The disc concludes with a reconstruction of BWV 197a, a sacred cantata based on the wedding cantata, but with significant alterations in orchestration and melodic detail.A real feast for earnest Bachians, then, and I am pleased to report that the performances are fully equal to these demanding works.  The choral singing, as with recent volumes in the series, sounds fuller, richer and riper than many of the earlier volumes in the series--yet with no diminution of clarity or focus.  Indeed, I have never heard more intensely satisfying accounts of the very different opening choruses of BWV 100, 14 and 197.  The latter approaches a grandeur that does full justice to Bach's sublime evocation of heavenly-earthly joy (Bach, a good Lutheran was never one to reinforce a sacred/secular dualism), in a way which we rarely encounter in ""period"" performances. The solo singing is splendid; once again, I must remark that Peter Kooij's ample voice sounds rejuvinated in these later volumes of Suzuki's catata series.  Blazkikova remains the very model of a Bach soprano.  Türk and Guillion are perhaps slightly less effective in their solos, but that may be just a subjective reaction on my part:  I have always found Türk's voice a bit thin in tone (despite his solid musicianship), and I must confess to a preference for female altos over countertenors (though Guillon is thankfully not too hooty).As always, the Bach-Collegium Japan covers itself in glory.  The ensemble and solo playing are splendidly incisive and articulate, yet without slighting expression.  Suzuki's pacing and shaping of the music are near-perfect.Strongly recommended, then, along with Suzuki's entire cantata cycle, now nearing its completion. Listeners new to the Bach cantatas or to Suzuki's readings of them might well start with this volume and work backwards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GH2OQQTP0LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSZCA7K#wasThisHelpful","R16GH2OQQTP0LS","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This companion volume to Warner's newly-reissued set of Werner's Bach Cantata series is somewhat less recommendable than the latter.  To begin with, most collectors who incline toward or at least tolerate ""traditional"" approaches to Bach will already have multiple versions of the two Passions, the B-minor Mass, and the Christmas Oratorio by their favored artists.  Secondly, the deficiencies of interpretation and execution which were easier to ignore in the case of the Cantatas become more problematic in the case of these larger-scale works (and in comparison to versions by such figures as Richter, Münchinger, Klemperer, Jochum and many others).  On the other hand everything in this box is at least listenable, often very enjoyable, and at its best, quite edifying.  The finest performances here--such as the two Passions--are very good indeed, largely thanks to some terrific solo singing by such estimable Bachians as Helmut Krebs, Agnes Giebel, and Barry McDaniel (among others). On the other hand, there is also some less satisfying vocalism, mostly from Franz Kelch, whose wobbly tone and stentorian delivery undermine his efforts to portray a dignified Christus, but also from some alto soloists of a matronly Teutonic persuasion.  On the other hand, the choral singing in both Passions is nicely focused, mostly in tune, and effectively dramatic.  Werner's pacing of these works, though slower than we would expect today, is lively where it needs to be and contemplative where appropriate to text and affect. Werner's Christmas Oratorio enjoys a more intimate and lyrical conception than most other versions I have heard.  Listeners may be put off by a relative absence of exuberant celebration, though I find that Werner's thoughtful and somewhat introverted approach works well on its own terms.  The solo singing, once again, is outstanding, led by Krebs's elegant and engaging narration. The choral sound here is more diffuse, less articulate than in the two passions, but nicely balanced and more than acceptable overall.  The B-minor mass comes in a monaural concert recording from 1957. The performance has moments of majesty, though with slow overall pacing and a monumental conception realized unevenly by forces that sound amateurish and under-rehearsed, it may strain the endurance of even the most patient listeners.This box also includes gracious accounts of the Six Motets (plus the great funeral motet BWV 118), effectively paced and well sung, and sporting ample instrumental reinforcements.  A thoughtful, if rather sober account of Cantata BWV 147, in decent monaural sound, is thrown in for good measure; for some reason, this recording did not make it into Werner's cantata Box, presumably because a later and more lively stereo version was included therein.The recordings have come up well in the current remastering.  The St. Matthew Passion fares best, with an ample ecclesiastical acoustic adding helpful reverberation that does not, however, compromise focus.  The acoustic is a bit drier in the St. John and more diffuse in the Christmas Oratorio, though both sound reasonably clear and present if the volume is given a slight boost.  The monaural sound in the Mass is faded and rather strident at times; not pleasant to listen to for long stretches.  The recording of the Motets, on the other hand, conveys both clarity and presence.Should you purchase this set as a companion to Werner's Cantata collection?  That will depend on your tolerance for performances and engineering of more variable quality.  While you probably won't listen to Werner's B-Minor Mass more than once, I expect you may return in due season to the two Passions, which are quite involving and beautifully sung.  The Christmas Oratorio and Motets are certainly worth hearing from time to time, as alternatives to your favorite versionsd which they will not, probably, replace in your affections.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CJUCZ2X6KEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD8SK0O#wasThisHelpful","R27CJUCZ2X6KEM","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fritz Werner belonged to a generation of ""specialist"" conductors that emerged after World War II in response to a renewed interest in Baroque music and stylistically aware performance practice.  Other distinguished members of that generation were Karl Richter, Karl Ristenpart and Felix Prohaska (to name just a few).  This movement was eventually overtaken by the turn toward what we know today as ""historically-informed performance practice"" that utilizes period instruments and the latest results of musicological research.  Listeners of an older generation, who lived through this momentous transition, will have retained a deep affection for those ""specialists"" of the early-LP era who devoted their musical careers to restoring to currency scores that had long-since lain mute on the shelves of dusty libraries--including, of course, the majority of Bach's cantatas.  Since then, of course, Bach lovers have been the beneficiaries of several more-or-less ""complete"" recorded editions of the Cantatas, by Rilling, Harnoncourt-Leonhardt, Koopman, Leusink, Suzuki and Gardiner.  May they all be blessed!  But the distinctive, if more selective, efforts of that earlier generation  deserve to be heard and enjoyed for their many virtues, even if by today's standards their limited notions of performance practice achieved, at best, mixed results.Fritz Werner's cycle of 60 Bach cantatas occupied that conductor from the late 1950's to 1972.  During this time he also recorded all four of Bach's large-scale sacred works as well as the Motets (and these, like the Cantatas, have been reissued several times by Erato and, latterly by Warner, during the CD era).  Despite vicissitudes of a largely amateur choir and (at limes) less than cohesive chamber orchestra, and regardless of the musicological limitations mentioned above, Werner's achievement as an exponent of Bach's sacred music was considerable, and has permanent value for listeners of every generation.  Werner's approach to this repertoire is, at its best, full of grace--by which I mean a certain graciousness, humility, generosity of spirit, and a plainspoken honesty that aims not to impress the listener with feats of virtuosity, but to serve the composer's intentions as he understood them.  Werner was a dedicated musician and Bachian who clearly enjoyed what he was doing, and that enjoyment by and large comes across in this venerable recordings.The qualifiers in the above paragraphs must be duly noted.  Werner did not achieve with the modern instruments of his Pforzheim Chamber Orchestra the degree of precision and cohesiveness evoked by Karl Richter from his Munich Bach Ensemble.  Werner's strings can sound seedy at times, and there are occasional lapses of ensemble and intonation.  On the other hand, the wind and brass playing are outstanding (the roster of soloists contains some very distinguished names, mostly from France).  The Heinrich Schütz choir, as indicated above, was not a super-professional ensemble.  Again, intonation and ensemble can sometimes be wayward.  However, their tone is characteristically light and transparent, and their diction is good (though not quite up to the awesome standards set by Richter's Munich Bach Choir).  It is the solo singing, in my estimation, that lifts this enterprise from the tolerably good to the memorable, and gives Werner's Cantata series its enduring value.  Nearly all of vocal soloists have light, attractive voices; they sing Bach's demanding arias expressively and idiomatically (within the limitations of stylistic understanding of that generation).  Agnes Giebel, Helmut Krebs, Barry McDaniel--to cite only three of Werner's distinguished roster of soloists--give some of the most memorable performances of their respective arias (and duets) ever recorded--and I am not excluding for comparison Richter's equally distinguished group, nor that host of vocalists that have graced the complete cycles of Rilling, Harnoncourt/Leonhardt, Koopman, Leusink, Suzuki and Gardiner.Werner's interpretive stance, as indicated above, emphasizes simplicity of utterance over searching out hidden theological meanings (a la Richter and Gardiner).  He avoids making music that is already polyphonically complex and melodically ornate into something imposing, garish or merely decorative.  He favors clean textures, moderate tempos (they will seem to slow to younger listeners brought up on today's early music ensembles), and lifted but not jerkily sprung rhythms.  The phrasing is generally smooth and legato, with a nicely inflected sense of line. Do not expect rhythmic cells to be articulated in the detached way we have come to take for granted in period performance practice. The expressive qualities of the music emerge effortlessly and naturally, without underlining or italicizing.  This approach can at times seem a bit dull, though if one will more often than not find it engaging as long as one is willing to appreciate a style of performance very different from what we have recently come to expect.  I have enjoyed Werner's Bach recordings for decades--through various incarnations on LP and CD--and I expect that unbiased listeners willing to follow Werner's Bach in the unglamorous ""slow lane"", so to speak, will be richly rewarded.  It is to be hoped that this latest, and relatively inexpensive, reissue of this material from Warner will inspire a new generation of listeners willing to revisit and retrieve the distinguished contributions of these early-music pioneers who did so much to revive great music that had hitherto remained obscure--such as the Bach Cantatas.Since I already own the previous Warner/Erato reissue of Werner's Bach recordings, I cannot comment on the sound quality of this new edition.  The sound, on LP and earlier CD incarnations, was always good, though with a hint of overload at higher dynamic levels (more noticeable in the arias than choral movements).  I strongly recommend this volume, and its companion (containing the Passions, Christmas Oratorio, B-Minor Mass and Motets), to collectors of all ages and persuasions; these recordings will afford much edification--and more than enough aesthetic food for thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIMLL4NIIP6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD8SK72#wasThisHelpful","R2IIMLL4NIIP6M","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a Haydn enthusiat, then by all means consider purchasing  this superb collection of 79 Haydn symphonies performed by one of the premier period-instrument ensembles at the height of their collective powers under Chris Hogwood.  It is a shame that Universal/L'Oiseau-Lyre apparently abandoned this project to record all 108 Haydn Symphonies before it reached completion. To date there has been no integral recording of them on period instruments.  However, if the listener is willing to supplement Hogwood's incomplete cycle with other recordings of nos. 76-93, 95, 97-99 and 101-103, a complete collection of Haydn symphonies can be assembled.Hogwood's approach to Haydn is brisk but not breathless, bracing but not fierce, elegant but not mincing, scholarly but not pedantic.  The AAM plays splendidly throughout (the natural horns, for which Haydn often wrote excruciatingly difficult parts in his early-to-middle period deserve special commendation).  Hogwood and his band are always aware of the shifts in idiom and style that occur not only from one period of Haydn's career to the next, but often within a single work!  Was there a style that this astonishingly resourceful composer had not mastered--Baroque, Galant, ""Sturm und Drang,"" High Classical and even proto-Romantic? Though not always a ""period performance"" enthusiast, I find the AAM's spare ensemble sonority (presumably what Haydn would have had at his disposal in Esterhaza) and resultant chamber-music textures delightful, particularly in slow movements. I also applaud Hogwood's decision not to employ a harpsichord (or other) continuo; it is not needed, and its incessant clatter would prove quite distracting over the long haul of this very expansive symphonic canon.  Textures emerge clearly, and often with fetching delicacy, without any reinforcement from a keyboard instrument.  Hogwood favors taking all repeats, even those in the recap of the Minuets; some listeners may find this too much of a good thing, but this was the scholarly protocol Hogwood adhered to.Despite occasional interpretive misfires, this is as consistently satisfying a HIP traversal of the bulk of Haydn's symphonic output as you will find.

If you have the means, however, this edition should prove either an invigorating introduction to these works or an invaluable supplement to whatever other Haydn recordings you have in your collection.

"Despite his reputation as a martinet and as a cold, cerebral perfectionist, George Szell made a huge number of splendid recordings during his long career as music director of the Cleveland Orchestra.  In fact, an attentive audition of the contents of this massive, 49-CD mega-box reveals a musician that was not only in total control of his craft--and his ensemble--but also an unfailingly imaginative, insightful, and elegant interpreter of the standard repertoire.  Hearing these classic recordings, one is not only riveted by the intensity of Szell's music-making with the Clevlanders, one is also frequently surprised by how affectionate Szell's interpretations could be.  Indeed, if one is prepared to listen objectively, the stereotype of Szell as ""all head and no heart"" will be repeatedly dis-confirmed.There is far too much repertoire included in this massive box to give an exhastive commentary in in a brief review.  Other websites give specific information about content.  I will only mention a few specifics.  First, the megabox in question was produced under the auspices of Sony in South Korea.  There may be other incarnations of ""Szell: the Edition,"" but this is the one to get: it is housed in a beautifully designed, and user-friendly, box.  Great care has gone into its production: each cardboard sleeve not only provides the usual information, but also has a plastic ""inner sleeve"" to protect the CD further from the rude shocks of mortal existence.  Perhaps this design was intended to evoke nostalgia--and boost sales--among LP-collecting baby-boomers. A fairly useful booklet is also provided, with track listings and an appreciation of Szell's artistry in Korean and (poorly translated) English.  Original recording dates are given, but no indication of when, where and how the digital remasterings were done.  The sound, however, is very good indeed--vivid, richly textured, with a warm Severance Hall ambiance to mitigate any chilliness in the interpretations (rare, in any case, as I have indicated above).  Are these the same remasterings Sony used for the Essential Classics and Masterworks Heritage series?  Perhaps, though some of the repertoire included in the box (Bartok's *Concerto for Orchestra*,Janacek's *Sinfonietta*, Rossini Overtures, etc.) have not previously appeared on CD--at least to the best of my knowledge. I didn't have any previous incarnations of this material on hand for comparison (having sold my entire Szell CD collection in order to obtain this box), but if my non-audiophile ears are any judge, the sound is mostly better than on any previous CBS or Sony reissue--indeed, often startlingly realistic.  But I may be imagining things--so take my remarks with a generous helping of skepticism.  It may also be that some of the ""helpful"" reverberation has been added electronically; if so, this listener regards the results as a distinct improvement over the slightly dry acoustics on many Szell/CBS LP's and earlier CD's.Some peculiarities are worth mentioning. This is, of course, not the complete Szell discography for CBS/Sony. I have no problems with that: a judicious representative collection may be what most Szell aficionados would want in any case.  However, it seems odd that such a massive retrospective of this great conductor's career would omit some of his best-known recordings.  Why, for instance was Szell's live recording of Mahler's Sixth included, but not his great studio account of the Fourth (one of his greatest efforts and universally commended by critics)?  Why include just one of Szell's numerous concerto recordings with Fleischer (Mozart's no. 25), and none of his collaborations with Serkin or Casadesus?  Yet the Mozart Clarinet Concerto and Strauss Horn Concerto no. 1 *are* included? Another oddity concerns the distribution of works per CD.  Some of the CD's are well filled (corresponding to previous reissues, or at least adding up to a respectable 60+ minutes of music); others, however, are astonishingly skimpy, such as the disc that contains only Beethoven's Eighth Symphony.  Why the Seventh and Eighth Symphonies couldn't have been combined on a single CD is a mystery to me.  There are many cases in which some of the well-known Szell recordings omitted in this collection could have been easily accommodated as a pairing with a given work.  There would have been plenty of room to accommodate at least some more Fleischer-Szell concerto recordings, or that great Mahler Fourth.  Granted, these recordings are readily available elsewhere, but it would seem ludicrous not to include them in this set given some of the skimpy playing times.Though I cannot comment in detail on the repertoire included in this box, suffice it to say that it is indeed representative of Szell at his best.  The Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven (including mono and stereo versions several Mozart symphonies) are all outstanding performances. I hadn't heard the Beethoven cycle for many years, but this time I was struck by the delicacy of certain phrasings and textures that Szell manages to evoke from his ensemble.  Though there is plenty of heaven-storming Toscaninian drama, Szell manages to convey a chamber-music intimacy to some of the more lyrical passages that I found both moving and surprising.  The Schumann and Brahms cycles (both complete) successfully combine classical clarity of structure with romantic warmth of expression.  His Dvorák Symphonies 7-9 are among the most exhilarating--and idiomatic--renderings of these  works available. Many listeners may be astonished at the sensitivity and luxuriant warmth of Szell's Richard Strauss tone poems; there are no finer versions than his of the four included in this box.  Szell's Mahler and Bruckner are also outstanding.  If the version of Mahler's Sixth included here doesn't quite evoke the terror of Bernstein or the searing intensity of Metropoulos--and one regrets the omission of the exposition repeat in the first movement--it nevertheless manages to communicate communicates a sense of tragic inevitability and (in the Andante) yearning for deliverance. I have a special fondness for Szell's Bruckner; he was one of the few conductors who could elicit an authentic Brucknerian sonority from an American orchestra. Some of his tempos might be considered controversial (the slow and rustic Scherzo in his account of the Eighth is a good example), as will his choice of Editions, but on the whole Szell probes more deeply into the dark corners of these works than Jochum, Haitink, Chailly, Barenboim, Böhm and any number of more renknowned Brucknerians.  The Twentieth-Century repertoire is also splendid: an incisive and classically-proportioned Bartok *Concerto for Orchestra*, robust and delightfully subversive Hindemith *Symphonic Metamorphoses*, and searingly intense Walton are among the highlights for me.Incidental caveats aside, this remains a highly desirable set for admirers of the conductor and collectors who would like to discover why Szell and the Clevlanders earned such a high reputation among concertgoers and critics during their long collaboration. Szell really did build the best symphony orchestra in the USA during his tenure, and his many recordings constitute a remarkable testament of music-making at the highest pitch of excellence--at times approaching as close to perfection as is humanly possible.  A strong endorsement, then, and an admonition to purchase this set while it is available; my guess is that its currency might be brief.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388P5BFVVLXFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BANCWSO#wasThisHelpful","R388P5BFVVLXFY","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This box contains Brendel's first Mozart cycle, with Marriner and the Academy, expertly remastered and offered in the bargain-basement price range. As such it is excellent value, despite skimpy notes (in German).  Brendel's way with Mozart is well-known and often celebrated.  Not for him the expressive nuances of Perahia, Uchida or Barenboim.  Brendel's Mozart is vigorous, plainspoken and, at times, a bit prosaic.  In compensation, however, the listener gets a non-interventionist, but always stylish, reading of Mozart as near as possible to authentic performance practice as can be conveyed on a modern piano, with a modern-instrument chamber orchestra of appropriate size.  If that approach to these evergreen works appeals to you, then this set could function as a a fine ""starter collection"" of the Mozart Concertos (minus the four from KV 107 and those numbered 1-4, all of which derive from works of other composers, though they are arranged as concertos by Mozart himself). The set does include the two- and three-piano Concertos, nos. 10 & 7 respectively, though the latter is given in a very effective arrangement for two pianos.  Both are played with zest and imagination by Brendel and Imogen Cooper.Among the highlights of Brendel's cycle, I would cite the following:  6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, and 27. All of these remain free of the didacticism that could sometimes afflict Brendel's playing in the 1970's and 1980's. Few versions of no. 9 convey it's bold inventiveness as effectively as Brendel/Marriner, and I would cite that performance as the high-point of Brendel's cycle for this listener.  Nos. 20 and 24 are appropriately dramatic in a Beethovenian way, though occasionally the brittleness of Brendel's approach--and his tone--prove irksome.  That brittleness is also in evidence in no. 5, which is altogether too aggressive, and intermittently in nos. 15, 21 and 26 as well.  But I am not disposed to overemphasize these liabilities, for Brendel proves throughout this set to be a more than reliable guide to repertoire he obviously knows intimately and loves enthusiastically.  That enthusiasm ultimately wins the day, even in certain works where one might wish for a more gracious, lyrical approach.  For listeners who might find Perahia too delicate, Barenboim too personal, Ashkenazy too robust, and Uchida too introverted (among the complete cycles with which I am familiar), Brendel's collaboration with Marriner and the Academy at the heght of their collective powers might be your best bet.  Moreover, having a first-rate exponent of 18th-Century music at the helm assures that the orchestral contribution has the expert leadership it sometimes lacks in pianist-directed versions of these works.Altogether, a successful venture, strongly recommended, particularly in this price range.  Of course, every classical music lover and pianophile should at least consider obtaining certain Mozart concerto recordings that have deservedly acquired classic status--such as Edwin Fischer in many of the late concertos; Haskil in nos. 9, 13, 29 and 24; Serkin/Szell in 19 & 20; Casadesus/Szell in 21-24, 26-27; Curzon in 20, 23, 24, and 27; Gilels in 27; Kempff in 8, 22, 23, 24 and 27; and Bernstein (as soloist and conductor) in 15.  I would also strongly recommend Brendel's earlier recordings for Vox (particularly 25, 27 and the two-piano Concerto with Klien) and for Vanguard (9 & 14 with Janigro/Zagreb). Haebler's distinctive--if rather ""dresden-china-ish"" cycle with Rowiki for Phillips is regrettably long-gone, as is (I believe) Kraus's less consistently successful cycle with Simon and a pick-up Viennese Orchestra.  If some or all of those two cycles were reissued, that would be a benefaction for collectors.  Kraus's splendid versions of 12 & 18 with Monteux and the BSO is currently available for direct order from Haydn House, in good transfers (don't hesitate if you are an admirer of the pianist).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8MR374KJRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CRJWXA#wasThisHelpful","R2I8MR374KJRN","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suzuki's chronological survey of the complete Bach Cantatas nears its completion with this ""antepenultimate"" volume in the series.  Though Suzuki, the BCJ, and his appointed soloists have gone from strength to strength throughout this venture, their treatment of the ""late"" Cantatas has been extraordinarily satisfying.  Recent volumes have witnessed renewed vigor tempered with a suppleness and lyricism less consistently in evidence elsewhere in the series.  Add to this what seems to be a more forthright placement either by engineers, or by Suzuki, of the vocal ensemble--so that their important polyphonic contribution doesn't get swallowed up by the instrumental lines in full spate--and we have a recipe for success in all three of the works featured on this disc.All of them, too, are mature masterpieces not deserving of their relative neglect.  BWV 97, in particular, is a large-scaled work of remarkable ingenuity and expressiveness.  But BWV 177, with its haunting chorale fantasia on ""Ich ruf' zu dir"" and BWV 9 with its exuberantly joyful opening chorus and deeply expressive penitential aria for tenor are also works of outstanding invention.  Bach, as well as Suzuki, seems indeed to have saved the best for last.The performances, as indicated, are fully equal to the technical demands--as well as the consistently high invention--of these great works.  The instrumental obbligati are played with the utmost conviction and refinement (the demanding solo violin obbligato in BWV 97's tenor aria is a case in point); these musicians really dig in -- no hint of walking on eggshells (as there could be in some of the earliest volumes of this series).  The vocal ensemble likewise seems to relish the sheer pleasure of singing such remarkably complex music--as in the great French Ouverture, whose fugal section turns into a chorale fantasia, with which BWV 97 begins.  Nor is there a hint of routine anywhere in the vast contrapuntal landscapes that unfold before the listener in the opening movements of BWV 177 and BWV 9.  Far from it: the listener is completely drawn in to the theophany -- for theophanies they are.  The four soloists seem to have been given steroids, particularly the long-distance runners Blaze, Türk and Kooij, so tirelessly, even effortlessly, do they meet every challenge that Bach sends their way.  More to the point, they lift the dance-rhythms in the livelier arias, and evoke the pathos in the  meditative ones as if they were engaging in beatific play rather than coping with some of the most difficult vocal music ever written. The soprano, Hana Blazíková, though a fairly recent addition to Suzuki's roster of soloists, shows herself fully the equal of the three veterans in her deep understanding of the Bach idiom, and perhaps even surpasses them in the eager, youthful virtuosity of her singing.The SACD recording is as exemplary as are the performances.  Maximal clarity is married to ambient warmth in near-perfect proportion.As the reader can divine from my overuse of superlatives, this latest volume in Suzuki's Bach Cantata cycle is one to get.  Indeed, it may well be these artists' finest contribution to the series so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBKBUPIJ4G2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRLBHBW#wasThisHelpful","RWBKBUPIJ4G2D","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listeners who have been following Suzuki's Bach Cantata series over the long haul (has it been 15 years or so -- it seems like an eternity) will know what to expect with this latest issue:  lean but not emaciated textures, snappy but not brusque rhythmic articulation, tempos that seem incontestably right, superb playing and singing, and of course sensitivity to Bach's religious vision without a hint of sanctimoniousness.The three works presented here are relatively ""late"" works; as with many of the sacred and secular works from the last 20 years of Bach's life they display an exquisitely subtle craftsmanship and an intellectual rigor that doesn't undermine, but further enlivens their spiritual depths.  BWV 140 is arguably the most popular of all Bach's cantatas, and it receives a first-rate performance here.  The opening chorale setting receives a brisk, confident and joyful account.  Suzuki balances the soprano cantus firmus (reinforced by a brass instrument) perfectly in relation to the dense contrapuntal activity in the lower three parts.  Suzuki preserves a sense of majesty here, amid the urgent call to spiritual awakening.  The two duets between Christ and the soul -- the Bridegroom and the bride -- retain this sense of joyous expectancy.  The erotic undercurrent is brought out (this is baroque opera at its most sublime!), yet without undue sentimentality (as was often the case in older recordings of this work). Blazikova and Kooij surpass all competition among HIP recordings with which I am familiar: theirs is glorious singing by any standard.  The famous tenor chorale, exquisitely sung by Gerd Türk swings ahead with unforced naturalness at just the right tempo.  BWV 112, though not as famous as ""Wachet auf!"" is no less inspired.  It is given a magnificent reading here.  The prominent corno da caccia parts in the opening chorale setting are given their head, with stunning results--despite one or two rough moments.  Robin Blaze is splendid in the alto aria, and in the bass arioso is appropriately spooky -- and expressively sung by Kooij. However, the high point of this peformance was, for me, the soprano-tenor duet, in which the two soloists manage to accommodate Bach's excruciatingly high tessitura, and rapid roulades, without so much as a hint of strain. I have always found this movement hard to listen to in most other recordings; the mood should be exuberantly joyful, but so often it is simply tense, due either to the evident discomfort of the singers, or to an overly brusque approach (or both).  Overall, this is the most satisfying version of BWV 112 I have heard; at least a version that is virtually flawless and that realizes the work's inherent nobility as well as its dramatic contrasts.  BWV 29 is well-known due its scintillating sinfonia, for which Bach transforms the opening movement of the E-major violin Partita into a concertante juggernaut for organ and festive ensemble (bedecked with trumpets).  This receives a thrilling account here; the ornate organ part going like the wind.  The opening chorus was later adapted for the ""Gratias agimus""/""Dona nobis pacem"" movements in the b-minor Mass.  It is given a splendid rendition by Suzuki's forces. I was delighted to note that Suzuki is not shy about building the piece inexorably to its climax, with the entrance of the trumpets and timpani.  Thereafter the elaborate arias and ariosi are sung with that combination passionate involvement and virtuosity that has been a hallmark of this installment in Suzuki's Cantata series.The SACD recording seems more immediate in its impact than some previous issues.  Moreover, the engineers have managed to give needed clarity and focus to the choral textures, thereby forestalling my longstanding complaint about the series (indeed, my one and only complaint)--namely, that the the vocal ensemble could sometimes sound emaciated in relation to the surrounding orchestral textures, with the result that important contrapuntal detail gets submerged.Given the quality of the music -- three of Bach's greatest works in the genre -- and of the performances, which deserve a ""straight A"" as we professorial types would say, this volume is one not to miss in Suzuki's near-complete traversal of the Cantatas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DER6BEWZVFAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGMT96S#wasThisHelpful","R1DER6BEWZVFAX","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have only recently discovered the artistry of Simone Dinnerstein via her recent all-Bach album for Sony (the one with two keyboard concerti, an English Suite, and assorted transcriptions of organ chorale preludes). Her stunning playing on that CD prompted purchase of the recital under review here.  The unlikely pairing of Bach and Schubert amply displays her signal pianistic virtues: exquisite phrasing, astonishing control of tone, touch and texture, and an artistic sensibility that seems like a throwback to the very greatest pianists of yesteryear. One critic justly compared her to Dame Myra Hess, though I am reminded even more of Maria Tipo--another controversial artist--in the Bach partitas. The Schubert finds a depth of expression reminiscent of Radu Lupu, and no praise could be higher.  Her Bach is on a similarly exalted plane, though not every listener will approve of her pronounced rubato and agogic hesitations. These traits of her pianistic persona do not bother me, however; I grew up with the very personalized Bach of Glenn Gould.  I find that the Leipzig Cantor's creations not only survive, but positively thrive, when the recreative artist takes interpretive risks.This is indeed astonishingly beautiful playing.  I cannot recommend this recital highly enough, despite its baffling title and somewhat glitzy presentation (which make Dinnerstein seem like the latest crossover phenomenon).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15HX5OOOJCL12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JDD80Q#wasThisHelpful","R15HX5OOOJCL12","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barenboim was at his best when he recorded for EMI early in his career.  His renditions of the Mozart and Beethoven Piano Concertos, as well as his chamber-music collaborations with du Pré and Zukerman, from that time (1965-1970) have always struck me as among the finest ever accounts of standard pianistic repertoire.  So, too, are his renditions of Beethoven's 32 Sonatas--the so-called ""New Testament"" of piano literature (the OT being Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier).  This is feisty, youthful Beethoven, and none the worse for that.  I appreciate this approach even in the more exalted, late works, which receive appropriately thoughtful, if somewhat romanticized accounts here, with plenty of *Sturm und Drang* to leaven the mysticism.  At times in the later works I was reminded of past masters such as Egon Petri or Myra Hess (to implicate two very unlikely suspects).  In the early and middle-period works, Barenboim's spontaneous combustion keeps the music from ever sounding routine; no phrase is taken for granted, and each is lovingly and creatively sculpted.  Throughout, Barenboim's rich tone and sparkling treble register  (beautifully captured by EMI's engineers) make this one of the most ear-pleasing, indeed sensuously beautiful Beethoven cycles of the stereo era.  The occasional smudged passagework or uneven trill reminds the listener not of any technical liabilities on Barenboim's part, but of the long takes -- perhaps even entire movements -- that afford a simulacrum of live performance throughout the cycle. Some listeners may resist some of Barenboim's controversial interpretive choices.some of which may well have been decided on the spur of the moment, such as the application of discernible rubato and other tempo modifications within a movement, or occasional extremes of tempo (at both ends of the spectrum).  Despite these minor caveats, however, this could conceivably be a first choice for neophyte collectors on the lookout for an inexpensive Beethoven cycle. One could  then go on to obtain more historically significant cycles by the likes of Schnabel, Kempff, Backhaus or Brendel (Vox is best) for comparison and contrast.  My only criticism of this latest reissue of Barenboim's first (and better) Beethoven cycle is that the booklet has omitted the superb and detailed annotations of the previous edition in favor of skimpy and generalized comments.  No matter; this one is a winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13164E0HDYCOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DK3QBY#wasThisHelpful","R13164E0HDYCOQ","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ormandy's *Heldenleben* as been my preferred version for years. I find it more rewarding than more famous versions by Karajan, Reiner and Beecham.  Ormandy's account features rich, sumptuous orchestral playing, as we would expect, but also a very intelligent structuring of the whole, so that the work doesn't sound episodic (as it can in concert or on record).  Finer still are Szell's fizzing accounts of *Don Juan* and *Till Eulenspiegel*:  the playing of the Clevelanders, though less voluptuous than Ormandy's Philadelphians, is amazingly crisp, clear, and full of character.  The wind playing (including the all-important French Horns) is astonishingly virtuosic.  Szell's direction has the listener hanging on every note as these two musical narratives unfold.  All three recordings sound fine to my ears: fuller in Philadelphia; cleaner in Cleveland.This CD provides something like an ideal introduction to Richard Strauss for the neophyte.  For more extensive surveys of his tone poems, I can strongly recommend 2-CD sets by Haitink (on Phillips Duo) and Solti (Decca/London).  Then of course there are the larger surveys by Kempe (Warner/EMI and Brilliant), Reiner (Sony/RCA) and Karajan (DG)-- each one a classic, and all available now in affordable ""bargain boxes.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6K8JKDWK3CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000027XZ#wasThisHelpful","R2G6K8JKDWK3CU","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can only echo the views of my fellow reviewers (three to date):  Constantin Silvestri is indeed one of the top ten (I would say top half-dozen) most underappreciated conductors.  I, too, purchased the ten-CD set from Disky at an exorbitant price a few years ago.  I do not, however, regret that decision, for that set has given me enormous enjoyment.  Now the prospect of having the remainder of Silverstri's EMI recordings in my collection (minus his collaborations with Francois and Menuhin) is more than worth the nominal cost of the entire 15-CD collection.SIlverstri's Dvorák and Tchaikovsky are justly famous for their combination of visceral excitement with intelligent musicianship. But Silvestri's repertoire was huge; he does equally well with composers as diverse as Elgar, Shostakovitch, Rimsky-Korsakoff, and Ravel.  Much though I admire Silvestri's fellow-countryman, Celibidache (particularly in Bruckner), I have to say that the former is by far the more consistently satisfying conductor.  His interpretations never wear out their welcome with repeated hearing, as can those of Celibidache.  Among great conductors of which I am aware, Silvestri's interpretive priorities most resemble those of Cantelli in favoring swift (but not breathless) tempos, beautifully sustained cantabile phrasing, incisive rhythmic articulation without abruptness, carefully ""etched"" coloristic detail, and perfectly balanced orchestral textures. Why, then, is his artistry not better known?  Why has EMI waited so long to revive his recorded legacy?However one is inclined to answer these questions, we must be grateful for this massive retrospective edition of a conductor who deserves another chance at the limelight.P.S.:  And while you're at it, obtain the Carl Schuricht box from EMI/Icon.

"I have been purchasing Naxos discs for nigh on twenty years.  Frequently, they hold outstanding performances of standard and more esoteric repertoire; but just as frequently the performances are not quite competitive with the best the ""major labels"" have to offer (though the very concept of a ""major label"" could be called into question these days). In any case, this humble entry in the Naxos catalog is a jewel in the that label's crown.  These concertos for standard oboe and oboe d'amore are actually reconstructions of works that we usually hear in Bach's own adaptations for single or double harpsichord.  Bach's originals have been lost, though musicological research has determined that they were probably concertos for oboe.  In the case of BWV 1059--a stunning work in d-minor--the outer movements derive from the two sinfonias from Cantata BWV 35. The slow movement could have been some version of a cantata aria featuring obbligato oboe (the alto aria from BWV 42 has sometimes been motted as a possibility, as has the first aria from BWV 35).  In this recording Hommel and Müller-Bruhl give us a transcription of the slow movement from Alessandro Marcello's famous oboe concerto (the entirety of which Bach himself transcribed for keyboard, so its inclusion here is not as much of a speculative stretch as it might seem).The main reason to purchase this disc, however, is not only to hear skilful reconstructions of speculative original versions, but to enjoy Christian Hommel's exquisite playing and the ensemble's lively and gracious contribution under Müller-Bruhl's skilful direction.  Hommel clearly has the measure of the late-baroque idiom, though he and the members of the Cologne Chamber Orchestra are apparently playing modern instruments in historically-informed style (the pitch sounds like A-440 to my ears).  Hommel phrases with utter sensitivity not only in the expressive slow movements (where we would expect him to) but also in the outer movements, which are taken at quite a clip here. His virtuosity in negotiating the elaborate figuration, ornamentation and ""editorial"" cadenzas is quite formidable.  Müller-Bruhl, whose work in Bach I had not previously heard, is also on his mettle here -- as are his players.  He direction is incisive and highly charged, bringing out the dance-rhythms infectiously.  The harpsichord continuo player also deserves accolades for his or her imaginative and brilliantly executed realizations.

"So many accolades have been given this recording already -- including the Gramophone ""Record of the Year"" Award from 2012 -- that yet another review would seem superfluous.  I will therefore add only a few brief comments:I begin by affirming that this is probably the finest Schütz recording to date (though Frieder Bernius's DHM recording of Symphoniae Sacrae III runs it a close second, in my estimation).  The singing is indeed ""luminous"" and beautifully blended, and the ensemble's understanding and projection of the words (all-important in this composer) is impeccable.  Rhythms are lively but never punched out.  Tempos are perfectly set to underscore the affect of the text; nothing is breezed over, and nothing is trudged through.  The four funeral motets that accompany the *Musicalische Exequien* are exquisite and rarely heard works; Meunier's renditions of these are equally exquisite.The recorded sound is eminently natural, with a pleasing reverberant ""halo"" around the voices, yet without blurring.  My only criticism would be that the solo voices in the concluding motet of the *Musicalische Exequien* (""Selig sind die Toten) are placed rather too distantly from the microphones for their contribution to make its make  intended effect.  They sound ethereal and seraphic--as they should--but the dynamic contrast between them and the ripieno ensemble is too steep.That minor quibble aside, this recording is one every Schütz devotee should own.  It clearly outstrips any previous recording of the Requiem (Gardiner's estimable version now sounds fussy and overemphatic by comparison).Laus Deo!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278LIPBTQQEYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S7ZZ5Q#wasThisHelpful","R278LIPBTQQEYO","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just discovered the Richter *Messiah*, and it has been quite a revelation.  I have collected recorded versions of this work--always a favorite, and not just during high holy days--for nearly half a century. I am also quite familiar with Richter's numerous Bach recordings, as well as his superb rendition of Handel's *Samson.*  But for some reason I have never gotten around, until now, to auditioning his Messiah.  Perhaps I was deterred by the fact that Richter recorded this work not with his usual ensembles--the Munich Bach Orchestra and Choir--but with English forces (LPO/John Alldis Choir).  Or more likely, I felt an certain reluctance to purchase yet another version of a work that I know so well, and in so many editions, reconstructions, and performance practices.  In any case, I am delighted at having discovered what is, in my estimation, one of the most effective renditions of the work ever commited to disc.  No, that is not the mot juste:  ""effective"" is just too neutral an adjective.  Better to say stunning, sublime, elevating, indeed -- glorious!  I don't know what to praise most: Ricther's intensely dramatic, perfectly proportioned, lofty conception of the work; the John Alldis Choir's beautifully focused, nimbly exectued, and clearly articulated choral singing; the sumptuous but still idiomatic orchestral playing; the deeply expressive singing of the four soloists; or the brilliant continuo realizations by Hedwig Bilgram (imported from Munich along with Herr Richter).  Well, I shall praise all of these elements, since all contribute to something like a total realization of the work (mostly the Prout sequence, with one minor variant in the form of the tenor arioso version of ""their sound has gone out"").I will confine my detailed remarks to Richter's conception of the work and the solo singing.  As might have been anticipated from his recordings of the great choral works of Bach, Richter fully appreciates the spiritual dimensions of Handel's masterpiece.  *Messiah* is, for Richter, not just a musico-dramatic entertainment; nor is it simply a cultural icon, much less a museum piece to be contemplated in a state of historicist abstraction. Rather, it is nothing short of living communion, in sound, with the central mysteries of the Christian Faith. Of course, Richter is (mostly) aware of correct performance practice when it comes to tempo articulation and ornamentation, though he sees no reason to stint on the extra body of color provided by modern instruments and full-fledged solo and choral singers. He is also cognizant of the genuinely operatic qualities Handel brings even to a work which (along with *Israel In Egypt*) is among the least ""operatic"" of his oratorios.  And indeed he respects the work's iconic status as a mainstay of British culture and of that country's ""choral festival"" tradition (manifest in the grandeur of scale Richter maintains throughout, though minus the excessive stateliness of overinflated Victorian/Edwardian performances).  Finally, a word about the soloists.  Veteran collectors of *Messiah* recordings, myself included, will have distinct preferences on this score, and they may not coincide with any of the singers Richter (or DG) has enlisted for this recording.  To my ears, only Donald MacIntyre--who is genuinely awe-inspiring in most of his arias--could be thought to equal or surpass the best of the competition. Otherwise, I would give the nod to Alexander Young over Stuart Burrows, Janet Baker or Helen Watts over Anna Reynolds (haunting though her distinctive timbre is in ""He was despised""), Pierette Alarie or Jennifer Vyvvian over Helen Donath (not ideally pure of voice).  But this is a impossibly competitive field--and Ricther's solo team is, overall, ""as good as any and better than most.""The remastered recording is rich, detailed, spacious and capable of considerable visceral impact in the grander numbers (the concluding ""Amen"" will lift you right out of your seat).In sum, this is a *Messiah* to cherish along with whatever other recordings you happen to favor; for me that will always be, among modern performance practice versions, Scherchen (mono and stereo), Beecham (mono and stereo), Sargent (1961 ""Reader's Digest"" recording), and Andrew Davis.  Each of these has its distinctive virtues and deficiencies, and Richter--the addition to my list of favorites--is no exception.  Whether over the long haul of numerous re-hearings it emerges as the one I would take, above all others, to the proverbial desert island, I cannot say.  But I predict that I will be returning to it regularly for spiritual edification as well as musical enrichment.  Don't miss it if you happen to resonate with my enthusiasms as articulated in this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AGGHN6Y0YSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GY3#wasThisHelpful","R9AGGHN6Y0YSH","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cantatas featured on the latest installment of Suzuki/BCJ's ongoing Bach Cantata series are among the most obscure in the Leipzig Cantor's output.  Nevertheless, all are delightful, edifying works.  I am particularly fond of BWV 195 (a wedding cantata) with its spectacular opening chorus -- rich with fugal textures and adorned with the most enlivening orchestral fireworks imaginable.  Those nuptials must have been quite an occasion!  BWV 192 is also a very engaging work; light, even galant in mood (as are the central movements of BWV 195), it provides an unexpectedly delicate setting for a hearty, and very well-known, Lutheran hymn (in English, ""Now thank we all our God"").  BWV 157 is also a light-textured work, in chamber style.  It's winsome charm is somewhat at odds with its funereal purpose, but who's complaining?  Finally, BWV 120a, which may be getting its first-ever airing here, is a reconstructed variant of the more familiar Town Council Election Cantata, BWV 120.  The Wedding version includes three recitatives, with choral interjections, that are not found in BWV 120.  The arias, too, are quite different in scoring and texture from their counterparts in the Election cantata.All of these rarely-heard works receive superb performances from these well-seasoned players and singers.  The vocal soloists include a tenor and countertenor who are, I believe, new to the series, and who, at least for the present recording, replace the ""regulars"" Gerd Türk and Robin Blaze.  All four cope well with the often hefty demands of their arias, though I don't quite care for the tenor soloist's nasal timbre (which acquires a whiny edge at the upper extremity of his range).  Bass Peter Kooij, as usual, delivers the goods--especially in the enchantingly whimsical central aria of BWV 195. As is Suzuki's regular practice, the soloists also sing in the larger vocal ensemble (three to a part); their nimble and finely nuanced singing is commendable, even if the balance of forces frequently favors the instruments over the voices (my one longstanding complaint against the Suzuki Cantata project).  This balance may be intentional on the part of the conductor; or it may be a function of the reverberant acoustic of the Kobe Shoin Chapel plus the engineering; but it sometimes obscures important fugal entrances and textural detail in the ""choral"" movements.But why quibble?  The music is glorious--and at times, in these works, quite unexpectedly forward-looking (the bass aria in BWV 195 almost sounds as if it could have been composed by one of Bach's sons; was this a gesture of acceptance of the ethos of a younger generation, presumably that of the nuptial pair, on the part of an aging composer?).  The performances convey a kind of joyful abandon and flexibility that we haven't always heard from this ensemble and conductor.  One of the best of a generally outstanding series, in my estimation.  Collectors of the series or neophytes need not hesitate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ONRLBH7BQYMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097RFEUI#wasThisHelpful","R1ONRLBH7BQYMW","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicolai Lugansky was just a name in the music periodicals prior to my auditioning this set.  Now he has joined the ranks of great pianists in my estimation.  His teacher Tatiana Nicolayeva predicted that he would be successor to Richter and Gilels, and her estimation is by no means hyperbole.  This extrordinarily gifted pianist combines Richter's probing intellect and tensile strength with Gilels's sensitivity and exquisite touch.  He also brings to these recordings an distinctive exploratory quality, an inventiveness that takes nothing for granted.Among the highlights in this set, which surveys a decade's worth of recordings for the Erato/Warner label, is a coruscating traversal of the Chopin Etudes that exhibits jaw-dropping technical facility and sensitivity to nuance in equal measure.  This joins the select company of Pollini and Perahia at the top of the heap (and a huge heap it is -- a great many virtuosi have scaled this technical Everest on records).  Another highlight is a complete traversal of the Rachmaninov Piano Concertos with the Birmingham orchestra under the direction of Sakari Oramo.  His renditions of nos. 1 and 4 are among the very few I have heard that make an entirely convincing case for these works which have tended to hide in the shadow of the ever-popular c-minor and d-minor works.  Clarity and poise coupled with scintillating passagework and, throughout, a seriousness of purpose, make Lugansky's accounts of all four concertos uniquely memorable. The same can be said for the Paganini Rhapsody. I haven't been as swept away by these works since I first encountered the old Wild-Horenstein set three decades ago.  Oramo and his fine orchestra offer alert and incisive support.  We are also given a generous helping of solo works by Rachmaninov -- Preludes, Etudes-Tableaux, and two sets of Variations (Corelli and Chopin).  I was particularly impressed by the variation.  These works can seem diffuse in structure and uneven in inspiration; but under Lugansky's fluent and intelligent fingers, they sparkle and entice as I am sure the composer intended.There is more Chopin solo repertoire to enjoy as well; all of it technically astonishing and always thoughtful, if at times overly serious; one wishes he would lighten the mood where appropriate.  The same could be said for the Beethoven sonatas which greet the prospective listener enticingly on the first disc. Lugansky bears down on these works for all of the intensity they are worth; and while there is nothing trite or trivial about these performances, the doesn't quite convey Beethoven's variegation of moods and textures.  There is more unbuttoned humor in no. 22, elegence in no. 7 and tenderness in no. 23 than he allows us to hear. But then I was brought up on Kempff's Beethoven, and that may account for why I found Lugansky's interpretations a bit relentless.  They are, nevertheless, eminently musical and technically astonishing, as is everything else in this set.Two chamber works are included in this set:  the Chopin and Rachmaninov Cello Sonatas with Valdimir Knushev.  Cellist and pianist think and play as one here: this is a genuine partnership, in which both artists exploit every opportunity for conversational interaction.  Rarely have I heard these works performed so convincingly; they are masterpieces of their kind, yet in numerous recordings their full stature is eclipsed either by the performers' egos or by their failure to appreciate the subtle invention in each work.  Needless to say, both artists play at full stretch technically, and these are very demanding works for both cellist and pianist.Despite one or two reservations noted above, I cannot recommend this inexpensive and vividly recorded set strongly enough.  If you haven't heard Lugansky, or want to add some or all of this repertoire to your collection, don't hesitate to purchase thsi compilation while it is available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YATBODLO4LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006W7SUK2#wasThisHelpful","R29YATBODLO4LE","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carl Schuricht was clearly one of the great masters of the podium, though his legacy remains underappreciated -- in part because he recorded less frequently than many of his contemporaries (e.g., Toscanini, Furtwängler, Böhm, Klemperer, Walter), and in part because his conductorial persona was more introverted than theirs.  Schuricht never courted or cultivated cult status; his podium manners were as gentlemanly and undemonstrative as his interpretations are direct and unfussy.  In general he favored brisk tempos, clearly articulated rhythmic patterns, finely shaped but never overinflected phrasing, and judicious orchestral balances (even in the biggest Brucknerian climaxes the brass are never allowed to blare).Speaking of Bruckner, Schuricht is generally acknowledged as one of the finest interpreters of that composer, and these EMI recordings of the third, eighth and ninth symphonies with the VPO (then as now one of the very greatest Bruckner orchestras) amply supports that assessment. Schuricht's commercial recording of the third has not been readily available since the LP era (though there was a CD reissue on a minor label a number of years ago).  It is a splendid interpretation: the opening conveys just the right atmosphere of mystery, of exalted expectation, and as the first movement proceeds, each climax is perfectly placed and graded.  The architecture emerges more clearly than in most other versions I have heard.  The raptures of the slow movement, on the other hand, are not overplayed; there is a discretion and a naturalness to Schuricht's exposition that completely avoids schmaltz (sometimes a risk when Brucknerian lyricism is overplayed); the relatively flowing tempo helps him in this regard. The scherzo is incisive, dramatic, but also playful as it should be.  Since this is the 1889-90 text, the finale is severely truncated; but Schuricht manages to make the movement seem unified, expansive and a satisfying culmination to the work, avoiding any abruptness.  And that great polka-chorale episode has never been so perfectly articulated or balanced (in my listening experience, anyway).  The Eighth and Ninth share similar virtues.  These are better-known recordings, having been reissued at least once before by EMI, and critics have usually responded favorably to them.  Some listeners may find Schuricht's Ninth somewhat wanting in fervor; the great dissonant climaxes (such as the one occurring just before the coda of the third movement) are not as shattering as they can be with other conductors (Schuricht will seem downright tame when compared with Furtwängler or even Jochum).  But this relative gentleness fits well within Schuricht's general conception of the work, which is more lyrical and open-hearted, even optimistic, than one usually hears.  There can be no such reservations about Schuricht's Eighth, however.  In this work the conductor gives a perfectly balanced exposition of the Nowak edition -- neither the agony nor the ecstasy allowed to dominate.  To be sure the first movement broods effectively, the scherzo sweeps along rambustiously, the adagio carries the listener forward on a tide -- but not a tsunami -- of exaltation, and the finale is a cogent symphonic argument, not just a relentless juggernaut.Altogether, a feast for Brucknerians, especially for those who are eager to hear a kinder, gentler approach to their favored composer.As if this were not sufficient, we are also given a remarkable Beethoven cycle with a vintage French orchestra, captured while its distinctive, francophone timbres were still in full cry.  Schuricht's approach to Beethoven is mobile, light-textured, sometimes hard-hitting, and rhythmically snappy at fairly brisk tempos.  One is reminded most of Leibowitz and Ansermet in this composer, and not at all of Schuricht's German compatriots.  If you resist ponderous Beethoven, but find Toscanini too harried and hectic, then Schuricht's cycle is for you.  Yes, those francophone horns do sound disconcertingly like saxophones, and the trio of the Eroica's third movement adds unintentional hilarity to its athleticism as a result.  But how often does one get to hear such characterful wind playing these days?  As with any Beethoven cycle, there are strengths and weaknesses:  the Ninth doesn't storm the heavens as much as I would like, and other conductors have given us more radiant accounts of no. 4 and the *Pastoral*.  However, I regard Schuricht's *Eroica* as one of the very greatest on record (despite those vibrato-laden horns); nos. 2, 5 and 8 are not far behind: strong, trenchant, yet beautifully nuanced performances that will recall Weingartner to some listeners.A Beethoven cycle to cherish, then.As indicated, EMI has handled the remasterings particularly well; I don't recall that previous incarnations of the Bruckner 8 and 9 or the Beethoven cycle sounded quite this good.  The packaging is what one has come to expect for EMI's Icon series -- a nice, sturdy slimline box, with a booklet, detailed track listings, and annotations that include a judicious appreciation of Schuricht's artistry.If you haven't yet discovered that distinctive artistry, then here is a golden opportunity at a very affordable price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SDK6G9R8D7J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I15774#wasThisHelpful","R3SDK6G9R8D7J4","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you haven't yet discovered the genius of Wilhelm Stenhammar, Naxos has provided a golden opportunity to explore two of his finest orchestral works at minimal expense. The Second Symphony is an astonishing work--epic in scale, brilliantly scored, graced with beguiling melodic invention, haunting modal harmonies poignant dissonances, and seemingly effortless contrapuntal mastery.  One is reminded of Bruckner at his most expansive, Brahms at his most ardent, Mendelssohn at his most elfin, Elgar at his noblest, Sibelius at his most bardic.  Yet by the time he wrote the G=minor Symphony,Stenhammar was unquestionably his own man -- closest perhaps to Nielsen in spirit (he had introduced the latter's g-minor Symphony to Göteborg audiences in 1910), but otherwise utterly distinctive. The Symphony's great fugal finale rivals that of Bruckner's Fifth in scope and ingenuity (Brucknerians, I kid you not!)--though Stenhammar's polyphony is more playful than monumental.  The *Excelsior!* Overture is an earlier work, and stylistically more derivative (I hear a lot of Schumann and Brahms, though the shape of the themes and the occasionally capricious turns of phrase bespeak the mature Stenhammar).Both works are given very fine performances by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under Petter Sundkvist.  My first exposure to the Second Symphony was through Järvi's earlier BIS recording taken down at a live concert,followed by his DG studio recording from the early 1990's, also with the Göteborg Symphony Orchestra.  Both of those are terrifically exciting versions, with my nod going to the rougher-hewn, but more spontaneous live performance.  Sundkvist's reading sounds a bit sober in comparison, but it is also perhaps a more deeply considered interpretation.  Sundkvist brings out the majesty of the writing in the first and last movements better than Järvi, and in the latter he also draws the polyphonic threads together more effectively.  I marginally prefer Järvi's lighter touch in the Scherzo, but in the hauntingly beautiful Andante, Sundkvist once again surpasses Järvi in conveying the ""nordic summer evening"" atmosphere.  Yet despite these considerations, my loyalties overall remain with Järvi, who, though he may purchase visceral excitement at the expense of nobility, nevertheless proves more involving overall. But that is not to diminish Sundkvist's steadier version, either--each earns a distinguished place (along with Järvi's DG account and Stig Westerberg on Capricorn) in the Stenhammar discography.  Sundkvist's *Excelsior!* is everything it should be--passionately engaging, refulgent in lyricism.  In both works, Sundkvist elicits fine playing from every section the RSNO.  Though the strings, as recorded here, don't sound as full of tone or incisive of attack as Järvi's Gothenbergers, the Scottish brass provide beautifully robust and rounded tone--essential in both works--and the wind playing has suitably colorful.The Naxos recording provides nicely balanced textures and plenty of impact -- when played at a higher than normal volume setting. Otherwise, the rather distant placement of the microphones (more of an issue in the Symphony than in the Overture) makes the orchestral sonorities sound a bit washed-out.In the end, however, such reservations are of minor importance; for this is probably the best single-disc introduction to Stenhammar's symphonic music available; you will by no means regret owning it.  If you are sufficiently impressed by the two works on this CD, I strongly recommend adding at least two further CDs to your Stenhammar collection:  Andrew Davis's definitive account of the great Serenade op.31 (most recently reissued with delightful Grieg and Nielsen couplings on a very inexpensive Warner Apex CD) and a recent Chandos recording of the two piano concertos.  Then, if you are sufficiently intrigued by the prospect of Stenhammar chamber music, you might want to purchase a 2-CD set from CPO of String Quartets 3-6, stunningly played by the Oslo Quartet. Brilliant Classics has also reissued the bulk of Paavo and Neeme Järvi's BIS recordings of Stenhammar orchestral music (with a couple of vocal works thrown in, though minus the Serenade)in a reasonably priced 3-CD compendium.Whatever course you decide to take, do get to know the magnificent music of Wilhelm Stenhammar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J195INQMKGYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000014FN#wasThisHelpful","R3J195INQMKGYL","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wilhelm Stenhammar was arguably Sweden's greatest composer -- not excluding Alfven, Wiren and Berwald.  His music is skilfully crafted (prodigious gifts for counterpoint and orchestration), melodically distinctive (his themes are as sui generis as those of Grieg, Sibelius and Nielsen), and formally inventive. His early works betrayed the influences of Brahms, Dvorak, and Bruckner (among others), but as he matured he found his voice -- and what a distinctive voice it is!  Unfortunately, the canon of his mature works is relatively small, due to the strenuous demands on Stenhammar's time as a much-in-demand concert pianist and conservatory administrator.  But what we do have from him is almost uniformly magnificent.  I would not hesitate to compare his achievement, as a symphonist and composer of string quartets, with that of his better-known Scandinavian counterparts.  One you have heard his Second Symphony you will be convinced that here is a major voice in Late Romantic music.Brilliant Classics' inexpensive survey of his orchestral works(unfortunately, minus his great Serenade, Op.31) provides a golden opportunity to acquaint yourself with this remarkable composer.  Except for the aforementioned Serenade and a couple of overtures, all of his important symphonic and concertante works are here, plus a generous helping of shorter vocal works and some incidental music.  All are worth your attention, though I predict you will return most often to the Second Symphony (worthy of Bruckner and Sibelius) and the two Piano Concertos (the first a youthfully exuberant spin-off of the Brahms B-flat major concerto and the Second a concentrated and ingeniously crafted work foreshadowing Medtner).  All of these recordings derive from the BIS label.  The two Symphonies were taken down at live performances under Neeme Järvi; both are terrifically exciting under his direction and played with utter convictio by the fine Gothenburg orchestra.  For the remainder Neeme shares the honors with Paavo, his son, who does well by the shorter works played to the hilt by the Malmö symphony.  The two violin romances are fetchingly done and the two pianists (Derwinger in Concerto 2 and Ortiz in Concerto 1) dispatch their demanding parts with considerable elan and technical fluency.  The sound--enhanced by the lively and warm acoustics of the Göteborg  hall--is exceptionally fine throughout this set: clear and detailed with plenty of ambient warmth.There is a surprising amount of competition in the current catalog for most of these compositions.  Neeme Järvi went on to record a survey of the chief orchestral works for DG (the two Symphonies, plus the Serenade and an Overture not included in Brilliant's anthology, also with the Gothenberg Philharmonic}; those performances are more polished, and perhaps more deeply considered than the spontaneously-combusting live versions reviewed above.  Some critics have opined that Järvi's characteristic penchant for brisk, no-nonsense readings undermines the lyrical splendors of Stenhammar's music, though Jarvi's relatively hard-driving approach to the two Symphonies may well be an advantage for first-time listeners, insofar as it maximizes the dramatic urgency of the music and minimizes any impression of prolixity (the very fecundidty of Stenhammar's imagination can create that impression on first hearing). Many critics prefer Stieg Westerberg's EMI recordings of the Symphonies for their greater breadth and lyrical ardor, and for this reason some listeners may prefer that recording (still available, I believe). The two piano concertos have recently been revisited by Seta Tanyel in a well-received recording on Chandos (conducted by Andrew Manze).  On the other hand, the Brilliant box has the sdvantage of containing a number of shorter pieces, in fine performances, that are hard to find in alternative versions.In sum, then, this Brilliant collection is probably the best alternative at present for listeners seeking an introduction to this composer.  If you end up catching the ""Stenhammar bug""--which is quite likely given the quality of his music--you can go on to explore alternative versions of the major works.  You may also find yourself encouraged to explore Stenhammar's equally remarmable cycle of String Quartets (excellent versions of these works are available).  In any case, don't miss out on acquainting yourself with the music of this unjustly neglected composer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFM0CD6K5AH6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W5MNR2#wasThisHelpful","RFM0CD6K5AH6Y","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sony's budget-priced reissue campaign proceeds apace.  A few months ago, they exhumed the Juilliard String Quartet's estimable traversals of Mozart's ""Haydn"" Quartets and String Quintets from the CBS vaults; now from the old RCA catalog comes an equally distinguished traversal of the same repertoire by the Guarneri Quartet.  Since both sets are quite inexpensive, chamber music enthusiasts might want to purchase both, for the approaches of these two distinguished American ensembles provide sharp and fascinating contrasts.  Whereas the Juilliard favor a lean collective tone, incisive attacks and strong rhythmic articulation, the Guarneri's favor a sweetly lyrical approach, more leisurely tempos, and an elegant, even suave manner.  They also strive to maintain the ""long line"" at all costs, thereby bringing out the ""vocal"" and operatic qualities in Mozart's chamber music.  Both approaches are valid--the Juilliards leaning more toward a Classical style, and the Guarneri's toward a proto-romantic interpretation that harks back to mid-Twentieth Century Viennese ensembles such as the Konzerthaus Quartet, the Baryllis and the Wellers.The results, in the case of the Guarneri's readings (no less than the Juilliard's) are simply splendid.  Mozart opined that operatic ensembles should ""flow like oil,"" and that metaphor aptly describes the Guarneri's traversals of all twelve of these wonderful works.  The Six ""Haydn"" Quartets come from the early 1970's and find the ensemble in splendid form; slow movements, in particular, are deeply considered and ensemble throughout is near-perfect.  The engineers provide a warm ambience without sacrificing clarity; at all times the four instruments are clearly audible. The Quintets derive from the late 1980's, and were taken down at live concerts.  Three distinguished violists participate in two Quintets apiece. The interpretations are, in a word, magnificent.  These musicians clearly appreciate the intricacy of Mozart's craftsmanship no less than his profound, and profoundly unsettling, expression of the human condition with all its ambiguities and paradoxes.  The Guarneri and their distinguished guest violists also cultivate a fully conversational style, in which each performer responds to the others in dialogic fashion.  In other words, these are genuine chamber music performances, not occasions for five virtuosos to exhibit their talents (though there is no want of virtuosity when required; apart from one or two momentary intonational lapses, the playing is immaculate throughout).  The three greatest Quintets (the C-Major, G-Minor and D-major) are given performances that approach sublimity, and once again the slow movements are presented as the heart of each work.  The engineering is as fine here as with the studio recordings of the Haydn Quartets.  There is plenty of hall ambience, though not so much as to muddy the textures, and there are no distracting audience noises.In sum then, this distinguished set of Mozart chamber music that deserves to rank alongside the finest versions of the Haydn Quartets and Viola Quintets --including the Juilliard versions mentioned above, as well as those by the Amadeus, the Budapest, and the Pro Arte (the latter are classic performances from the 78-rpm era last seen in an early-1990's set from EMI).  As usual with this new series from Sony, there is minimal documentation.  But the music is the thing, and on that score listeners will not be disappointed.  Warmly recommended, then, both to veteran collectors and to those looking for a ""basic library selection.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7UQM3M3RR3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006XOBFWE#wasThisHelpful","R3A7UQM3M3RR3V","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warner's Handel Edition is an economical way of acquiring a substantial portion of Handel's orchestral and vocal output -- if one os prepared to do without much documentation (such as texts and, in the case of works in Latin or Italian, translations).  Both of the oratorios included in this volume are in English, though the choral diction and that of some soloists is not always sufficiently idiomatic or clear so that one can do without a libretto.That regret having been voiced, I heartily recommend this particular volume of the Handel Edition.  Both oratorios are splendid -- among Handel's supreme masterworks in the genre.  Belshazzar is a vividly dramatic piece on an epic scale; Jephtha is a more intimate, personal tragedy, filled with Handel's profoundest meditations on the human condition.  It was also the composer's final work in the genre (discounting the largely recycled ""Triumph of Time and Truth""); his struggle with his oncoming blindness, and the fragility of his mortal frame, is manifest throughout his musical setting of the troubling story from the Hebrew Scriptures.There have been several fine recordings of *Jephtha* over the years--including Somary, Marriner, Gardiner and Creed (the ones I have heard), but fewer of *Belshazzar* (I wonder why the latter has never quite caught on with audiences or even with ardent Handelians).  Harnoncourt's version of the latter is, by a fair margin, the best of the available versions.  Pinnock's has some fine soloists and boasts a superb English choir that declaims the text far more idiomatically and clearly than Harnoncourt's Viennese group.  However, I find Pinnock's *Belshazzar* to be weighed down by a fatal dullness.  Neumann, on the other hand (on MDG), leads his forces with plenty of dramatic flair; unfortunately, his soloists by and large do not sound comfortable with their roles--or with singing in English--and his two countertenors are inexcusably shrill. Harnoncourt has by far the best cast of the three recordings (Tear, Palmer and Lehane are outstanding), as well as a choral ensemble able to sing with rhythmic incisiveness and supple phrasing (despite mushy diction on occasion).  The Concentus Musicus plays with their customary fervor, if not always with as much refinement as we would expect from period-instrument ensembles today (*Belshazzar* was recorded in 1975). Haroncourt manages to convey a cumulative dramatic tension throughout the work, but his flair for Handel's extraordinary musico-dramatic effects is heard to best advantage in the orgy scene from Act II, which culminates in Handel's fantastic and spooky setting of the ""handwriting on the wall.""  Overall, I would rank Harnoncourt's *Belshazzar* among the most effective and enjoyable period-performance versions of a Handel oratorio--though I suspect that if Gardiner had turned his attention to the piece, he would have produced an even finer realization (perhaps he will revisit Handel at some future date).I am not quite as enthusiastic about Harnoncourt's *Jephtha*. Its chief virtue, shared with this conductor's *Belshazzar*, is the vividly, indeed urgently dramatic rendering of a work that, in lesser hands, can seem overlong, weighed down by stretches of less than top-drawer invention.  A successful recording of *Jephtha* must convey a sense of fateful foreboding, even during the occasional dull patches.  Harnoncourt manages to communicate this sense of inexorable tragedy perhaps better than any conductor before or since.  The great choruses that comment on this tragic trajectory can have rarely been done more effectively, with Handel's text-painting played to the hilt.  The main problem with this performance, then, lies not so much in the interpretation as in the execution.  Both the instrumental playing and the singing could do with greater polish; the listener can be distracted at times by lapses of ensemble and intonation.  The chief problem, however, is the singing of Werner Hollweg in the role of Jepththa.  It's not only that his English diction is frequently unidiomatic; more importantly, his interpretation of the role is so over-the-top as to risk turning this character, with whom the listener should empathize, into a caricature. Histrionics are as unwelcome as blandness in the portrayal of a ""tragic hero"" of this sort.  If Anthony Rolfe Johnson errs on the side of blandness in his portrayal of Jephtha for Marriner, Hollweg is guilty of ""tearing passion to tatters""==quite possibly at Harnoncourt's behest.  Vocally, too, Hollweg often sounds strained and out of his element.  The other soloists offer much compensation, though--especially Gale and Esswood.  Nor can it be said that Hollweg, for all his shortcomings, fails to rivet the listener's attention. Far from it. Too bad Robert Tear wasn't available for this recording!The remastered sound in both works is what we have come to expect from Teldec during this period: clear, robust, with plenty of visceral impact, though at times a little dry and wanting in ambient warmth.Despite flawed casting of the title role in *Jephtha*, these are two of Harnoncourt's most successful Handelian ventures. Yoked together in a slim-line bargain box, they make a tempting proposition for those who may be exploring this repertoire for the first time--or for those who would like to add two very distinctive interpretations to an already ample Handel collection.  In the case of *Belshazzar* there is no better version available; and in the case of *Jephtha* no more intensely dramatic recordings exists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2298EZ25UXQ63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AKMYG0#wasThisHelpful","R2298EZ25UXQ63","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, I failed to take Friedrich Gulda seriously. His penchant for attention-grabbing antics (such as--reputedly-- giving a recital in the nude), and the easy commerce he favored between classical and jazz, pegged him in my thinking as a publicity-seeking crossover artist.That I couldn't have been more mistaken in my assessment was revealed to me a few years ago upon auditioning his altogether remarkable traversal of Bach's WTC for Phillips.  The studio-bound acoustic on that recording was claustrophobic, but the artistry was, in a word, sublime: as to dexterity, fluency and intellectual rigor rivaling Gould; as to depth of insight, surpassing Richter. Subsequently, I went on to acquire his scintillating stereo cycle of Beethoven Sonatas (recently reissued by Brilliant) and several volumes of DG's newer retrospective series (including the amazing, though sonically challenged, ""Mozart Tapes"").Gulda has latterly been exalted to a privileged position in my pantheon of great pianists.  His dalliances with self-promoting mischief notwithstanding, I now regard him as one of the most intellectually as well as technically formidable pianists of the Twentieth Century.His unique gifts--in both classical and jazz idioms--are well in evidence in this modestly-priced, though poorly documented, collection from Membran. By way of a brief review, I shall cut to che chase by prioritizing the items that impressed me most. The Debussy and Ravel pieces, for instance, are tremendously involving; in these works, Gulda always succeeds in finding a narrative thread, a plot-line (so to speak) that consistently enthralls.  This is by no means the light-textured, shimmering impressionistic approach to these French masters we associate with Gieseking.  This is Debussy and Ravel painted, as it were, in vivid primary colors.  The technical mastery is, in a word, stunning.The Mozart and Chopin are nearly as good, though the orchestral playing in the former's K. 449 concerto is poor (wind intonation excruciating), and the latter's e-minor concerto and various solo pieces, though pellucid in articulation are not always as effortlessly natural in rubato as Rubinstein.  Nevertheless, you will never be bored by Gulda's Mozart and Chopin; everything is deeply considered and boldly projected.  The Jazz riffs, ""live from Birdland,"" are hugely enjoyable, and indeed probably in themselves worth the price of admission.The Richard Strauss items -- a delicious lieder recital in which the pianist accompanies Hilde Gueden, and a vigorous *Burleske* with Collins and the LSO -- afford pleasures of a more voluptuous nature. Gueden sings with ecstatic lyricism and coquettish seductiveness, and Gulda supports her with clarity and poise.  The *Burleske*--not a work I usually warm to--is given a rendition of both opulence and irony; just the right combination to convince doubters of this work's enduring value.If you know Gulda's Beethoven from any of his three complete sonata cycles (two in mono, one in stereo), the renditions included in this box will add nothing new to your estimation of Gulda--though they are all superb performances, combining complete technical mastery with extraordinary brio and deep understanding of structure.  Since I have not heard either of his monaural Beethoven cycles, I cannot say whether the performances included here derive from one of these sets, or rather from other sources (live broadcast tapes of particular recitals, for instance).  They do sound like studio recordings, however, even if the sound remains somewhat cloudy and constricted.  The one disappointment for me was the Beethoven C-Major Concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic under Böhm. In the outer movements, the tempos are very slow indeed, so that regardless of the occasional sparkle conveyed by Gulda's pianism, the overall impression is one of lethargy.  Usually Böhm is a reliable, and at times even exciting Beethoven interpreter, but not here.  The slow movement is lovely, but by then I had lost interestPerhaps the biggest surprise for me was the overall quality of the recordings and digital transfers.  Though many are boxy monaural, all are at least tolerable and the majority (particularly the Debussy) are pretty good.  This label has a spotty record when it comes to sonics (some of their ""wallet-boxes"" featuring famous conductors are almost unlistenable due to distorted digital remasterings). In the case of this Gulda box, however, I am happy to report that the remasterings have been undertaken with some care, so that the piano timbre usually sounds natural, without undue filtering making it sound as if recorded ""under water.""In sum, then, pianophiles who want to explore the artistry of Friedrich Gulda would do well to acquire this modestly-priced volume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSVV98U44F0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044DZ1H6#wasThisHelpful","R3JSVV98U44F0W","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I concur with the Amazon reviewers above in their high estimation of the Budapest Quartet and their now-legendary Beethoven interpretations.  However, I much prefer their earlier, monaural Beethoven cycle from 1951-1952.  This earlier cycle was made well before the technical decline evident in many of this ensemble's stereo recordings, including their Beethoven from the 1960's.  In 1952 the Budapest still possessed a unanimity of ensemble and accuracy of intonation that they found increasingly difficult to manage as time went on..The good news is that The Budapest's monaural Beethoven cycle, which to my ears is superior in every respect to their stereo cycle, has been reissued in excellent transfers from United Archives.  Unlike many outfits specializing in archival reissues, this label's production values are outstanding, and their asking price falls within the upper bargain range.  Though recent United Archives releases are not available through Amazon (at least not yet), they are available in the UK via Presto Classical. I advise all prospective purchasers of the Budapest Quartet's Beethoven recordings to check out that website and to consider obtaining this ensemble's magnificent Beethoven cycle from the early LP era.  Their interpretations are even more  probing than in the stereo set, and their playing is far better from a technical standpoint.  The sound, too, is mellower and falls more easily on the ear as good mono often did.The choice is yours, thanks to the (relatively new) United Archives label.  You might also want to check out this label's other highly desirable bargain boxes, which include, to date, Michel Chapuis unsurpassed Bach organ cycle from the 1960's, Bruno Walters NYPO Beethoven cycle (excellently transferred) and Wanda Landowska's complete HMV recordings from the 1930's and early 1940's.

"In Dvorák's splendid Opus 81 Quintet, Richter and the Borodins provide astonishing virtuosity and élan.  No other version I have heard, either on record or in concert, communicates such passionate involvement: the result is quite breathtaking. What I miss, however, is charm, and that folksy quality which is such an essential aspect of Dvorak's muse.  Many listeners will favor a more relaxed approach that gives the music room to breathe, to sparkle, and to laugh.In the seldom-heard Opus 5 Quintet, however, these artists give what must be regarded as a near definitive performance. If you have not heard the piece, you will be surprised at the eloquence, inventiveness, and vivacity that Richter and the Borodins discover in this youthful work.  The slow movement, in particular, is gorgeous, and gorgeously played here; it would be hugely popular if it were better known.These are live performances caught on the wing in 1982, and that may account both for the tendency to hyperactivity in Op. 81 and for the dryish acoustic throughout, which seldom flatters the strings (though Richter's contribution is well caught).In the end, I would hesitate to recommend this version of Op. 81 to listeners unfamiliar with the work, or those who are in the market for a ""basic library selection.""  If you already own, say, Curzon/Vienna or Firkusny/Ridge, then this unusual interpretation might make an ideal ""second version"" to add to your collection.  On the other hand, listeners interested in acquiring a recording of Opus 5 might well prefer this sizzling account to the competition (a fine, though more sober, rendition by Firkusny and the Ridge Quartet).  So there is some ambivalence on my part toward this release, even though it captures what must have been a memorable occasion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31984XIMMA8VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E8N7QC#wasThisHelpful","R31984XIMMA8VI","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this set when it when it was first reissued on CD because I wanted to acquaint myself with the earlier Schubert quartets, and this was an inexpensive way to obtain recordings of this neglected repertoire.  All chamber music lovers know Schubert's great ""final three""  (nos. 13-15)  and the fragment known as the *Quartettsatz* in c-minor (usually called ""no. 12"").  More adventurous listeners might also know the earlier g-minor and E-flat major works, as they sometimes turn up in concert programs and there have been several recordings over the years apart from complete cycles.  But few of us are familiar with the other early works, most of them apprentice pieces, through the composition of which Schubert was learning his craft--and doing so with a precociousness that rivals the young Mozart and the young Mendelssohn.The Melos Quartet made these recordings in the early 1970's when they were at their peak (they also did fine traversals of the Beethoven, Cherubini, Schumann, Brahms and Mozart ""Haydn"" Quartets).  They were (are still?) an illustrious ensemble with a distinctively sweet collective tone characterized by ""tight"" vibrato.  They favored clear textures (the inner parts are almost always audible), straightforward--even at times rather plain--phrasing, scrupulous adherence to the musical text, and a wide dynamic range that often resulted in sharp, even abrupt, dynamic contrasts. Their choice of tempo is usually sensible--neither too fast nor too slow. They don't always dig very deep beneath the surface of the music, but those surfaces emerge as carefully articulated and thoroughly polished.  With the Melos Quartet we encounter seemingly effortless artistry that never calls attention to itself.These qualities are particularly well suited to the ""artless"" lyricism of Schubert's early quartets.  In the apprentice works, the Melos don't fall into the trap of inflating what are frequently rather fragile structures, or trying to plumb depths that the young composer had not yet fathomed.  Early Scubert presents the listener with youthful zeal and uncomplicated lyricism, and what at times can only be called a gauche graciousness.As Schubert matured--and he did so with astonishing rapidity during his adolescent years--he succeeded in writing more idiomatically for the quartet medium, expanding and clarifying his understanding of musical form, and cultivating that instantly recognizable pathos which trades on harmonic ambiguities and sudden shifts of mood.  The Melos convey these trends particularly well in the attractive transitional works in E major, E-Flat major and g-minor.In the Quartettesatz and the final trilogy, other ensembles have savored the pathos more poignantly and conveyed the scope of Schubert's vastly expanded appropriation of form more cogently,  but the Melos' tight ensemble, incisive attack, and clarity of texture nevertheless succeed in bringing these works vividly to life. On the other hand,  one might wish for a more leisurely, gracious approach to these great works, such as certain Viennese ensembles cultivated during the middle decades of the 20th Century.  I am engaged by the Melos's traversal of the late Quartets, but rarely charmed (where Schubert intends to charm), terrified (where Schubert intends to terrify), or profoundly moved  (as Schubert can do when he is bringing the listener face-to-face with the human condition).So the Melos Schubert cycle has undoubted merit, even if one would not turn first to this ensemble in Schubert's fully mature quartets.  Another limitation is the remastered sound--at least to my ears.  The original LP's offered clean, nicely focused sound that was slightly ""top-heavy"" or treble-intensive as recordings on this label tended to be at the time.  The remastering has done nothing to redress this perceptible imbalance, but rather has exacerbated it by thinning out the violin tone and further emaciating the cello tone. As a result, there are occasional bouts of uncomfortably harsh sound in fortissimo passages.  This sonic limitation is not so severe as to preclude a general recommendation, however.  So let us call this four and one-half stars: a first-rate bargain featuring solid musicianship and clear-headed if at times overly studious renderings of Schubert's important contribution to the Quartet medium.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DYG0CCDTIQOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002DEH3#wasThisHelpful","R2DYG0CCDTIQOX","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For once, there seems to be something like an emerging consensus among Amazon reviewers.  Haitink's early Bruckner cycle's greatest virtue is also its greatest liability--namely, a plainspoken approach that conveys the structural integrity of these awe-inspiring scores with a minimum of fuss.  Haitink resists manifold temptations to hype the drama or disrupt the flow by overmanipulation of tempo or agogic distortion.  In other words, this is the Bruckner cycle to purchase if you don't like interventionist conductors.  In some moods, but not all, this is exactly what I am after in Bruckner. Haitink's early efforts are particularly conducive to in-depth study whose aim is to discern the long-range structural logic behind the notes.  However, when I want to be edified, exalted, renewed in mind and spirit (all of which Bruckner's music can accomplish in his listeners), I will turn to other interpreters--and, yes, to those who favor a more interventionist approach  (Furtwängler, Karajan, Celibidache,Jochum  even Solti).  I might also add that there are non-interventionist Brucknerians who arguably succeed better at the ""plain vanilla"" approach than Hainink--such as van Beinum, Schurcht, Böhm and Stein.With these qualifications in mind, I can nevertheless recommend Haitink's set as a very good place to begin an encounter with this mind-boggling yet elusive music.  He rarely puts a foot wrong in setting forth the letter of the score, and succeeds surprisingly well in conveying the spirit, too, by focusing on, and scrupulously realizing, what Bruckner has written.  One can quibble about Hatink's choice of tempo here and there (the brisk romp through the first movements of 6 and 8, for instance), but rarely does he do anything that could excite controversy or distract one's attention from the music--and that is where one's attention should be focused when first encountering Bruckner.  Nor can Haitink's Bruckner  be considered dull, for everywhere he and his players approach these works with evident affection.And what players!  The Concertgebouw is, in my estimation, the ideal Bruckner orchestra.  They ""paint"" the music with bold, richly textured, primary colors. The Concertgebouw of this period, in Bruckner,  is the aural equivalent of Rembrandt.  In fact, I am disposed to recommend this set to neophytes and veterans alike just for the sake of reveling in this gorgeous panoply of orchestral color!  No other European ensemble--not even the VPO or the BPO--can quite match the Concertgebouw in this repertoire.There follows a brief run-down on each of the symphonies:No. ""0"":  One advantage of this set is its inclusion of the ""Zeroica"" as it is sometimes whimsically called.  A surprisingly mature work, considering its extra-canonical status.  Haitink does it some justice--I believe this was its first stereo recording--but others have discovered more depth and conveyed a greater dramatic urgency.  I would recommend Barenboim/DG, Solti or Skrowaczewski--all of which convey far greater character than Haitink.No. 1:  Hatink gives a lucid, refreshingly direct and energetic account which must be numbered among the best ever recorded.  This is the Linz version, which most Brucknerians prefer to his later redaction.  Not better than Karajan and Solti, but on a par perhaps.No. 2:  One of the handful of ""perfect"" Bruckner recordings.  Haitink coaxes absolutely glorious playing from the Concergebouworkest here.  The Haas edition is used.No. 3:  One of the earliest to be recorded in Haitink's cycle (1963), and one of the best, interpretively.  The somewhat rambling structure of the 1878 edition notwithstanding, Haitink manages to hold everything together with remarkable cogency.  He also conveys a fine sense of mystery in the appropriate places, such as the opening of the first movement.  The great passage in the finale where Bruckner combines solemn chorale with skittish polka is better realized elsewhere, but you can't have everything.  Overall, one of the better Thirds--though I prefer the 1889 edition under Böhm, Jochum, and Schuricht.No. 4:  Another lovely performance, worthy to set alongside Haitink's near-definitive account of the Second.  Beautifuly played, serene, yet with plenty of brio where that is required.  The finale is held together well (no easy task) and the hunting-horn scherzo is sufficiently robust without being over-driven.No. 5:  The nostalgia factor colors my judgment here:  this recording was this listener's first encounter with Bruckner, way back in the LP era.  When I first heard the magical passage in the first movement where Bruckner intertwines a serpentine thematic fragment within a hushed, pizzicato chorale, I knew that I had encountered the Transcendent via the art of music--and that Bruckner was the composer who would provide such encounters regularly.  Since that time I have heard virtually every recording of what remains my favorite Bruckner symphony, and Haitink's Concertgebouw version always comes out at or near the top.  This is one work which suffers from over-inflation or overemphasis.  Haitink knows that a reliable tourguide is all one needs in this vast cathedral of sound.  Much though I love Furtwängler's minatory account and Karajan's riveting exegesis, it is Haitink to which I return most often for renewal.No. 6:  An admirably sound and straightforward performance.  Too little majesty in the first movement, but Haitink achieves sublimity in the slow movement.  I prefer Klemperer, Stein and the under-appreciated Bongartz in this work.No. 7:  An uplifting account of Bruckner's most accessible symphony--until you hear Karajan/EMI and then it is hard to settle for what will sound, in comparison, like dogged literalism.  Haitink's Seventh is better than that, of course, but the best is, as they say, the enemy of the merely good.No. 8:  This was the first to be recorded in Haitink's Concertgebouw Bruckner cycle, and it reflects a certain immaturity on the part of a then very young conductor.  If this had been my first encounter with Bruckner, or with this, presumably greatest of his symphonies, I might not have understood what all the fuss is about.  Haitink is too brisk and too literal adequately to convey the agony and ecstasy of this remarkable music.  So everyone's advice to prospective purchasers of this set is that  you will need another version of the mightly Eighth. Karajan/Vienna is a perennial favorite (and rightly so), but for me Furtwängler owns this symphony. If you want to hear Haitink in just this symphony, I would recommend his later Concertgebouw recording which proceeds more slowly and meditatively throughout.  Haitink as usual, favors the Haas edition.No. 9:  Haitink is outstanding here.  I have not heard his later, Vienna recording, but this Concertgebouw version is as good as it gets.  The cumulative power of this sober, even at times introverted, reading is ultimately more devastating than many more overtly dramatic accounts, such as those by Karajan and Solti.  Haitink is surpassed, in my estimation, only by Furtwangler and Walter (two very different, and complementary, accounts).All told, then, this set provides a more than reliable introduction to the composer. Haitink is definitely on Bruckner's wave-length, even if he is only intermittently inspired.  His versions of 1, 2, and 5 are perennial favorites with this listener, and his Ninth must be reckoned among the best.  In the end, perhaps, it is the Concertgebouworkest that provides potential purchasers with an incentive to invest in this box, and the recording engineers have done justice to this ensemble's unique character.  The remastered sound is clearly focused and wide-ranging with plenty of ambient warmth.  Only the earliest recordings (nos. 3 & 8) betray their age with slightly thinner string and brass sonorities.  There is no other Bruckner cycle that surpasses this one for the sheer beauty of the orchestral playing.NOTE:  Universal will soon be releasing a new ""Haitink Symphony Edition,"" which will comprise all of his complete symphony cycles by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler, Schumann and Tchaikovsky.  It will be offered in a bargain box at a very affordable price.  Collectors interested in Haitink's Bruckner might well consider this new offering, if more extensive repertoire by this conductor is desired.  I have heard all of these symphony cycles except the Beethoven, and can testify that they are all superbly played and recorded, and the interpretations are consistently involving without ever getting in the way of the music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IYBKX9SUAMU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009A41VU#wasThisHelpful","R2IYBKX9SUAMU8","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Schuricht was a venerable figure among German conductors of the mid-20th Century, though his recorded legacy is relatively unknown today. That is unfortunate, since he was a remarkably perceptive conductor, worthy to be placed alongside the greatest of his generation.  He favored straightforward, clear-headed interpretations entirely without artifice or  glamor-mongering.  His conductorial manner was, in a word, gentlemanly. Whether the composer be Baroque, Classical, Romantic or Modern, Schuricht ensures that the music is set forth with utter naturalness.  Some critics have complained of a certain dourness, and I can see their point. If you're looking for visceral excitement or monumentality, these qualities are generally absent in a Schuricht performance.  Instead, you will find a certain intimacy of expression that makes it seem as if the music is speaking directly to you, the listener. This cherishable set  from Scribendum contains the bulk of the studio recordings Schuricht made in the early stereo era for the ""Concert Hall"" label, with several European orchestras which he led or guest-conducted during this period.Not every item in this set is equally well performed. The  SDR and SWR were hardly in the front rank among German ensembles at this time, and the same holds for the ""Paris Opera Orchestra.""  On the other hand, the Bavarian Radio Symphony and the Vienna State Opera Orchestra acquit themselves well for Schuricht.  The Schubert ""Great C-Major"" with the Süddeutsche Rundfunk orchestra sounds rather creaky in places, and the Brahms Fourth with the Bavarian forces will hardly replace Fürtwangler or Toscanini in anyone's affections.  However, the Bruckner and Mendelssohn (both specialties of the conductor) are splendid, with the Wagner, Strauss, Schumann, and Weber not far behind. The Paris orchestra gives fizzing renditions of three Mozart symphonies; these are wholly delightful (despite some slipshod ensemble and the absence of exposition repeats), not least because of the distinctive timbre of the Parisian winds,  Best of all, perhaps, are the Bach ""Brandenburg Concertos"" crisply and enthusiastically played by a fine Swiss chamber ensemble.  These are decidedly jolly readings, with robust but not inflated textures, snappy rhythmic articulation and incisive attack.  There is a fair amount of appropriately executed ornamentation, and the solo playing is first-rate.  The four concerti grossi by Handel (performed by a reduced BRSO) are also enjoyably light-hearted, even if the playing here is not quite as alert, nor the recording as vivid as in the Bach (the presumed harpsichord continuo is inaudible).The Bruckner Seventh deserves special mention, given Schuricht's strong reputation as an advocate of this composer.  Schuricht manages successfully to convey this symphony's lofty and expasnive qualities with a minimum of fuss at flowing tempos.  Though the tempo of the Adagio may well seem too brisk for some listeners, Schuricht's effortlessly natural phrasing and intuitive grasp of structure amply compensate for any loss of gravitas.  Though this is a very fine performance, it doesn't quite measure up to Schuricht's best Bruckner recordings (such as his EMI studio versions of the composer's Third, Eighth and Ninth symphonies with the VPO, or the live broadcast performances from Stuttgart of the Fifth, Eighth and Ninth recently released in Hänssler Classic's Schuricht edition).  The problem is that the Hague Philharmonic is not quite up to the exigent demands of this monumental score.  The string timbre tends to be on the pallid side;and the wind and brass playing are, in a word, undistinguished.  Too bad Schuricht never got around to recording this work with the VPO as part of his Bruckner series for EMI.  Fans of the conductor, however, will appreciate the opportunity of hearing the conductor's distinctive take on this work, and are urged to listen past the imperfections in orchestral execution.The recording quality throughout this set is reasonably good, though sometimes congested (as in the Schubert Ninth) and/or a bit cloudy (as in the Handel and Bruckner). Whatever the limitations, however, we must be grateful to Scribendum for resuscitating these historic recordings, long out of circulation. Overall, this gives the listener a splendid introduction to this ""gentle giant"" among Twentieth Century conductors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKQH6ELUZIJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009I8EZQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HKQH6ELUZIJW","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No need to waste words:  this is simply the most beautiful Liszt recital I have ever heard.  No, it is not the last word on barnstorming virtuosity; Kempff was not a showman, though he possessed a technique sufficiently secure (even at relatively advanced age)  to surmount Liszt's more demanding passages.  But showmanship is utterly beside the point in these mostly introspective pieces anyway.  Kempff had exactly the right temperament to convey the sense of rapture--whether pastoral, sensuous-erotic, or spiritual--Liszt evokes.  Kempff's sensitivity to atmosphere, nuance and color in this remarkable music has never been surpassed (except perhaps by his own monaural recordings for Decca/London).  Suffice it to say that this recital is the perfect antidote for Lisztians who have overdosed on Cziffra--Kempff's antithesis in this repertoire (and I say this as one who admires the former's coruscating pianism no less that the latter's serene musicianship).The sound is as luminous and gentle on the ear as is the playing; DG's engineers have really done a splendid job in giving new digital life to an analogue original that was rather dry and top-heavy (as DG's recordings tended to be during the LP era.  There is now a rich, resonant (though not overpowering) bass, a superbly focused middle register, and a sparkling treble.If you have never heard Kempff's unique, and uniquely satisfying, Liszt, here is a golden opportunity not to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239A6206V60SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CPJC3K#wasThisHelpful","R239A6206V60SL","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may be a sign of the times -- and by no means a positive sign -- that top-rank classical recordings of recent provenance are being anthologized in huge omnibus collections of this type, and sold for a mere pittance. In any case, what might be an alarming cultural bell-weather constitutes a great boon for collectors--veterans and neophytes alike.For here we have all of Gardiner's Bach recordings for the DG/Archiv label (from which the distinguished conductor was subsequently, and inexplicably, dropped) amounting to something like a *Summa* of Bach's church music.  Included are the B-minor Mass, the St. John and St. Matthew Passions, the Christmas Oratorio, the Magnificat, and sundry Cantatas (some of which are studio recordings, others of which are live performances hailing from Gardiner's celebrated ""Bach Pilgrimage"" of 1999-2000).  Listeners in the market for the complete cantata cycle will not find it here, though three dozen works in that genre which are included constitute a splendid representative sampling (with a good balance between well-known and relatively obscure cantatas).What can be said about the performances, live or studio, which has not already been said?  Gardiner is one of our very finest early-music specialists; but more importantly he is a superlative musician, whose understanding of this composer is as deep as it is comprehensive.  Moreover, his choir, soloists,  and orchestral ensemble clearly partake of their leader's dedicated and enlivening musicianship.  The four large-scale works included in this package date from a period in which Gardiner was consolidating  his reputation as a Bachian and an early-music ""superstar."" Gardiner's Bach series for DG/Archiv began with the B-Minor Mass in 1982; that recording was considered near-definitive then, and it has not lost its luster in the intervening years. Except for some thin-toned and uncharacteristically tentative solo singing, this is as fine a traversal of this work as you will find on record; it still reigns supreme in the historically-informed category.  Perhaps if he had it to do over agian, Gardiner would not choose to alternate soloists and ripieno choir in many of the ""choral"" movements, but that practice makes this interpretation distinctive  (while favoring textural clarity in fugal expositions).  With the two Passions and the *Christmas Oratorio* Gardiner's series went from strength to strength, so that these recordings came to dominate the field during the remainder of the 1980's.  The solo singing in these latter three performances is particularly distinguished. and the late Anthony Rolfe-Johnson's sensitive rendition of the Evangelist should be singled out for special praise.  The choral singing, too, is tremendous, matching precision with expressive nuance.  I have a particular fondness for Gardiner's *Christmas Oratorio*, whose winning combination of vital energy and celebratory splendor has yet to be surpassed among historically-informed versions.The Cantatas, which followed in the 1990's and the Millennium Year, share similar virtues.  If at times one longs for greater simplicity of utterance--such as one finds in the old Fritz Werner or Felix Prohaska recordings from the LP era (despite their obvious lapses of musicological correctness)--Gardiner's rhythmic vitality and almost unfailingly intelligent pointing of detail generally silence any criticism.  If Gardiner comes dangerously close to ""loving the music to death,"" better that than dry academicism.Twp recordings anthologized here--the Magnificat and the soprano-solo Cantata BWV 51-- were originally released on the Phillips label in 1983.  They make a welcome reappearance:  Emma Kirkby's soaring, if slender-voiced, account of BWV 51 set a new standard in this work, and few if any ""early music"" singers since have approached, much less surpassed, her achievement.  Gardiner's *Magnificat* is both as ebullient and dramatic as one would have expected; and, once again, few period=performance versions have rivaled it since it appeared.Despite the diversity of recording venues and the many improvements in digital technology over nearly three decades, the quality of the sound throughout this 22-CD set is of consistently high quality.  This time around, however (I have known most of these recordings for years in previous incarnations), I began to notice an excessive brightness,and perhaps a certain two-dimensional quality, in the early-digital recordings from the 1980's, which becomes more conspicuous when compared with the Cantata recordings from the later decade.  The later are altogether richer, mellower, with a more spacious ""soundstage"" (this is especially the case with the live recordings from 1999-2000).  But one shouldn't make too much of this; few listeners will have cause to complain of sonic limitations, given the immense spiritual uplift she or he will be enjoying!DG/Universal has informed us that this is a limited edition.  All the more incentive, then, to snap this up while it is available.  Seasoned collectors may well own many of these recordings already; if so, the price is so low as to justify purchase for the sake of those which you may not have heard.  Listeners new to Bach or to classical music will surely come to regard this remarkable bargain box as a cornerstone of their collection.  Those in the latter category may well experience an irresistible urge to acquire Gardiner's entire Cantata cycle (issued on the Soli Deo Gloria label).Call it Irresistible Grace...","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ON0WR5H3ME0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003647BUE#wasThisHelpful","R1ON0WR5H3ME0","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree wholeheartedly with T. Beers's review, that Leinsdorf's Prokofiev was ""nonpareil.""  Leinsdorf remains an underappreciated conductor. Critics have often complained that his interpretations were cold, severe, intellectualized, even pedestrian, while giving him credit for evoking supremely disciplined playing from the ensembles he conducted.  As a veteran concertgoer from the Leinsdorf years in Boston, I can testify that, at his best, Leinsdorf was a tremendous interpreter of everything from Viennese classicism to the Second Viennese School.  Like Szell, Reiner and Solti, he preferred to exercise maximal control rather than opting for a more genial, laissez-faire style.  He learned quite a bit, I wager, from his experience as Toscanini's assistant.  However, like those conductors--who were also accused of being hard-nosed disciplinarians--he had an intuitive grasp of orchestral color and a great sense of dramatic timing.  His best recordings convey a heady exuberance and confident grasp of musical architecture that are always put in service of the composer and ensemble.Leinsdorf was particularly adept and making even the most difficult, ""modernistic"" scores tractable to the general public.  Prokofiev is a case in point.  The enduring fascination of this composer comes largely from his ability to combine, in creative tension, fury and tenderness, brutal primitivism and elegant neoclassicism, spiky dissonance and bittersweet lyricism.  Leinsdorf understands this tension fully, and conveys it more successfully than any other conductor of which I am aware.The four Symphonies Leinsdorf got to record--one wonders what corner-office executive nixed the prospect of a complete cycle--are simply outstanding.  The Second and Third are among Prokofiev's most difficult; in these works, the the composer fully lives up to his reputation as *enfant terrible* of modernism.  In both, Leinsdorf and the BSO take no prisoners in their vehement abandon to Prokofievian primitivism, while allowing the occasional hints of balletic playfulness and passages of soaring lyricism tell just as fully. Leinsdorf's recordings of the Fifth and Sixth have rightly been accorded ""classic status."" Leinsdorf's bracing and incisive Fifth emphasizes the work's neoclassical spirit, unlike the more romanticized interpretations of Karajan and Ormandy (fine though they are).  Leinsdorf's approach is closer to that of Ansermet, though he has a far finer orchestra to work worth. Leinsdorf's  Sixth, on the other hand, brings this troubled work in line with Shostakovich, even Mahler, by underscoring its unsettling combination of biting irony and tragic weight. A magnificent, and exhausting, rendition of what may well be Prokofiev's greatest symphony.As for the five Piano Concertos with Browning: I know of no finer versions on record.  Browning's virtuosity is as stunning as his perceptiveness is enlightening. Browning is not content merely to toss off the busy passagework as if it were a technical exercise--a temptation into which too many pianists fall in this repertoire--but rather, he takes pains to convey the musical meaning behind the notes.  Leinsdorf is with him all the way, delighted in the interplay--sometimes combative, sometimes seductive, frequently comic--between soloist and orchestra, and undoubtedly reveling in the brilliant colors of Prokofiev's scoring.  For me, this set of the piano concertos eclipses all of the competition--with the sole exception of Graffman/Szell in nos. 1 & 3 (performances with similar virtues), and perhaps Richter/Wisloki in 5.  The two Violin Concertos are also oustanding; the underrated Friedman (a student of Heifetz) dazzling in the D-Major; the young Perlman mellower, but no less assured, in the g-minor.Mr. Beers complained of the inexplicable omission of Leinsdorf's Scythian Suite and the Symphony-Concerto for Cello and Orchestra. Their loss is lamentable, but at least we are given a rousing Liutenant Kijé and a substantial selection from *Romeo and Juliet*.  The latter is beautifully performed, and has the considerable advantage of  closely following action of the play (unlike Prokofiev's suites from the complete ballet).Throughout these six CD's, the sound, to my ears, is extraordinarily vivid, well balanced, solidly focused, with a bass register that frequently causes seismic cataclysms (yet, miraculously, without distortion).  I did notice, along with Mr. Beers, a momentary clouding of the texture at the beginning of the First Piano Concerto.  I can also understand why the other reviewer found the sound too aggressive.  But better an excess of immediacy in Prokofiev than a distant wash of orchestral sonority.  In short, I found the engineering on the whole as outstanding as the performances.If you enjoy Prokofiev--and certainly there were few twentieth-century composers with such a distinctive, and immediately recognizable, tone of voice--you must have this set.  Even if you own recordings of some or all of these works, you should add this to your collection.  Given the modest cost (especially in comparison to previous reissues of the Symphonies and Piano  Concertos on Testament), I will not complain of the absence of documentation, apart from movement/track listings on the back of the cardboard slipcases in which individual CDs are housed.This set is irresistible; don't hesitate to acquire it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI65I0LS34VJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6P2LA#wasThisHelpful","RI65I0LS34VJO","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solti's Bruckner cycle from the early digital era has come in for some rather harsh criticism over the years.  Reviewers in the usual periodicals have denounced Solti's Bruckner as harsh, garish, vulgar, and superficial; the CSO has similarly been stereotyped as having exactly the wrong collective sonority for this composer--too cold, too brassy, to hard-edged.Of course, it's always possible to find recordings (or recall live performances) that fit the stereotypes (my first candidate would be Solti's digital account of  Debussy's *Nocturnes* from about the same period).  Here, however, is a Bruckner Seventh that will make you think twice about type-casting either Solti or the CSO.  It is an absolutely gorgeous account of the work: as atmospheric and contemplative as one would desire (the tempo surprisingly broad, but effective) in the first movement; as profoundly and nobly tragic as any on record in the Adagio (where Solti gives the music an appropriately Wagnerian cast--it is a threnody on the death of that composer, after all).  The Scherzo is delightfully rustic, and the finale exalted in its peroration.  Throughout, every section of the CSO play with devotion, nuance and the virtuosity for which they are justly celebrated.  The recording is a bit bass-heavy, but otherwise vivid, well focused, and sufficiently ample to accommodate Solti's apocalyptic climaxes (yes, I suppose, true to form!).If you are an avid Brucknerian, or are just interested in hearing a superb performance by one of the great American orchestras, you should seek out this recording--though not, perhaps, in preference to Karajan's EMI Seventh, which, at least for me, remains the benchmark in this work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BPVR1H57YZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008FJF5#wasThisHelpful","R37BPVR1H57YZS","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have loved this recording of the *St. Matthew Passion* since I first heard it on LP during  my college days.  Gönnenwein strikes an ideal balance between the traditional ""Kappellmeister"" approach of Richter and Klemperer--which could be oppressively weighty in texture and rhythmically square--and the smaller-scaled, musicologically correct performances which are the norm today.  The conductor favors a lyrical rather than a dramatic interpretation of the work. Though the great moments are by no means slighted, inwardness predominates over monumentality and brilliance.  The modest choral forces sing with firm tone and reasonably crisp diction; contrapuntal textures remain clear, thanks to Gönnenwein's intelligent direction.  An outstanding roster of soloists is deployed for the arias, though I have some reservations about Altmeyer's Evangelist (he whines at higher dynamic levels and tends to bark when he reaches the top of his range) and Crass's Jesus (too stentorian, insufficiently  nuanced). The instrumental ensemble plays with accuracy, warmth and a good sense of style; all of the wind and string obbligati are well played, often beautifully shaped, if with too much legato phrasing.  The digitally remastered recording from the late Sixties is pleasing--well focused, with a lot of ambient warmth and only occasional hints of a metallic edge on the voices at higher dynamic levels.Before you invest in this reasonably economical 3-CD set, however, be aware that EMI has just released (as of April, 2011) a slim-line bargain box containing a treasure trove of ""traditional"" Bach recordings culled from that company's extensive back catalog (and ludicrously hyped as ""timeless performances"").  For just over twice the cost of EMI's previous reissue of Gönnenwein's  *St. Matthew Passion* you will also get that conductor's equally fine *St. John Passion* and *Easter Oratorio*, Ledger's oh-so-Anglican, but characterful *Christmas Oratorio* and *Ascension Oratorio* with Kings College choir, Jochum's superb digital *B-Minor Mass*, Barenboim's cherishable *Magnificat* from early in his conducting career, and a ""historic"" rendition of Cantata BWV 147 featuring the Geraint Jones Singers (sounding as if they'd rather be singing Purcell) and none other than Dame Joan Sutherland (sounding as if she'd rather be singing Alcina--or Norma).  I recently ordered this set from a distributor overseas (Amazon.com stateside does not yet carry it) and have been enjoying it immensely since its arrival.  Even if you own multiple versions of these works, it constitutes an irresistible bargain for which I'd opt in preference to the reissued St. Matthew on offer here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XZSC9IZ2E1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UZ4EMK#wasThisHelpful","R16XZSC9IZ2E1X","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that the Talich Quartet's survey of the Mozart Quartets is no longer available, this bargain box from DG is probably the best way to acquire the complete cycle at a modest cost.  The Amadeus Quartet recorded extensively over the four decades of their existence (1947-1987).  They gave us multiple versions of the best-known Mozart quartets, and many critics would argue that their earlier, monaural recordings of these works were fresher and more deeply considered than their later, stereo efforts (which is what we have in this DG Collectors Edition).  As a longstanding fan of the Amadeus Quartet, I have heard all of their Mozart recordings, and am of the opinion that their later recordings are by no means inferior. The versions of nos. 14-23 included in this Collectors Edition are altogether superb: invigorating, yet gracious readings that manage to convey both the playfulness and the pathos of the music without undue frivolousness or schmaltz.  The Amadeus' collective tone is robust, with a pronounced vibrato to which some listeners (particularly the historically-minded) might object.  I find their sweet-singing tone enchanting, though some might find it cloying.  The early quartets (among which there are a surprising number of near-masterpieces) are given no more or less than the weight they deserve; their rococo charms are undeniable in these light-hearted, but never condescending renditions.There is only one point on which I would caution prospective purchasers:  The Amadeus are not generous with repeats.  If it is important to you to hear the expositions of sonata-form movements twice, then you should probably pass up this set, fine though it is in other respects.The recordings have been effectively remastered; the sound is exceptionally vivid, with instruments closely observed.  The upper register is smooth, not too strident at higher dynamic levels (as some DG recordings of chamber music during this period could be).  In general the ten mature quartets, though recorded earlier (1960's), sound marginally more natural to my ears than the early quartets, which (if memory serves me correctly) are of 1970's vintage.  No grumbles, then, about the sonics--this is one of DG's better efforts from the LP era.So if you're in the market for a complete Mozart cycle, do consider this set, which is attractively presented (though notes are rather skimpy) and economically priced.  I prefer the Amadeus to the Hagens in this repertoire (the latter's Mozart recordings are also available in a bargain box from DG); I find the latter's interpretations superficial, though not everyone will agree with me on that point.  The Amadeus were one of the great ensembles of their era, and I'm delighted that their Mozart is still available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCZLW2DGO6M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033QEQGW#wasThisHelpful","R3UCZLW2DGO6M3","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amadeus Quartet's long and distinguished career has been well served during the CD era.  As far as I can tell, virtually all of their Westminster, EMI and DG recordings from roughly 1950-1987 have been reissued, repeatedly and in diverse configurations.  This is heartening, since it bespeaks an abiding appreciation among listeners for great chamber-music performances.The Haydn recordings anthologized in this inexpensive Collectors Edition are stereo recordings made during the 1970's.  Though their monaural versions of selected quartets from Haydn's ouvre convey a spirit, sparkle and affection less consistently caught in their later DG recordings of the complete quartets from opus 51 onward, the latter are by no means inferior.  Indeed, anyone coming to this music for the first time via these splendid Amadeus performances will be astonished at the fecundity of the composer's genius and the rich, glowing sonorities evoked by this magnificent ensemble.  Listeners who don't mind monaural recordings are well advised to check out the Amadeus's earlier recordings of Haydn, Schubert and Brahms, which have recently been reissued in an even more inexpensive bargain box from Brilliant (though the Haydn selection doesn't include nearly as many quartets as does DG's Collectors Edition).  However, if a more ample survey and more up-to-date sonics are required (and DG's remastered sound is as warm and vividly ""present"" as one could desire), the Collectors Edition is the one to go for.  Among the performances included herein are unsurpassed accounts of opus 54, 55, 71, 74, 77 and 103.  For some reason, the Amadeus are marginally less persuasive--at least to my ears--in Opus 51 (the ""Seven Last Words of Christ""), and in the six best-known Quartets Opus 76--all of which seem somewhat ""overheated,"" and at times slightly heavy handed as well.  But I wouldn't make too much of these shortcomings, given the refulgent tone and involving interpretations this estimable quartet provide.If you find the Amadeus's approach to Viennese classicism congenial, then you might also want to consider their complete Mozart quartet cycle (now also available in super-bargain range), their renditions of that composer's six String Quintets, as well as their Beethoven cycle (the latter of which was, in its day, a top recommendation for the Beethoven quartets, and which still wears well after nearly fifty years of continuous availability!).  DG have also reissued the Amadeus's earlier, and sprightlier, Mozart recordings from the monaural era in a more expensive, but cherishable, limited edition.No chamber-music lover should be without an ample representation of the Haydn quartets--the greatest of which are among that composers most sublime creations--and this inexpensive Amadeus collection is a perfect place to begin.  If subsequently you are interested in hearing the entire cycle (over eighty works--an amazing legacy), several fine complete editions are available--from the Kodály, Aeolian and Angeles Quartets, among others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8J55DU7QVTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QBXFSG#wasThisHelpful","R1U8J55DU7QVTD","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While complete editions of Schubert's piano sonatas are readily available (even in the bargain price range), surveys of his entire output for piano are quite rare. Indeed, this current offering from Brilliant may well be the only one.  For one who died so young, Schubert was an enormously prolific composer, and that holds for his piano works as well as for his lieder.  Many music lovers are familiar with all twenty-one of his sonatas, the Impromptus, Moments Musicaux and Wanderer Fantasie, but few of us know the blooming, buzzing confusion of Waltzes, Ecossaises, Scherzi, variation sets and other incidental pieces (not to mention fragments) which inhabit the less-frequented regions of Otto Deutsch's Catalog.But here they all are--minus a handful of waltzes (no great loss), one or two fragments, and the *Grazer* Fantasie (considered spurious perhaps)--in one 14-CD box, well played and recorded.  These recordings derive from a series originally issued on the now-defunct Denon label.  Though I haven't heard those CDs, I surmise that everything originally released by Denon has been included here, and that the sound has not been tampered with.How to sum up such a vast collection and such a remarkable achievement by one artist?  On the basis of my auditioning, suffice it to say that Dalberto is always a thoughtful, sensitive Schubertian, alive to this composer's unique sound-world, his chimerical shifts of mood, and to the darker currents that course beneath the surface of the music.  In the Sonatas, Dalberto takes all of the essential repeats, plays fragmentary movments *as* fragments, chooses sensible tempos (sometimes on the slowish side, but nothing like the distensions found in some of Richter's performances), employs agogics and rubato to telling effect, and keeps knotty textures reasonably clear.  He manages to convey the intimacy as well as the majesty of Schubert's writing for piano.  Nothing sounds forced, everything flows effortlessly and naturally.If in certain works (such as the Final Trilogy of Sonatas), other artists plumb greater depths (Lupu, Curzon, Richter, Brendel), Dalberto is by no means eclipsed by these more famous Schubertians.Much the same can be said concerning the shorter works.  The Impromptus and Moments Musicaux are quite lovely--worthy to be compared with Perahia, Brendel, Frankl (whose 3-CD Vox Box of Schubert piano pieces is a perennial favorite with me -- a real sleeper, worth searching out) among many others.  Though Dalberto's Wanderer-Fantasie is impeccably played, it does not quite efface memories of Rubinstein, Richter, Pollini and others who have brought an altogether higher order of mastery to this technically challenging work.  Dalberto caresses the many dances, variations, scherzi and other short pieces with just the right amount of affection, without weighing down what are frequently light-hearted trifles (the Ecossaises must hold some kind of record for brevity among classical compositions--some last for a mere twenty seconds!).Thus there is far more to praise than to criticize in this massive survey.  That having been said, however, I must note one potentially irritating feature of Dalberto's playing: his tone, so alluring in quieter passages, tends to harden at higher dynamic levels, acquiring an unpleasant steely edge.  Compare Dalberto with Lupu, for instance, and you'll hear a significant difference in tone and touch in the passages under consideration that can't be chalked up entirely to recording techniques, venues and instruments used (though they may have played a role in emphasizing the occasional edginess of Dalberto's playing).  On the other hand, this reservation--though not entirely a minor one for me--shouldn't deter collectors from obtaining this reasonably-priced set (even more reasonably priced if you purchase it from websites abroad).  In general, the many positive aspects of  Dalberto's playing, as well as the merit of his interpretations (which display a natural affinity for the composer), make this Brilliant Box something of a mandatory acquisition for avid Schubertians (of which I count myself one).  Overall, you won't be disappointed.  As for newcomers to this repertoire, I might suggest purchasing a complete or partial survey of Schubert's sonatas first (those by Kempff, Uchida, Brendel, and Lupu are particularly recommendable) plus single-CD editions of the Impromptus, Moments Musicaux and Wanderer-Fantasie (if the Sonata box in question doesn't include  these works).  Since many seasoned collectors will already have multiple editions of Schubert's best-known piano works, whatever drawbacks one may discern in Dalberto's survey will not be sufficient to deter one from investing in his complete survey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOXBXVX84IR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BAUD4I#wasThisHelpful","R1NOXBXVX84IR0","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would like to add yet one more voice to the chorus of praise for Levine's (regrettably incomplete) Mahler cycle.  I have known and loved these recordings since they were first issued in the 1970's and early '80's.  I have heard a huge number of Mahler recordings over the years--since he is one of my favorite composers and one whose music reveals so many different facets in diverse interpretations--and I can confidently say that Levine's interpretations of  5, 6, 7 and 9 remain unsurpassed.  If I prefer Horenstein in 1 and 3,  Walter (not his commercial recording) in 4, and Ormandy in 10, that is only by the slimmest of margins. In any case, great Mahler interpreters are not in competition, they are in truth complementary; and for that reason, as an avid collector I could never be satisfied with a single rendition of a given symphony--even if it be among the very finest available, as is the case with Levine's outstanding Mahler cycle. What is distinctive about Levine's approach to Mahler is its cogency and balance. The sheer beauty of the music (that is, where Mahler is not being deliberately ugly or minatory) gets its full due, while the harrowing qualities, the biting irony, and the  toughness of Mahler's style fully registers (as it frequently doesn't in more anodyne interpretations such as those by Maazel, Bertini, Karajan, and on occasion Walter, Rattle, Chailly, and Abbado).  I would also call prospective listeners' attention to the fact that this was the first (projected) Mahler cycle to include a realization of the Tenth (the familiar Cooke revised version), and its presence is some compensation for omission of 2 and 8.The best news perhaps is that the magnificent playing and distinctive sonorities of the three orchestras represented here (Philadelphia, Chicago, LSO) have rarely if ever been captured in more vivid, yet warm, recorded sound.  I haven't heard previous digital remasterings, but I can attest that these are state-of-the art: virtually no digital glare or thinning-out of timbres, maximal impact (the trombone solo in the first movement of 3 will lift you out of your seat), and natural balance.  The sonic image is somewhat distanced, so as to give the illusion of being seated maybe two-thirds of the way toward the back of an acoustically live concert hall; yet there is no want of focus or impact.  I did notice some confusion of channels in this remastering of the Ninth--not exactly a left-right switch, but sometimes it's hard to tell where various orchestral groups (the first violins particularly) are positioned on the soundstage.The only real downside is that, given its rock-bottom bargain status, the presentation is very spartan indeed:  Discs are housed in space-saving cardboard folders (not too flimsy), with track listings and minimal data about performances listed on the back of each.  No notes, texts or translations, or links to a website where such might be obtained.  Moreover, several symphonies are split between discs.  No matter.  This is in truth a mandatory acquisition for all Mahlerites, and a plausible ""basic library edition"" for the works included.  For those symphonies Levine never got around to record commercially for this series (was expense an issue?) I would recommend the superbly remastered Solti/LSO for the ""Resurrection"" and Solti/Chicago for no. 8.  Both are available in relatively inexpensive single-disc reissues from Decca/Universal, with copious notes and texts included, and both are stunning performances.  For those allergic to Solti, I would also recommend Klemperer/Philharmonia for no. 2 (another single-disc issue) and Horenstein/BBC (a glorious live performance in decent broadcast sound) for no. 8. In this way,  could assemble an optimal ""starter collection"" of Mahler symphonies.  Counting *Das Lied von der Erde* as a part of Mahler's Symphonic canon (as the composer initially did), first-time collectors will need to obtain a version of that masterpiece as well.  There are many fine recordings of it, though I would particularly recommend Walter/Decca (with Ferrier and Patzak), and Bernstein/Decca (with King and Fischer-Dieskau, employing Malher's alternate version for Baritone rather than Mezzo/Contralto. Your game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8DCKZNTH6ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041LXX2G#wasThisHelpful","R2X8DCKZNTH6ZC","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Australian Eloquence has already reissued Ansermet's superb set of the *Paris Symphonies"", which could well stand as a basic library recommendation for those works.  Here we have an essential supplement to that set, which admirers of the composer and conductor should also consider.  Along with its neighbor in E-flat (no. 91), Haydn's Symphony no. 90 in C is one of his most neglected masterpieces.  It is a delightful work--celebratory, inventive, and full of sparkling good humor.  It is given a first-rate performance here.  Ansermet draws crisp and well-detailed playing from his Swiss ensemble, as he does in the much earlier E-flat Symphony nicknamed ""Philosopher"" (no. 22).  That work has always been among the more popular of the master's early symphonies, given its distinctive scoring (spice with pungent cor anglais solos) and serious demeanor (hence the sobriquet).  Ansermet keeps the solemn measures of the opening movement from dragging and throughout shapes the music with evident affection.  A lovely rendition.  I wish I could say the same for the two trumpet concertos with which these fine Haydn performances are coupled--or maybe I should say saddled--but the poorly balanced monaural recording, which sounds as if the microphone had been placed in the bell of the instrument, falls harshly on the ear.  Nor is the trumpet playing particularly nimble or elegant--as it has to be in both works.  The Hummel generally comes off better than the Haydn--the sound being slightly more tolerable, and the soloist's phrasing more supple.  The Haydn, however, is a disaster.  I applaud the systematic reissue of the entire Ansermet discography by Australian Eloquence, though in the case of these trumpet concerto recordings one might have wished that they had been allowed to remain in limbo.For the sake of the two Haydn Symphonies, however, this reissue is an essential acquisition for both Ansermet enthusiasts and Haydn aficionados. Thankfully, the engineers have provided vivid and well-balanced sound for these works.  Minus one star, then, for the inclusion of the inelegantly performed and poorly recorded trumpet concertos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJ5VEZMNG25L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027GWJEA#wasThisHelpful","R3CJ5VEZMNG25L","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers as to the merits of Ansermet's Haydn.  Many years ago, when I was first exploring Haydn's symphonic output, Ansermet's trenchant and serious-minded interpretations of the *Paris* symphonies served to dispel the myth of a senile benevolence commonly referred to as ""Papa Haydn.""  There is nothing remotely quaint about this rustic ""Bear"" or frothily galant about this stately ""Queen.""  Ansermet's Hen may not cluck and peck as daintily as some--she's more interested in mocking the *Sturm und Drang* preoccupations of yesteryear.  Finest of all, perhaps is the great and underappreciated E-flat symphony, which aspires to a nobility and gravitas that anticipates Beethoven. Indeed, I find Ansermet's big-boned, but never flabby, approach to Haydn serves as a welcome reminder that Beethoven knew and admired his mentor's symphonic works for their humanitarian values as much as for their quicksilver wit.  Those values come to the fore with Ansermet as they rarely have with other conductors (Bernstein always excepted).  The SRO, often maligned, responds with crisp ensemble and (mostly) reliable intonation, even if the wind-players' phrasing is occasionally on the stiff side.  The remastered  recording sounds as fresh and wholesome as the performances.  Nothing artificial here--either sonically or musically.  Strongly recommended, especially at bargain price, though not in preference to Bernstein whose stunningly athletic *Paris* cycle conveys a remarkable affinity with the composer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY281WW5RSZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027GWJEU#wasThisHelpful","R2JY281WW5RSZE","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am pleased that Newton Classics has reissued Marriner's superb set of the Schubert Symphonies.  This is the only Schubert cycle to include Brian Newbould's fascinating 'realizations"" of the works and movements Schubert--for whatever reason--left incomplete.  So not only does Marriner offer us a finished Unfinished, but several large-scale works, including a vast, Brucknerian Symphony in E (notionally completed from a single line of score) and the altogether remarkable ""Symphony no. 10"" (realized from fairly complete sketches) whose pathos-laden slow movement anticipates Mahler and whose concluding movement boldly and whimsically combines elements of Scherzo and fugal Finale.Whatever versions of the standard Schubert symphonies you may own, if you are an avid Schubertian you must hear this set for these extra-canonical works.  However, this set would be recommendable even if it didn't include Newbould's speculative reconstructions, for Marriner and the Academy give us light-textured, fleet-footed and often ravishingly lyrical performances. Marriner avoids weighing down the early symphonies (1-4) with excess teutonic baggage (as Böhm can sometimes do, despite my abiding affection for his classic Schubert cycle).  In the transitional works (5, 6 plus a couple of Neubold ""realizations""), Marriner charms the ear with playfully sprung rhythms and delicate pointing of texture.  The ""Unfinished"" and ""Great C-Major"" may not have the stature under Marriner they achieve with Furtwängler, Böhm, Walter, Krips and other past masters, but few listeners are likely to complain of insufficient scale, dramatic impetus or structural integrity.  Finest of all are Marriner's deeply considered and thoroughly enlivening accounts of the two grandest among the reconstructed works (the ""Tenth"" and the E-major).  As always the Academy of St.-Martin-in-the-Fields, here enhanced with additional players, provide impeccable ensemble, intelligent phrasing, transparent textures and incisive attack.As with the other reviewer, I have auditioned this set only in its previous incarnation for the Phillips label.  Presumably, Newton Classics has taken over their digital recordings without remastering; if so, the prospective listener can be assured of well-focused naturally balanced sound, with a pleasing ambient warmth (and only occasional glimpses of early-digital glare).  Strongly recommended, then, either as a basic library edition or as a supplement to whatever Schubert symphony recordings you may already own.And while you're at it, give consideration to purchasing Brian Newbould's outstanding critical biography, *Schubert:  The Music and the Man*, in which he gives thorough consideration to the composer's fragments and sketches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PM1F3MI0BVUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AB2FCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PM1F3MI0BVUN","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the first, second and fourth movements, Solti's account is simply the most exciting I have ever heard.  Barbirolli and Horenstein carry greater tragic weight, particularly in I and IV, and Bernstein is epic and angst-laden in both of his outstanding versions (CBS and DG).  But Solti's relentless dynamism goes with exceptional clarity of texture and (thanks to the collective efforts of the CSO) unmatched brilliance of execution. Here is a rare treat--a recording of Mahler's Sixth that allows you to hear literally everything in this magnificent, multi-layered score, yet without losing the structural forest for the incidental trees.So far so good.  However, in that sublime, wistful, yearning slow movement, Solti's extroverted manner is less appropriate. In this movement, I crave more tenderness, compassion, and *sehnsucht* than he provides--though once again CSO provides impeccably precise playing.  Nor does Solti stint on passion; but the mood of this sublime Andante is more delicately contemplative than (as Solti would have it) searingly intense.The digitally remastered recording is as overwhelmingly vivid as the performance.  Altogether one of Solti's best Mahler ventures with the CSO, misgivings about the Andante notwithstanding.  If you are in the market for a ""basic library edition""t his could be it, though I would also consider either of Bernstein's versions, Karajan (superbly shaped and gorgeously played), or Barbirolli/EMI (slow to the point of ponderousness in the opening movement, but deeply considered).  Historically-minded listeners interested in obtaining an absolutely shattering live performance of the work--one that outdoes even Solti for intensity, and easily oustrips him for cogency--should search out the Dmitri Mitropoulos volume in EMI's ""Great Conductors of the Twentieth Century"" series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJW8UJTRMRFTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000025OPA#wasThisHelpful","RJW8UJTRMRFTW","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One doesn't ordinarily connect the names of Georg Solti and J. S. Bach; the late conductor is best known for his ""blockbuster"" recordings of such late romantics as  Wagner, Mahler, and Richard Strauss.  But late in his career he came to record some very fine versions of standard Eighteenth century repertoire, including this St. Matthew Passion.If one expected something overly monumental or grandiose from these forces, then the prospective listener is in for a pleasant surprise.  This is a relatively intimate, scaled-down approach to Bach's great sacred drama that owes much to period performance practice (as understood by a nonspecialist conductor and an all-purpose symphony orchestra and chorus).  Textures are lean, contrapuntal interplay admirably clear, rhythmic cells cleanly articulated and neatly sprung, organ continuo modestly registered, and ornamentation judiciously applied and correctly rendered.  Modern instruments are, of course, employed; but all the obbligato playing (beyond being brilliantly executed--these are the winds and strings of the Chicago Symphony!) displays a more than rudimentary understanding of authentic Baroque style.  Margaret Hillis's superb Chicago Symphony Chorus sings with appropriate fervor; but the tone is always transparent and nicely focused, and vibrato, while evident, is not overbearing.As for the soloists, Solti has lined up a stellar cast indeed: Blochwitz and Bär are among the most convincing exponents of their respective roles (Evangelist and Christus) since Pears and Fischer-Dieskau for Klemperer or Pears and Prey for Münchinger.  They do not quite match Scherchen's Cuénod and Rehfuss in eloquence, but then, who has since that epoch-making recording of 1953 (recently restored to circulation by Tahra)?  Blochwitz is occasionally strained in the upper register, but manages to employ his distinctively reedy (but not too nasal) timbre to intensely dramatic effect in the narration. As Christus, Bär avoids anything like the stentorian delivery one comes to dread in many ""traditional"" versions of this work (cf. Franz Kelch in the old Werner recording).  The aria soloists are all outstanding.  Dame Kiri strays the farthest, perhaps, from idiomatic Bach singing, verging on sentimentality at times, but it *is* a gorgeous voice and that, in my book, covers a multitude of stylistic sins.  Von Otter, on the other hand, arguably veers too close to emotional detachment in her delivery of the alto arias (when compared, say, to Janet Baker for Richter/1980 or Ludwig for Klemperer), but once again, the glorious voice carries the day.  The late Anthony Rolfe Johnson demonstrates that he can sing the tenor arias as mellifluously and intelligently as he can render the Evangelist's narration (his Evangelist remains one of the great assets of the Gardiner version).  Finally, I have nothing but praise for the veteran Tom Krause, whose deep understanding of the bass arias goes with an agility that belies his age at the time of this recording--though his tone does tend to fray around the edges from time to time.  All things considered, this is as distinguished a lineup of soloists as one can hope to find in a non-specialist recording of the *St Matthew.*And what of Solti's interpretation?  ""Dedicated, clear-headed, and vigorous"" are the adjectives that spring immediately to mind.  He evidently loves the piece enormously--but not ""to death"" (hence, dedication); he means to avoid any hint of the ""Victorian"" oratorio-society tradition in pursuing a more stylistically aware approach (hence, ""clear-headed""); and his manner is appropriately intense, favoring upbeat tempos, yet without hyping the drama (hence, ""vigorous"").The sonics are consistently pleasing and effective: wide-ranging yet well focused, if a bit dry.  Voices and obbligato instruments are nicely balanced, and the chorus never sounds mushy or indistinct.The bad news is that this superb *St Matthew*--one of the very best of the modern-instrument versions--remains out of circulation.  Used copies are available, but tend to be expensive.  Decca/Universal should really consider reissuing this recording (one of the gems of its back catalog) at mid-price, ideally as one of ""the Originals.""  Apart from that consideration, this *St Matthew* receives my strongest endorsement--even if it doesn't entirely displace Scherchen, Klemperer, or Richter II in my affections.  Those favoring historically-informed performance practice might well consider Solti as a supplement to Gardiner, Herreweghe, Suzuki et. al., insofar as he manages to combine the best of the ""traditional"" approach with a good understanding of period sensibilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSKQ8R6GBCQ9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041TO#wasThisHelpful","RSKQ8R6GBCQ9W","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Léopold Simoneau and Pierrette Alarie were undoubtedly vocal music's most accomplished and long-lasting husband-and-wife team.  Though they pursued independent careers, they are best remembered for their collaborations on stage and disc.  Simoneau had one of the most effortlessly beautiful lyric-tenor voices in recorded history; ideally suited to Mozart and French repertoire (opera and mélodie), though he also sung some of the usual 19th Century bel canto roles.  Alarie's light, crystal-clear lyric soprano is just as enchanting (mostly in the same repertoire); her upper tessitura was remarkably true--clear as a bell all the way into the stratosphere.I first encountered this eminently loveable pair in their 1959 recording of Handel's *Messiah* under Hermann Scherchen.  Thereafter I have snapped up whatever recording I could find, including DG's splendid  Original Masters collection (issued not long before Simoneau's death)--seven CD's worth of unmached vocal splendor.However, most of the recordings included in this recent Doremi anthology were unfamiliar to me.  I couldn't resist purchasing it, on that account and also on account of its recycling a complete recording of Bach's B-Minor Mass that I owned during my college years, and which I remember with great fondness  (it was briefly available on a Vanguard Everyman reissue, though originally recorded, I believe, on the Concert Hall label).  In any case, these incentives were enough to prompt purchase. I am glad that I did, though I'm not entirely satisfied with the sound: occasional bouts of distortion, peaking, irksome background noise from well-worn LP's, etc.  Despite that caveat, I enjoyed this anthology thoroughly.  The Mozart arias and songs are superbly done by both singers; it's particularly valuable to have Alarie's spectacular renditions of Constanze's arias from *Entführung* as well as some tremendously demanding concert arias. Another delight is a selection of duets by Schumann on the joys and sorrows of romantic love (mostly strophic in form; accompanied by piano).  The B-Minor Mass recording is by no means a world-beater, but it is persuasively led by Walter Goehr (a much underrated conductor) and boasts, in addition to Simoneau and Alarie, a fine quintet of soloists (Rehfuss/Delfosse/Hoffman), as well as a surprisingly light-toned and nimble choir (though they are opaquely recorded).  Goehr chooses some very upbeat tempos and favors an intimate approach to the score that anticipates some aspects of early music performance.  The fourth CD houses two important historical recordings:  the finale of Beethoven's Ninth performed for the 1967 World's Fair in Montreal and Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex conducted by the composer, with narration by Cocteau.  Though neither of these live recordings will be anyone's first choice in this repertoire (the Beethoven has many patches of untidy ensemble, the Stravinsky is dimly recorded), these two occasions undeniably called forth intense involvement from their participants.Altogether this is an important and enjoyable collection of historically significant, even rare, material from two of Canada's greatest singers.  The sound is quite variable, as noted, and there are minimal annotations (no texts or translations), but admirers of Alarie and Simoneau should not hesitate.  Five stars for the two singers; three for sound and production values.  Recommended, then, to specialist collectors.  For others, including those who might want to sample the ""best"" of Simoneau and Alarie, I would strongly urge consideration of DG's ""Original Masters"" anthology of operatic arias, lieder and mélodies taken from DG, Phillips and Westminster recordings of the 1950's.  The sound is considerably better than the Doremi set, and the repertoire covered is more representative of these singers' extraordinary accomplishments (epecially valuable are three CD's worth of French, German and Italian operatic arias and duets--everything from Cimarosa to Puccini, by way of Gounod, Bizet and Massenet--and Simoneau's unsurpassed recital of Duparc songs).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZHAZM075QDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010SAGIM#wasThisHelpful","RIZHAZM075QDZ","A2A55AXWOFFDVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A55AXWOFFDVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Piper is sent off to retrieve an ancient trumpet that is intended to save her mother from a sickness that doesn’t have a name.

Expect the feels.I am always happy when finishing one of McCrimmon's books. She knows how to write the romance and give us a wonderful storyline to enjoy all at once. And this one was no exception. I absolutely adored Preston. He is just as endearing as Finch was in the first 2 books of the series. Only this time it is Katie's turn to get the affection of a good man.If you have been keeping up with the series, you know there is trouble afoot in Haines. And it all points to Katie's daddy. Well, it is going to be Preston's job to come in and clean up the filth that has taken over. And hopefully be able to nab Nate in the crosshairs. The man is a vile person and deserves to be locked away, if only for the way he has treated Katie.Another beautifully written story with an equally beautiful romance…THIS IS WHERE WE BEGIN is a wonderful read. I give it 5 Stars all the way! Pick it up today and immerse yourself in the goodness of this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JH6SA5DZS28J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1SK7ME#wasThisHelpful","R1JH6SA5DZS28J","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If it isn’t one thing, it’s another. Just when Marlow thought his life was going to get back to normal, weird dreams and suicides start happening. And come to find out, Sage is experiencing the same dreams. Will they be able to solve these strange deaths before more lives are at risk…including their own?I absolutely loved book one of the Nursery Rhyme Suspense series. So when I was given the chance to read this one I was on pins and needles until I had a free moment to start it. This really is a series that keeps you on your toes and guessing the entire time. If you are like me your person of interest will be changing a lot.I loved seeing Marlow and Sage again. And even though she doesn't remember who he is, Marlow sure remembers her. His feelings for Sage have grown since he first met her. And if you read book one then you are probably hoping for a love connection between the two. Will it happen? Or will more obstacles get in their way? Read the book! I know you are dying to know!!LIFE IS BUT A DREAM started out really strong for me. It was a great story that kept my attention throughout the book. I have always loved a good detective'ish read. My only fault was with the ending. It ended a little too abrupt for my taste. Buuuut please don't let that sway you from reading and enjoying the story. You may find you like how it ends.4 Who Done It?

"Dahlia has a lot to learn about the clan life now that she has found her mate. Her parents have always dwelled on the fact that clan life is not good. But Dahlia is seeing the good when she is with Tarrow. Until she sees the bad, and it only reinforces what her father has been telling her her whole life. Can she learn to love the clan Tarrow is a part of? Or will she convince him to start a new life of their own?When I first read BURDEN I was smacked useless for several days after finishing it. Any book I may have read soon after most likely didn't register for me. I was that much in love with the story. While I did love book 2, HEARTEN, it still didn't give me all the feels like BURDEN did. But then ENGRAVEN happened. This book! This book once again reminded me of all the feels I had for BURDEN.**Breaking away from her lips was sheer torture. I pulled back to see her eyes still closed, her mouth still open the slightest bit, her chin tipped back begging me to explore her neck and beyond.""Breathe, female,"" I teased.**So much of it reminds me of BURDEN but not too much where you feel it is the same book. Tarrow's character mirrors Hawke's in a way that you know he loves his mate wholeheartedly. He only wants her to be happy. And if that means that he must go away or have her break their bond, then so be it. Gotta love a guy who will move heaven and earth to make his mate happy.Then we see that Dahlia is a lot like Echo as she is trying to come to terms with being a part of something that is so foreign to her. She will have to learn to understand this new life and try to live it. It will be a hard road for both.**She took my hand in hers and I gasped at the connection. There wouldn't be a time when my mate didn’t surprise me.**The romance was beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I drank this story in and came out with the same wonderful feels I had with the first book. I love a story that you know will end well-it has to-but you still get the nervous jitters wondering what all they will go through to reach their happily ever after. Felix doesn't ever (EVER) make it easy on her characters. Something will happen but you better believe they are going to have one hell of a romance to tell in the end.So if you want a love story to go along with a fantastic shifter read...these books are it. If you haven't picked them up...get on it!! You will thank me later.

"Fate keeps bringing Collin and Veronica together. And no matter how hard either one fights it, they start to see that you cannot defy fate. Obviously this new relationship is meant to be. Everything about it feels right. But Veronica is bound and determined to put as much distance between herself and Arkansas as she can. She has a past there that she doesn't want catching up to her. So as soon as she has enough cash and a way out of town she is gone. Long gone.I was so happy with this book the entire time I was reading it. I love seeing that spark between these characters even when they cannot. I love seeing their chemistry grow, even when they think they know what’s best. Now, while I didn't connect much with the characters of the first book, I definitely felt more of a connection to Collin and Veronica. Mostly Veronica. She is from a small town in Arkansas after all. Just like me.Berry did another fabulous job, if not better, with this one. I loved the romance, which is always a must with me and any book. And once again, Berry had the growing relationship perfectly paced and just the right amount without it feeling overly saturated. I just loved it. I also adored the relationship that bloomed between Collin and Veronica and was glad that they didn't fight it too much into the story. They are such a cute couple and I gladly rooted for them the whole time.Perfect storyline, adorable characters…that is what I call one heck of a book! Not to mention, I was left with a need to read more from this author. She is one of those you want to gobble up everything she has out. 5 Wonderful Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LO1P9PG8CI3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXY2PDA#wasThisHelpful","R1LO1P9PG8CI3B","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carsen has carried her past with her for many years...locked up tight and hidden in her mind. But when she sees someone that looks an awfully lot like a key player from her past, she is catapulted right back to graduation night. From there on out she is reliving her past and wondering if the choices and decisions she made all those years ago was worth it.What was neat, but also a little confusing for me, was the multiple POVs. I found if I didn't make sure to read whose POV it was at the beginning of the chapter and the date, I would be lost until I went back and looked. Sometimes with multiple POVs you can get lost in the story and not a good lost. But I made it work and did enjoy hearing from those in the story. I liked seeing and hearing what was going on inside these characters heads. It really does help make the story that much more.Sometimes I got a little mad at the characters and how they wouldn’t just speak their minds. Not to mention their emotions were all over the place. But I had to keep my cool and realize that they are just kids. And even though I didn’t connect right at the start with Carsen, I ended up really liking her. And I think I would have made the same choices she did had I been her shoes.COLLIDE was a wonderful story of finding one's way and learning to deal with the repercussions of the choices you make. But then again it is also so much more...and I for one really enjoyed reading it. I am really hoping that the ending is a lead in to another book; because that was one heck of a cliffhanger we get left with. But still, I recommend it. It was a really good, debut read for the author. 4 Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXS3A4HONOP7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DFLPZ4#wasThisHelpful","RXS3A4HONOP7J","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, here is the dealio. I liked this book. A lot. Was I uncomfortable reading about some of Bella's escapades and where her mind kept going constantly? (And I mean CONSTANTLY.) Absolutely. But that is just me. I am sure others out there-the extroverts of the world- would be ok. I, however, am a wallflower when it comes to sex and even talking about it these days. But I continued on reading this book and so glad I did.Bella goes through hell not far into the story. A hell she has never known. Always up for anything with anyone, she comes face to face with a predator she has yet to encounter until now. This threat will jeopardize everything, including these new feelings for Rafe. Not to mention the disgust and doubts she feels about herself. It really takes in toll on her. But seeing her battle through her hardest year yet at Harkness made this story real and believable and had me rooting for Bella that much more.And let me not forget Rafe. He is so amazing and sweet and funny and caring. Who would have thought that these two would make a great pair? I didn't. I know Rafe is an absolute catch, but together you probably wouldn’t imagine them as a couple. But in the end, I couldn't get enough of these two. Another couple that has me smitten as a kitten. Love them!Seeing Bella overcome all she does and get her sweet revenge made this book a wonderful read. Seeing Bella get the guy that she eventually falls for made it even better.

"Aly is finally graduating high school and can officially begin her life with Jake in New York in their own place. Doubts still plague them both, but they believe that love will be enough to get them through anything. That is until they don't believe it anymore. Truth of the matter is...life is unfair. No matter the struggles they both have overcame in the past...the future will throw more in their way. It is all in how they will handle those obstacles...If you are expecting a fairy tale...move along. This book is so far removed from the fairy tales Jake and Aly once believed in. Real life is not beautiful all the time. And once the problems start mounting, we see the real Jake and Aly. Sometimes it will be hard to handle.There were times I wasn't happy with these characters. But it made me love them and the book that much more. I understand people change and need to experience things. I understand that they are no longer the teenagers we first met. So I was able to grasp that they are not going to be the pushovers they were back then either. I had to deal with the grown up (or growing up) version they have turned in to. Like I said, made me love them more. And appreciate them more. Still doesn't mean I have to like their choices.Such a great ending. I cannot wait to see what comes next for these kids. Don't expect all the answers when this book closes. But do expect a need and a want for the next book in the series.

"You may remember Blonde Katie (Scarlet's roommate) and Andy (Bridger's neighbor) from the last book, THE YEAR WE HID AWAY. But if you have yet to read the first 2 books, no fear! This little gem doesn't really give anything away or spoil anything for you if you haven't. But I wholeheartedly recommend all the books that are out in this series.Anyhooo, I inhaled this little morsel of goodness in just a short period of time. And loved every second of it. I adored the romance that started building, albeit rather slowly at first, only to burst near the end. It was so sweet and hot at the same time. I think Andy was my favorite in this one. Only because he was a nervous wreck wanting everything to be so perfect for Katie. It was too adorable!This author does another amazing job at giving us a read that keeps us glued to the pages and the need to finish and find out what happens with these fun loving characters. One of the best things about this novella is that it didn’t feel like one. It didn’t seemed rushed or missing something crucial like some do. It was actually very well written and I don’t think she could have done it any better than how it turned out. I would, however, love to see more of Katie and Andy in some future books. Only because they were just so darn cute. And with that little part at the end, makes me wonder if the author has something in mind for Dash. Hmmmm?Well there you have it...my review that almost wasn't. (Pregnancy brain had me delete the book when I first got it. So I had to go groveling back to the author for another copy.)

"Paisley is making a list and is bound and determined to get through it before life and her heart consumes her. Well on her way, she is content with what is left of her life until Jagger saves her. Literally saves her. Now she doesn't know what to do with these new feelings and thoughts. Continue on as before or live life to the fullest? Only time will tell. Sweet, precious, dwindling time.Wow oh wow! Another fabulous, page-turner of a book by the incredible Rebecca Yarros. I was once again blown away. I resigned myself to believe that this lady could not pull off another book as amazing as FULL MEASURES. Obviously it had to be a one-time thing right? Wrong. I was completely and utterly blown away with EYES TURNED SKYWARD. I inhaled it until I got towards the end and had to truly make myself slow down and savor the ending that was coming.I loved seeing old characters like Josh and Ember make appearances, but was glad that the story didn't focus on them. So if you are just picking up this author, there is no fear that book one, FULL MEASURES, will be ruined for you. Nothing really gets disclosed that would have you thinking ""Why didn't I read that one first?"" But I would highly recommend that book as well if you haven't read it. It tore me up from the beginning and had me on an emotional roller coaster.But anyhow, loved Jagger and Paisley so very much in this story of theirs. There were times I wasn't sure I could trust Jagger and his feelings, but this nagging feeling I had in the back of my mind told me it would all work out in the end with him. That there was more to him than what we were getting and seeing. And even with all that goes on between Paisley and Jagger from the beginning, I rooted for them to be together and make it. To be that couple that everything works out for them in the end.I loved the plot and all the hidden gems of surprises that awaited us readers. I never saw them coming. It was just a wonderful read and so very glad I was able to partake in its awesomeness! Definitely a must read! I would suggest it to any and all who love an emotional NA read that revolves around military life. Cannot wait for more from this author.

"goodreads...When EmLynn’s dad loses his battle with cancer, the last thing she wants is to move across the country to live with her Mom. Her mom left her dad years ago to start a new, improved family with her new, improved husband.When Eric finds himself in the middle of a mess of someone else’s making, the last thing he wants is to be dumped into the foster care system. He’s spent most of his life on his own, so he doesn't see the point of having a pretend family now.A chance meeting leaves them both thinking that maybe their new town of Roseville isn’t so bad. But as they grow closer, a mutual enemy, along with a tangle of secrets and a web of little white lies, may just be enough to make their new found love unravel completely.My take...I have always enjoyed the books I've read by Hope. AFTER I FALL is no different. It starts out with us getting to know EmLynn and her past. And then there is the little bit we learn of Eric and his. He is more closed up about his past and EmLynn is fine with that. She enjoys her time with him and has no reason not to trust him. Until she can't. Life shows up front and center and EmLynn is forced to face the facts. Maybe she doesn't know him at all. Maybe it is time to close that door and move on.While I loved this story...it wasn't the emotional roller coaster I have been on before with Hope's other books. And truthfully, it was exactly what I needed right now. I didn't need a book that would give me an emotional beating or have me in a fit of tears. I needed a book exactly like this one that would have be happy and content in all the right places or would have me feeling some feels at just the perfect time. And it did. I couldn't have asked for a sweeter, more fantastic read.I adored these characters. Hope gave us some genuine characters that readers could relate to. That is one thing I love about this author. She takes some of her characters and gives them a background that a lot of readers could relate to and doesn't sugarcoat them. Because in real life, teenagers don't lead sugarcoated lives, do they?AFTER I FALL was a wonderful read I blew through. I loved the plot, the characters and especially the sweet romance. As always, I would suggest anything this author writes. 5 Read This Book Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKZIPC6EZAEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGZDM44#wasThisHelpful","R3KKZIPC6EZAEH","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And I for one am glad to see that not a lot has happened since we last left off with them 6 months ago. I am glad that it has been boring for them and no problems what so ever have plagued their lives. Life is just perfect!Oh heck! Who am I kidding? Once you get started reading you will most definitely see that a whole lot has gone down since we last heard from Reagan and her crew. My heart goes out to them as they struggle with new responsibilities and threats against them...all with limited resources. Their journey is going to be a rough one but I have faith in them and Higginson that they will make it through to the end.So that is pretty much all you are getting out of me on this review.

"My oh my!! I do declare this book was a lot scarier than the first one. ( Like my Savannah accent? Just getting into the scene. ) And who waits until night time to read it? This chick. Probably not my smartest move. Because this book coupled with those already weird pregnancy dreams just means a cluster of nightmarish, weird dreams. But I wouldn't take it back. Oh no. Too much goodness and scary ghosts that had me hooked once again.Even though Stacey got on my nerves a wee bit in the first book, I found myself really liking her in this one. I think the last adventure really hit home for her and she had matured some. She is still her same quirky self, just more grown up. And there was a few other characters in this one that were fun to read and had me worried about their outcome.But how Ellie can continue on in this job is beyond me. I would have ran, screaming like the little girl I am at the first sign of some demented ghost. But not her. She kept going and going, and pushing and pushing. She sure takes quite the licking in this one and I wouldn't blame her in the least if she hung up her hat for good. Yep, I love this girl so much.If ghosts are your thing, I highly recommend this read. I inhaled it to the very end and still craved more.

"When we last left off with Greylan he had found himself in a whole mess of trouble. As the book starts, things haven't gotten much better. His career is in the crapper thanks to his unwilling participation with the mob in Vegas, his love life is nonexistent, and the future looks bleak. What has he gotten himself into? Or better yet...what has Meyer gotten Grey into?In NO FEAR Allen gives us readers an intense look at the dark side of Vegas and fighting. Greylan has a lot to deal with and it is not pretty. And Meyer is not helping matters by being cryptic and flighty. On top of all that, he has to try and protect his sister from seeing the sinister side of his career. The stress builds and builds until he feels like he is going to explode.I was none too pleased with Mollie in the last book, but I gotta say I am happy with where the romance went in this one. I won't say with who...but I think readers will definitely be happy for Gray in the end.Fabulous read that once I got reading I couldn't put it down.

"She was heaven and I was headed for the darkest pits of hell. If this was my only chance for bliss I was going to savor it before the angels kicked me out.The fall was going to hurt and I was going to make sure it was worth it.***Get ready for another round of rambling by yours truly. When I love a book so much, I tend to do that. I mentioned last year in my end of the year book survey that THE ACCIDENTAL ASSASSIN was one book I was looking forward to most this year. It should have been out sooner, but life got in the way for Chase, pushing back its release. Hey it happens. But that saying, ""Good things come to those who wait"", has never been truer. I gotta tell you, it was soooo worth the wait. Wouldn't you rather a book be done right, then pushed out the door without a second thought? Yeah me too! So. Worth. The. Wait.I think one of the things I loved most about this book was the characters. Especially Owen. I think it was his transformation throughout. Well, I really cannot say that, because how he ended up in the end was not far from where he started out. He really didn't change...it was more his true self just came out. I loved that about him. He wasn't one of those cocky, arrogant guys that drives you nuts because they keep pushing the girl away. Nope, he actually would embrace his feelings for Ava and pull her closer. *Swoon*Ava was a fun, adorable character as well. She is all sweet and innocent looking, but with the mouth of a sailor. I absolutely loved her. She kept the hilarious dialogue going at times, which I thought fit perfectly into the story. Those scenes were just right to break up the heavy that tried to creep its way in.The story itself was what had me hooked from the beginning. It was like I was in a trance and never wanted to put the book down. I would have happily picked it up every spare moment I had and sadly put it down when I had to be a mom and wife. (Sometimes being a parent is so overrated, am I right?)Could I see more coming from just this one book? Absolutely. Chase seriously needs to think about making this a series if she isn't already. THE ACCIDENTAL ASSASSIN had everything I could ever want in a book: glorious, hilarious, swoon worthy dialogue...lots of action packed,-sit at the edge of your seat,-bite your nails off moments, and unbelievably hot scenes with a sexy, yummy assassin. Yep, being an assassin never sounded so good.So drop whatever it is you have your hands on at the moment...well, at least come Dec 4th, and pick up this book. Read. Devour. Love. New Adult fiction has never been so swoony...or deadly.

"I stood in my bedroom and glanced at myself in the reflection of the long mirror. On first glance, I appeared smaller, but I was stronger. My body had changed, muscles more defined, fewer curves to confuse my clothes. But all I cared about was the strength, and I could see it, especially in my eyes.***I couldn’t wait to get my hands on this book from the moment I finished the first one. Unfortunately life plays a large role on when we get to them, right? And I had to wait a bit of time after it came out to start it. But never the less, I started it and I inhaled it. AlibiZ was such a page turner I found it extremely hard to put down.I mentioned in my review of RecruitZ that I was sad that there wasn't a whole lot of romance within that book. So what I loved about this book was that the romance steadily grew in this one. Rebekah has to learn to let go of the fear of losing those she is close to before she allows herself to live and love again. Can she do it? Will she allow herself the chance to be happy again? Oh the suspense!Another feature of the book that got me was the intense energy running throughout the story. I was at my wits end and found it all so real and believable. Especially when Little Rock was mentioned. YIKES! That had me since I live right outside that city. And I had to tell myself that this was just a story and zombies were not outside my door. (Ha!) Don't you love it when a book gets you feeling it all? But just like the first, this book had me on the edge of my seat and ready for action. Once again, I was blown away by the frenziness coursing through the book.It was great being back in the Afterworld and with some pretty amazing characters once again. The plot, the characters, and the feels were perfection! Bolton did an incredible job on the sequel and I cannot wait for the next! 5 Incredible, Zombie Edible Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNUAQ8YA63K3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXAX5EG#wasThisHelpful","RNUAQ8YA63K3E","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this moment, everything became crystal clear. She was it. I suddenly and passionately knew, with all my being and all of my spirit. Oona said as much...Gra` mo chroi go deo. Ruby was it. The love of my heart forever. My Kansas.***Ever read a story and when all was said and done you thought...""Hey, that author really should write a book in so-and-so's POV""? Yeah. That is exactly what I thought when I read the whole series of Ruby Blue. And I am beyond thankful that Cassar took up that task and gave me what I wanted. Er, I mean us readers what we wanted. So what we get is a whole book in nothing but Brennan's brain. Lord help us all!!!If you haven't read the whole series yet, I suggest you do. Although Cassar does a fantastic job at helping us remember key parts from the series, it is still a good idea to read the series' first so you are well reminded. And trust me, you'll want to read it. Such a fabulous series.Also, I should put this out there. I have read a couple books where an author went back and did the same story in a different POV, and the story either fell flat for me or felt choppy. But not so with FOREVER KANSAS. Oh no. It was right on point and I was loving each and every word.I would be so excited to see more come of this series and these characters. So if Cassar has more up her sleeve, I will be waiting and ready for it. 5 Stars All The Way!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFCWSLY4Z938/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGLPUKO#wasThisHelpful","R3EFCWSLY4Z938","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOST LETTERS AND CHRISTMAS LIGHTS by Elizabeth Hunter review:I've made it clear in recent reviews that there is nothing I enjoy more from a novella, than a holiday novella. I get this fluttering of Christmas spirit when I read one and it could only have the smallest of mention within the story. LOST LETTERS AND CHRISTMAS LIGHTS had me feeling the Christmas love throughout the book! And I must say, I loved being back with Beatrice and Gio. Especially Gio. Oh how I have missed my sweet Gio. But it was great seeing new characters make such an impact and soon become favorites of mine. I adored this quick read to no end. Watching two people fall in love was beyond magical.When you read a book by Hunter you come to expect a sort of poetic writing. A writing that is so beautiful, so real it makes you feel as if you are living in the book itself. And this book was no different. I wish I could explain better what her writing does to me. Beautiful is about the only word that comes to mind when I think about her books. If you have read her works you know what I am talking about.This quick story is a must read! 5 Beautiful, Christmas-y Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30I8H92MUALZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0CJQM0#wasThisHelpful","R30I8H92MUALZ5","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely, positively love novellas based around certain holidays. Especially Christmas. There is always something that makes them so magical and so much fun. And THE HAZARDS OF MISTLETOE was this and more. Ivy took a great plot and had me in love from beginning to end!From the start I was immediately immersed into the story. Even though I have nothing in common with Savannah I felt I knew her and had an instant connection. I liked this girl and wanted good things for her. Unfortunately good things don't necessarily happen to good people. And her Christmas vacation goes from bad to worse...scarring her for freshman year in college. Will Glen be able to right his wrongs the next Christmas with her?THE HAZARDS OF MISTLETOE was such a fantastic book! It was quick to read and had a wonderful, sweet romance. I adored the characters and the feisty dialogue between everyone. I couldn't have asked for a better read, especially for this time of year.

"Get ready for one hot mess of a rambling review. Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. Do I start with the storyline that was ten kinds of messed up but oh so appealing at the same time? Do I start with how the last third of the book was my favorite and had me reading like never before so I could seek out its secrets? Or maybe it was the last few pages that had me weeping uncontrollably. Yeah let’s start with all of that.This book will take you through a roller coaster of emotional turmoil. You will be chomping at the bit to find out what the author is trying to convey. You will be gripping your book and/or reading device DESPARTELY, all just to know what the hell is going on. The storyline is cryptic. The storyline was absolute madness. The storyline was one that will have me waiting on pins and needles for the next installment.I will say that the first two-thirds of the book was a bit...well, not slow, but not action worthy. Until I get to the last third of the book and realize it was. All along it had been and I just failed to see it for what it was. Staring me in the dang face. That last third of the book had me flabbergasted and amazed all at once. The last third of this book had me thinking that Cole is a literary genius and I was just a lowly reader who had finally seen the light! I was floored with what flows through that noggin of hers and spills out on paper. I may be coming off a bit drama'ish...but I am not one for psychological reads. And this one did a number on me. So yeah, I think Cole is a super genius for getting everything out like she did and ending like she did. Did I mention I cannot wait for book 2 yet?The last few pages had me sobbing like I have never sobbed before. Sure if may be the pregnancy hormones that are streaming through me right now. Or maybe it was the relationship that Calla shared with her twin brother, Finn. I have a twin brother and only wished we had a fraction of the relationship they had. But those last few pages, when all is revealed, I cried like I have never cried before with a book. Sobbing! My heart and my soul were hurting beyond normal feelings I have ever felt with a book.I am not sure I can wait until February for VERUM. Everything within me is aching to know. To know what the hell that ending was about...what Calla was going to ask...what the flippity what is going on! I most definitely recommend this read to you and hope you will give it a go. I can almost swear to it that you will love it. 5 Whoa the Whoa-What Just Happened-Give Me More Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QDZ3LBO0MMSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OM34YE4#wasThisHelpful","R1QDZ3LBO0MMSV","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now, while I am usually a big gusher over this series and its predecessor series, I just could not find it in me to love it- love it. But I did enjoy it. Maybe it was the many POVs. 4 total. I do not recall that many before in the series. I understand it was needed at times to get the story across. But also at times it had me confused. (This could be due to my pregnancy brain. Who knows?) Or maybe it was the relationship between Vera and Jared. I just wasn't feeling them. I don't know if it is because I really lost interest in them as a whole...or if I really love Casey and Toby more.Want to know what I loved about the story? I adored Casey and Toby and absolutely loved their scenes together. I felt it really added to the story. They had a lot going on in their lives and I found it extremely interesting to read. Also, as usual, I was also excited to see Levi and Allie again. Can never get enough of Levi. So much love for him.And yes, even though I really wasn't all that intrigued with Vera and Jared, I have a feeling some major, huge, extraordinary things are on the horizon for them in the next book. Trust me, you will get this feeling too when you read the book. I look forward to what will happen next with them.So, if you are reading this review, hopefully you have read the first two books in the series and you are trying to decide if you want to read this one. And while that answer should be a given, because this series is amazing. My answer is most definitely YES! While it wasn't my favorite of the series, I still really liked it. I am still giving it 4 stars. I am still eager to read the next one. So I hope you will pick it up and read it too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHS9ITBFJFRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHZ1530#wasThisHelpful","R1UHS9ITBFJFRY","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy cow! This series is absolutely amazing. You will definitely want to pick it up today if you have yet to start it!Here is snipiets from my reviews of each book...WIDE AWAKE: ""WIDE AWAKE was written perfectly and had me in such an emotional state. Even though I kinda, sorta figured out a part in the storyline, the ramifications I did not. That blew my mind. I was reeling from that moment on until the very end.""WIDE SPACES: ""Emma is the same girl we all knew and loved in WIDE AWAKE and I think I loved her a bit more in this one. Even in the short time since we last saw her, she seems more mature. And rightfully so. The girl is about to marry Mason and live happily ever after. Or will they? Finding out that your soon to be husband feels guilty for loving you? Yeah that kind of puts a damper on the whole love thing.""WIDE OPEN: ""Crap. I don't know if I have read a story by Crane that was so deep and so emotional. This book was definitely one of those that is hard to put down due to the attachment it had on me from the start. This book will be one that so many will be able to relate to. It was one of those powerful reads that make you think about yourself...the way you are living your life. Am what I doing in this life enough? Will I look back and have regrets? Well, that is how I saw it.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16JDOVQIB8F8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAK16PW#wasThisHelpful","R16JDOVQIB8F8Z","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I actually rated this book 4.5 stars. But when leaving reviews at sites such as goodreads, Amazon, etc... I always round up to the next full star.When you start MIDWAY you may recall the first part of the story at the end of THE HARVESTING. It is all so intense as Cricket is realizing this sickness is more than the typical flu strain spreading around the US. And man was it good to be back in Karsak's world of zombies.No fear if you haven't read THE HARVESTING. I think you may enjoy reading this one first anyhow. It is quick and to the point, just a different POV. But I am truly hoping that these two stories will converge into one for the next book in the series. Most assuredly it will. I have no fear Karsak knows what she is doing and plans to give us another fabulous read.The only reason I gave this book a 4.5 star rating instead of a full fledge 5 star rating is because of the ending. I liked it but it just ended. BAM! DONE! I wanted to turn the page and find just a bit more. You may read this and like how it ended. But for me I just needed...more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBFSJEXI71G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OX2KY7U#wasThisHelpful","R2BBFSJEXI71G0","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adored this short, fun read to no end! We get taken back to the LOVE AND DECAY setting but with a few old friends thrown in. Yep, that's right! Not only do we get a bit more Reagan and Hendrix (who are my favorite book couple of all time) but we get some screen time with Kiran and Eden and Ivy and Ryder.Although I have only read book one from the Siren Series, I still enjoyed reading about Ivy and Ryder and didn't feel like I was missing anything. In fact, it makes me want to catch up sooner on that series. I was also reminded of how much I love my love/hate relationship with Kiran. He wasn't as bad as I have remembered him in the past. So in the end it all worked out well for me. ;)I definitely recommend this quick read if you have a few minutes on your hands or in-between books. 5 Zombie/Magic Packed Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5YJ3D30UQTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXHFW4U#wasThisHelpful","R3J5YJ3D30UQTI","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a not so friendly wager goes painstakingly wrong, Candy and Libby must face the dire consequences. While Libby fights for her life in a hospital room, Candy is off to find out who is behind the attack of her best friend. What she finds changes her life forever. Will she be able to save her friend and herself from a most horrible fate? Or will her past show up and prove to be her worst enemy?I must admit I am not used to reading a book by Straight that isn’t para/supernatural of some sort. But her debut contemporary romance was a home run for me. I really enjoyed it and love the suspense it held. Another book I could play detective. I look forward to seeing If this is something she will continue to explore.I adored these characters. It was fun getting to know them before all hell broke loose and during the thick of it. Now all the hell Candy goes through wasn’t fun, but the story had its moments. Not all was doom and gloom. We get a couple great back stories and it just helped the story excel to the end and had me loving it that much more.I was a bit enamored with the romance that showed itself at all the right times. It wasn’t something that was heavily coated throughout the book and that made it perfect. You don’t want a romance that will over power the suspense or the storyline. But in true Straight fashion, we received a book that was perfectly thought out and written.Another favorite read from a favorite author of mine.

"Two young women with two different stories to tell. One of love and one of loss. But together it is one of hope. Hope for things to come and hope for peace…When I first started PEACE & GOODWILL I was wondering how the two POVs would intersect and cross paths. I kept wondering the whole time how these two women would pull the story together. And in the end I was in tears. I honestly didn't see it coming. I was very pleased however with what Strauss had created and the story she had to share.I have been a fan of this series from the start and this book just added to it. Even though the story is a quick one it’s a good one none the less. I happily suggest it to all readers, especially those who need a quick read to tide them over between books. And you can trust me when I say that it is not lacking in the emotions. Oh no! They are there.

"Haven't read this series yet? What are you waiting for? Now is the perfect time to dive into this Rock n' Roll romance. I can promise you will not get enough of these characters! Here is a snippet of my reviews for each book...LOVE EVOLUTION: I adore a good book that gives us a bit of intrigue, even though we know it is going to have a happy ending. Fans of rock-n-roll and romantic comedies will fall for this sweet, page turning read. It kept my interest the whole time and had me wanting to pull my phone out just to read more of it.LOVE REVOLUTION: Michelle really, really knows how to write a book that readers will go ga ga over. I mean look at me. I read this bad boy in less than a day and I am flippin the flip out. Holy tamales it was good. The book flowed super well and not for one iota was I bored. Too much happens in this book for one to lose interest. And that ending? WHOA!LOVE RESOLUTION: Mankin provides everything you would want in a book: romance, drama, tears, heartbreak, love…everything. You want that kick-arse storyline? You got it! You want hot, sexy characters? Oh yeah, they are in here. You want to know what it is like to have your heart ripped out and stomped on?

"*I rated this book 4.5 stars but when leaving a review at sites such as Goodreads, Amazon, etc…I round up to the next highest star!Not too long ago I got CHASING LUCK over on Amazon. I thought I better get a jump on reading it since I would be hosting Berry in an author signing this coming weekend. And let me tell you, from the start I was intrigued and didn't want to put the book down. So I read and I read and I devoured. This storyline had me sucked in; contemplating whether or not the supernatural was crossing over into this suspenseful romantic read. Was it? Read and discover for yourself.Now I say it is a romantic read, but a lot of the romance comes later. Of course there is the internal bickering each of the characters has with themselves. Especially Ace. He is tormented about his feelings for Malerie and the job he is hired to do. But the romance was perfectly paced and I was ready for it when it’s time to shine came up. And I must admit, it was nicely done.Could I relate to the characters? Not really. Both have pasts that affect their present. And it wasn't relatable to me. But I still felt for them, mainly Malerie. So much happens to her in her short life you can't help by feel for her.Really happy I gave this book a go and found a new author that I will happily read her other works. Definitely hope you give CHASING LUCK a chance and check out this unique storyline. 4.5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LC1MZHMGXV7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1RBKTM#wasThisHelpful","R3LC1MZHMGXV7K","A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NV6WTQAZ09ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ted has restarted her life back home in Cambio Springs as the town doctor. She has learned to move on the best she can since her and Alex went their separate ways. Only now he is back. And he says for good. But Ted doesn't believe him. She knows from experience he never sticks around. Only time will tell if he truly means it.This series is one of my all-time favorites. Of course all of Hunter's books are some of my all-time favorites. But this one is all about the shifters. And I must say...Hunter does it right. I've read some shifter books that didn't click with me. But everything about this series clicked right into place. I felt at home surrounded by her characters and her amazing writing. I don't think I will ever get enough of her imagination.I absolutely adored the work up to the romance. It was smoldering. It was fresh. It was oh so hot! Alex is doing everything he can to prove to Ted that he loves her and wants to be in her life forever. Only Ted isn't so gullible these days. She has been hurt by him before and is going to make him prove himself over and over again.Another awesome factor is we see all our old favorites in this one. Caleb and Jena are not going to sit idly by on the sidelines. Oh no! They play huge roles in this book. Then we get Allie a whole bunch too. And it is perfect because her story is going to be next. So pay attention. You will want to know what all is happening in this dusty little town.DESERT BOUND immediately captures the reader and pulls them in...refusing to let them go. At least it was that way for me. I actually took my time with this one for fear of it ending. Because when it ends, it ends. You have to wait a while for the next one. And patience is not one of my better qualities. I do recommend you read FIVE MORNINGS before you dive into this one though. It gives you a bit of a back story for Alex and Ted.

"When I first wrote my review I did so on my nook color on a memo app. I didn't have my laptop on me while on vacation so I jotted down a stellar review (if I must say so) after coming fresh off the book and battling my intense emotions from this freaking amazing read. But when I got home from vaca my nook quickly connected to wifi and ended up deleting my reviews after an update.This book starts off right where LOVE IN THE TIME OF THE DEAD ended. And this time we get two different POVs. We get the take on two people who are probably not ready to see Mitchell or Laney so soon. Two people that have their reasons. But fans of Laney can rest easy though, she has quite a bit screen time in this one still. Something huge happens towards the end that will take the story in a completely different direction. And I was so shocked, yet happy, with how it all went down. In fact, let’s go with blown away. Yeah, that sounds about right.I have got to say I was more thrilled with Sean this time around than I was in the first book. I loved how his character had softened somewhat and how he was soon becoming attracted to Vanessa. And even though she can be a hard person to be around, she was a great character to read about. I enjoyed her sense of humor and understood where she was coming from where Laney was involved. I am not saying I am siding with her, because I ain't. But I understand her from a woman’s perspective. We all like to have somewhere to focus are jealousy on. And I like to think that Laney understood it too. You’ll see as you read the book.If you have read book one, I wholeheartedly suggest you pick up this one and finish out the series. I can almost guarantee you are going to love this one.

"I was extremely excited to get Dizzy's story. He is one of the guys of Tempest that I have always had a soft spot for. And I must tell you that his story did not disappoint. We've seen bits and pieces of him and his past before, but this time we get the real deal. We readers get to experience him like never before. Even with his past and the pain and hurt that he has endured…he is one of those guys I will always think back fondly on. Absolutely adored him.I really, really liked April. And I got to say that I am not a huge fan of cheating but for situations like the one April has found herself in, I am actually ok with it. Once you read you will understand. Her home life is beyond a nightmare and the man that she is married to doesn't deserve her. So yeah, in the end I was ok with her decisions she made throughout the book. She is a sweetheart of a person and truly cares for her loved ones. I hurt when she did, I smiled when she did. I just liked her so much. The perfect girl for our boy Dizzy.Other than that little tidbit of info, (I know some people hate to be surprised there is cheating in a book) I don't want to go much more into the story because I would hate to spoil it for you. Just know I loved it so much and I think you will too. It is very suspenseful towards the end. The kind that has you sitting on the edge of your seat. Mankin has once again written a book that made me feel!

"I could’ve held her like that all night. This whole thing was completely foreign to me. It was like I was in a different world and I’d become a different person around her.I wasn’t sure if I liked him or not.He certainly wasn’t the Crown Sterling I knew.Not that Crown Sterling was much to know.***When an accident on the soccer field lands Crown Sterling in the hospital, he has nowhere left to go but under the care of his uncle in Louisiana. No longer the King of the field, Crown must learn to fend for himself. While he is there recuperating, he meets the stunning, yet mysterious, Lyra. In a few weeks’ time, Lyra shakes up his world and his heart. But will it be enough to change this egotistical jerk into someone that considers other people before himself for once? Or when given the all clear will he take off running back to his old life and old ways?To say that Crown Sterling is a jerk is putting it mildly. Never before has Felix written a guy to this degree. But in a way, you still want to love him. You still know that there is something better hiding under all those layers. It is just the peeling away process you have to endure before you get down deep into Crown's true self. I liked what was found as Lyra stripped away his defenses.Lyra is one of those precious characters that I was immediately fond of. The chick names her dresses for heaven's sake. But it is what she has been through and still dealing with that had me wanting to comfort her. I absolutely love that Felix will take something that a lot of people don't think about and make it a real thing in her books. You actually feel as if she has gone through the hurt and pain that she has her characters experiencing. It is that real.DETHRONING CROWN is one of those books that I have been waiting a long time for. And I will tell you this...it was so worth the wait. I was given bits and pieces of the book over a lengthy amount of time and it was pure torture waiting to see where Felix was going to take certain scenes. To hear her talk about going a different direction had me pins and needles.

"When a young woman is left for dead, she wakes up from a coma that has wiped her memory clean. With no recollection of who she once was or even a name, she is given the chance to start over. To some this would be a small miracle. But to Jane Doe, she would just like some answers to the many questions plaguing her damaged and broken mind. Overtime she hopes that something, a whisper of a memory, anything...will come back to her.I was terribly excited to dive into BURYING WATER. It sounded completely unique and I just had to know what it was all about. When you begin you are transported back and forth between the present and how is started. I wasn't sure I liked this at first. But soon realized I did and it plays a pivotal role in helping the story along. We learn who Jane Doe, who later picks the name Water, was. We see the events that lead up to her should be demise.I wholeheartedly enjoyed these characters of Water and Jesse. No matter the situation I loved them. I wanted them to be happy and find a way. I rooted for them. And even though I know how some things were going to play out, I still held out hope that some parts would magically change for them. That fate would shift its plans for them and rearrange. No such luck. So when the secrets revealed themselves, I held out hope yet again that happily ever after would sneak its way in. Would I be holding my breath for something that could never happen? Just read and see for yourself.BURYING WATER is one of those stories that each time I laid it down I had to immediately pick it right back up so I could just get a few more tiny moments with it again before I crashed for the night. It definitely called to me. It wasn’t real flashy…just a really good book! Did I love this story? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to everyone I know.

"Well, Lily is back and that means me and my daughter, Hanna, have another review for you. She absolutely melted into a pile of doggy love when she was asked her thoughts on the first book. To be asked for her thoughts on this one had her over the moon.Hanna was so happy to be able to see Lily and her friend Sam again. And again, she loved the part of the wagging stub of a tail.

That Hanna was quite as a mouse the whole way through again. One book I understand because it is new. But when you add another book in, and the same results? Yeah, that is awesome. I kid you not that I have to tell her to be quiet with some books...threatening to not finish until she is.

"If you're looking for a good tasty cup of Earl Grey.....this is for you! So many teas these days seem to be made for sissies- you know, how with many of them, you have to kind of ""look for the flavor""? Not so with this excellent-quality Stash tea! I don't like things which are subtle; when I eat or drink something, I want rich flavor in abundance- not something I have to hunt for, and then maybe just get a passing glimpse of.This tea is perfect! You drink it, and you immediately taste the rich hearty black tea base; and the bergamot is full attendance. It's not hanging-out somewhere in the background- it's right there in every sip, from sip one to the end of the cup- AND you can brew a full 8 oz. cup with this (and most other Stash teas) with one tea bag, and still get the rich, full flavors.And yet, the bergamot in this is by no means overpowering. I don't think of this as double bergamot- I think of it as just high-quality Earl Grey, the way it was meant to be; -every other brand I've tried, by comparison (before discovering Stasth products) seemed like weak watered-down nothing.In general, all of the Stash teas I've tried have been excellent (Finally, a tea for MEN! Well, my 90 year-old mother loves their teas, too. They are just in a different realm than most of the weak flavorless teas which one finds in the supermarkets these days)The only BAD thing about Stash teas? Once you start drinking Stash, you'll literally want to throw out all your other brands of tea.

"It's light; it's stiff; It shifts fine! I'm using this crankset with 9-speed Dura Ace on my old Klein, which I needed to convert to a compact crank, because the hills were killing me. Had to play with bottom brackets- as the chainline wasn't right for my bike with the bike's 115mm BB and this crankset- but going top a 110mm BB solved the problem (and this crank does specify a 110mm). For a low-priced crankset, it is outstanding. Even mashing up the hils, out of the saddle, there's no flexing. I was leery, considering the fact that FSA also makes the notorious, hated Gossamer crank....but these Veros seem to have none of those problems. And considering that this baby is even lighter than most of the Shimano cranks....you can't go wrong. There's not a whole lot of options out there these days if you need a compact for square-taper JIS- It was a choice between this, and the Velo Orange....and the Velo Orange was 3 times the price; and I didn't like the looks of it- so I took a chance on this, and it worked-out fine. Seems like a downgrade from the Ultegra crankset the bike came with....but it works just as well- and that's what really matters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHIHZRLV0YOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RLG92M#wasThisHelpful","R3GHIHZRLV0YOZ","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never used Cotman paints before; and in the past, I've always used tubes- never pans- but I wanted to give this set a try, so that I'd have a way to do quick sketches and small paintings on the spur of the moment, without having to drag out a bunch of stuff. I was very pleasantly surprised with this little set! The paints are of good quality- unless you are a professional artist painting gallery pieces, you really don't need anything better than Cotman. The little box is so handy, and surprisingly, I get a lot of mileage out of the mixing areas of the open lid (No need to drag out my full-sized pallet to do little 7x8"" pics!).... But what really surprised me, was the little folding brush! I was expecting the little brush to be junk- I mean, C'mon, what kind of brush would you expect them to include in a $16 paint set? And I figured that it's so small, it would be useless for anything but tiny details- as I always paint with large brushes. But I gave the li'l fellow a try, and was amazed! For such a tiny brush, it holds a decent amount of paint, and can cover a good-sized area quite effectively and quickly! It even holds a nice sharp point! I like the brush so much, that I am trying to find out exactly what line of W&N brushes it is from, so that I can get some full-sized bigger ones! I mean, I love my big flats....but I've done entire 7x8"" sketches with nothing but this brush. Amazing!The one change I'd make to this set, is to ditch the Chinese White and Cad Orange Pale (Watercolorists don't use white!) and replace them with Cerulean Blue and a magenta-ish red- which, in the Cotman line, looks like it would be Permanent Rose - and you'll be able to mix just about any color you'll ever need. Also, if you don't want the pans to go flying, a little rubber cement between the bottom of the pans and the box will do the trick- and yet still allow you to easily remove the pans when you want to.I wish I would have gotten a set of these years ago- I'm finding that being to able to just whip it out on the spur of the moment, when I just have some free time (as opposed to having to square away a big block of time for a formal painting session) has really enabled me to paint more, and is really freeing-up my creativity! In this respect, the 16 clams I paid for this set was the best money I ever spent on art supplies!And the beauty of it is, if you're a beginner, looking to try watercolor on the cheap, without having buy a bunch of expensive tube colors and brushes....just get this set, and a small block of watercolor paper (Don't skimp on the paper...it makes ALL the difference!) and that is all you really need to sample the real watercolor experience.Kudos to Winsor & Newton for a truly great product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBTUN7GI8G67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004THXI#wasThisHelpful","R2BBTUN7GI8G67","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back years ago, when my TV was still connected to the outside world, I used to watch the syndicated reruns of Cheers at 11PM, just as something to watch and wind-down by. It was never my favorite show- but it was always watchable; entertaining; and made ya laugh. In recent years, I'd been hearkening back to memories of watching Cheers, and wishing that I had the series on DVD- but alas! In the past, the price of the series on DVD was just too high to justify. Naturally, when I saw this complete series set offered for under 60 bananas on Amazon, I grabbed it- and I'm glad that I did!In my opinion, this show's appeal lies in the fact that it can make you laugh out loud quite often; and just transport you to a different world, apart from the current reality- which is what entertainment is supposed to do; but which most modern forms fail to achieve. And while I often don't like clichéd story arcs- I have to say that with Cheers, the Sam and Diane romantic story arc was very well done, and even keeps ME interested! And the beauty of it is, instead of concentrating on that one arc, the producers wisely just kept it as one aspect of the show, while giving equal weight to the other characters. Well-done!And, much like Three's Company, this is also one of those rare shows which is good right from the very beginning. It hits it's stride right off the bat in episode one; and the characters are already fully developed. A rare feat, successfully pulled off only by the real veterans of good TV comedy!I see some other reviewers complaining about the packaging. Personally, I have no problem with the packaging. It is more than adequate for storage and normal use; the DVDs are easy to access; and my mailman even dropped the box on the ground from his car, while trying to hand it to me while i was on my tractor- and it did it no harm.All in all, I am very glad that this series is now available in it's entirety for such a low price; and that the packaging is not bulky or gawdy, like some shows which come in novelty packaging!If you're looking for good old-fashioned entertainment to just sit and watch and relax to at night; which will take your mind off of reality and make you laugh...this is it! (I don't know what it is- even though in real-life i despise bars, and would never patronize one- there is something very comforting about this show!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBKI9869EL79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGNLZSI#wasThisHelpful","R3FBKI9869EL79","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember watching Three's Company many years ago- and while it wasn't in the same league as All In The Family or The Odd Couple, it was just good light entertainment, which made you laugh and took your mind off of reality- which is exactly what entertainment is supposed to do (And what modern shows fail to do!)It has been a LONG time seen I've seen this show, as I do not have my TV connected to the outside world; I only watch DVDs; and i had been wanting this series for some time- but in the past, the price was too high to justify me purchasing it. Naturally, when I saw the complete series now available in one set for under 60 clams, I was ecstatic, and purchased it right away.I am completely satisfied with this set, for the price. The packaging is adequate, and doesn't take up too much space- and while the packaging and even the DVDs themselves seem to be of minimal quality, I'm sure they will last if treated with reasonable care. Picture and audio quality are good so far (I'm only on the first disc, mind you...).Some are complaing about lack of extras- but personally, I don't care. I'm just glad that the complete series is available in one package for this price. How often does one watch the extras, anyway? In my opinion, the producers did the right thing by making the series available at a price I am willing to pay. I mean, C'mon- this isn't Seinfeld; it's just a semi-slapstick light comedy, with the great Norman Fell as the butt of many sex jokes...and then later, the great Don Knotts. Fun to atch, and one of the best of it's genre...but really, how much can be said?If you enjoyed watching the show in the past, and are lookin for laughs and a break from reality; buy this- it is well worth the reasonable price, and will provide endless laughs. I tend to prefer intelligent humor, but this is one of the few sit-coms which can still make me laugh out loud. And unlike most shows, it is good right from the start!

"I've been a big fan of Celestial Seasoning's Lemon Zinger and Stash's Lemon Ginger for a while, so when I saw Lemon Lift by Bigelow in a store, I figgered[sic] I'd give it a whirl. My first reaction was ""Where's the lemon?"". Well, I really don't taste any lemon at all in this tea, BUT, it does have a wonderful blend of spices which remind me of pumpkin pie spice- as a result of that spice taste, I now buy this tea- not as a replacement for the other lemon teas, but for it's own uniqueness.If you're looking for lemon, this ain't it! But if you like pumpkin pie, give this a try. Also, do note that this has a black tea base- so it is caffeinated. (Lemon Zinger, by contrast, is hibiscus-based, and thus caffeine-free).

"These speakers produce the highest-quality bass that you will ever find anywhere even near this price point, hands down! Tight but full bass which will not disappoint.That being said, while the overall sound is definitely high-quality, it is not audiophile quality- but you were not eriously expecting that for this price, were you? Then again, these were obviously meant to be computer & A/V speakers (Although I use them for bedroom music speakers), so they were engineered to fill that niche, and they EXCEL at that purpose!I'm reviewing them more so from the perspective of music speakers- so plrease bear that in mind.My only real complaint, is that highs and certain mids can be rather recessed. That's it. If they had merely added a tweeter to each satellite, these speakers would be PERFECT. Even so, they still sound great- and the average user who listens to popular music probably wouldn't even notice. And that being said, they STILL sound better over-all than anything you can get anywhere near this price point which will retain powerful and quality bass.A few other niceties:The on/off button; Volume control; and bass level control are on one of the satellite speakers- so you can control everything conveniently and quickly, including the subwoofer. A headphone jack, and a 3.5mm input jack are also located on the same satellite- so you can plug your MP3 Player in easily. There is also a 3.5mm input on the sub, and R & L RCA input jacks on the sub.The actual components are very well-built and of nice quality. Heavy; not cheap and cheesy. And the sub is built sturdily and heavy enough to take the pounding of the bass that it is capable of producing, with no rattles or other annoying noises.The system works well at all volumes, from loud, to barely perceptible- including the sub, which still does it's thing, even at the lowest volume, and maintains the bass in proper proportion, even at very low volume- and thanks to the bass control knob, you can choose to have virtually no bass at all...or overwhelming bass- or anything in-between. You can tailor it just the way you like for your preferences and listening needs.The only slight caveats:The cables which connect the satellites to the sub are about 6' long. If you want to place the speakers further apart (Their placement in the room, and the orientation of the sub can make substantial differences in the sound) you'll have to get extensions. A standard RCA extension cable for the left satellite can be had for 6 bucks, but the special cable needed to extend the right cable (which contains all the controls) is rather expensive- ranging from 25 to 50 clams or more, depending on the length you need. Considering the qualityu of these speakers though, and the price for which you can get them here on Amazon, that doesn't bother me as much as it otherwise might- even if you spend 40 bananas on an extension, these speakers are still a great deal, and will still sound better than anything you can get for the combined price.Only other minor complaint: There are no keyholes or any other attachment points on the satellites for wall mounting. To be fair thopugh, most other systems designed primarily for computer use do not have such features either (Withj my old speakers, I drilled my own- without even taking the speakers apart- and I got lucky, and didn't hit anything inside...but I'm not willing to take that chance with these- so I made little shelves for the satellites, and velcroed them to the shelves!)That's it.Summary: If you're looking for great-sounding speakers for any purpose, with amazing bass, and are not prepared to spend several hundred bucks, get these! Period! Others aren't even close at anywhere near this price.  There's no competition- these are simply the best you can get at this price point- case closed; no regrets!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Y5AG1K5CWR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VAHYTG#wasThisHelpful","R29Y5AG1K5CWR7","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to keep coffee/tea warm on winter bicycle rides- and it does a great job of it. Seems a little expensive for what it is; and considering the fact that to use it for cycling or pretty much any sport, you need to purchase a Klean Kanteen Sport Cap 3.0Sport Cap 3.0 in order to be able to drink directly from it without removing the cap and letting the heat out.... But it's still the most inexpensive and best alternative for keeping drinks warm on a bicycle- as all the other decent double-insulated bottles which fit water-bottle holders, cost substantially more. [Klean Kanteens cost almost as much, but they're only single-wall- not double).It fits nicely in my bottle cage; and is not as heavy as I expected it to be [That's a GOOD thing!]A quality product- no complaints!

"I really wanted to like this mirror- it looks like a good design- but unfortunately, it is implemented poorly. The mirror simply does NOT stay put! It is more dangerous riding with this mirror, than no mirror at all, because you constantly need to re-adjust this mirror- as riding into even a modest wind; going over 15MPH; or even moderately-rough roads will endlessly keep knocking it out of adjustment. I even tried modifying it, by coating the pivot ball and socket weith rubber cement- but it only helped a little. One 34 mile ride with this piece of garbage was enough!The screw that tightens the mounting plug into the end of your handlebar, also controls the friction of the mirror's swivel- but no matter how tightly you crank down that screw (to the point where I was afraid i was going to crack my carbon bars!)...it just does not put enough resistance on that swivel to hold the mirror in place- unless you're only puttering along at 10MPH on a smooth road on a windless day!If they would merely add a small set screw to allow to lock the mirror's pivot in place, it would solve the problem.And while I wasn't expecting the world for ten bucks, I find it ironic, that I ended up finding a great mirror, which I love, for even less than this hunk-O-guano!! If youi want a great mirror for your drop-bar road bike, get this instead:  Pro Road Warrier Bar End MirrorOn the other hand, if you're a hipster, this mirror may be the next big trend! -Not as a safety device; but as a bicycle-fashion accessory! Picture it flapping uselessly in the breeze on a fixie with pink wheels and green tires, as the hipster-rider blows a red light on the way to the IPO-selling cafe in the regentrified neighborhood! Yes, this could be the next hipster trend! Remember where you heard it! In fact, if you already own one of these, instead of throwing it away, you may want to hold onto it, because if CatEye ever fixes the problem, these floppy useless ones will no-doubt be a hot commodity on that big auction website, and once they become scarce, will probably sell for six-hundred bucks, right up there with ancient horn-rimmed glasses and 1970's polyester disco shirts!","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EM5GYIA7TF0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P1Q170#wasThisHelpful","R3EM5GYIA7TF0B","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

By contrast, these Kenyons are actually warmer- much warmer- and less than half the price of the wool.

"I got a newer bike recently, and was stressing over the fact that my beloved Mirrycle STI-mounted mirrors do not fit 2010 and newer brifters; so I decided to try 4 different mirrors, hoping to find one that would be to my liking. The other three mirrors were garbage- but this simple bar-end mirror won the contest! In-fact, I now prefer it to the Mirrycle!*It stays put.(Even at 30+MPH/in the wind/on roughish roads)*It offers a good-sized viewing area (better than other bar-ends)*It couldn't be easier to install (Comes with two different ""plugs"" so will fit different sized bars)*It doesn't protrude out to the side- so it does not get in the way.*It looks good- doesn't ""fred-up"" your nice bike.*It's rather aero.*It offers a quick convenient view whether you're riding on the hoods or in the drops.*It's inexpensive!*Has largest viewing area compared to others of this style- i.e. much bigger than The Italian Mirror; bigger than Sprintech; etc.And surprisingly, I find it easier and quicker and more natural to take a glance at this mirror, than I did with the STI-mounted Mirrycle! You'd think with the STI-mounted Mirrycle, it would be quicker to use, not having to look down as far- especially when riding the hoods- but NO! -this baby is actually more natural to use, as instead of having to turn your gaze down a bit and to the side, with this, all you need do is a quick glance down (You don't have to turn your head at all). In the drops, it's even easier!Also, even though the mirror surface is smaller than the Mirrycle, I find I get a better view, because of the lower position. With this mirror, it's all road view, as opposed to my left arm.I had had reservations about getting this kind of mirror, because I'm blind in one eye, and a real Mr. Magoo with the other- but this mirror is still large enough that even I can get a good view- and if it works for me, it'll definitely work for you!Great product; I'm ordering another one for my older bike- I'm actually going to replace the Mirrycle on that bike with one of these, as I prefer it's view, and unobtrusiveness.UPDATE: Well, that was fast! These things DO BREAK EASILY! I was just fooling around with mine, in the house, and the stem of the mirror snapped-off right at the little ball on which it swivels. I like this mirror so much though, that I drilled-out both the stem and the little swivel-ball, and put put in an eighth-inch metal dowel (cut from a nail with a pair of Vise-Grips...) and JB Welded it all together- she's nice'N sturdy now! I also completely covered the swivel ball in a layer of JB Weld, to give it a little more diameter, so it stays in-position even better in it's socket when mounted on the bike- Now it's really rock solid! They really need to make these beefier though- I don't see them lasting long under normal useage, without the above modification. I'm planning on buying a few more of these, but I'm not even going to wait for the new ones to break- I'll just saw the stem off at the ball and modify them as I described above. Still a good deal though, considering all the other mirrors out there- 90% of which are useless. -And at least they're cheap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WXIRXEYRQ23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C44QAOK#wasThisHelpful","R6WXIRXEYRQ23","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had bought one of the original (just plain) Clips years ago as my first MP3 player, and was pretty impressed by it (except for it's battery performance). I purchased this Clip Zip as a back-up/outdoor player, as I didn't feel it appropriate to use my big expensive Cowon player in those situations (and my Sony which used to do back-up/outdoor duty recently croaked).I was quite disappointed with the Clip Zip. I thought it was supposed to be an ""upgrade"" to the original Clip- and in a few ways it is (such as the MicroSD slot and full-color screen) but in most respects, it not only still fails to correct some of the problems of the original Clip, but is actually a downgrade!For instance: The Al-Gore-Rhythm (algorithm) of the shuffle feature still sucks! (It'll play some tracks over and over, while never playing others) -I mean, SHEESH! All these years since the first Clip, and they can't fix such a simple problem? Battery life is still abysmal (Regardless of what they claim- it's only around 10 hours, under light usage); and while the sound quality is decent (Better than iPod; not as good as Sony or Cowon) it did not seem to me to be as good as the original Clip- although everyone swears that these Zips are built from the exact same hardware....But the worst thing about the Zip, which is a definite downgrade, is the finish/type of plastic used for the actual body of the unit. The original clips were smooth and shiny and solid-feeling. These things feel like some kind of disposable one-use item- like a disposable razor or something; they now feel very cheap and flimsy- not even as good as some $10 Dollar Store player; like a cheap toy.It gets worse! O-K, there was no way I was going to pay full price for a new Zip- as you can buy a Sony for just a few bucks more- so I bought this refurb- as, even considering the flaws of these things, for <30 bananas, it would be O-K for a back-up/outside/lawn-mowing player- even though I didn't expect it to last more than a year (These teeny things with their teeny battery have always had battery issues- they just don't last) but the straw that broke the camel's back, was that this POS would brick EVERY time I disconnected it from my computer, after charging and/or file transfers. It was possible to get it functional again, by doing a ""soft reset""by holding down the power button for a while....but each time, I'd have to hold the button longer and longer- and now, after a few weeks, it is getting to the point where it is almost impossible to get it to boot-up. Even for <30 clams, I expect the stupid thing to last more than a few weeks! Back it goes!It's a shame. Had Sansa truly worked at improving the original Clip just a little, by fixing it's issues, and keeping the price low, this could be a decent second/back-up player- but instead of working on the issues, it seems that they added a few new frills; raised the prices; and lowered the quality- transforming these things from decent ""serious"" players, to something that should be in the Dollar Store for 10 or 15 bucks.NOTE: They say if you Rockbox these things, it can improve performance/fix some of the issues- but of course, doing so will void the warranty- and considering how cheap and flimsy these things feel now, I just don't care....","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DXFS21QCDBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDOCYFI#wasThisHelpful","R16DXFS21QCDBJ","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been in love with the KJV for a good deal of my life- but somehow, it just never seemed right that the most important, most significant, most awesome book ever published in the history of the entire universe, should be reduced to some small volume printed on tissue paper. Enter this Greyden Press 1611 First Edition facsimile!THIS is more like it!It's the perfect size! It's not small, like the average Bible of today...but it's not as large as the original KJV- which would be unwieldy. It's somewhere between those two extremes- about the size of a concordance- and thus, it is just right for daily use. This is not a little book to be held in one hand while reading. Set it on your lap- you know it's there, but it doesn't crush you; or read it at a desk or table.The old Gothic typeface is a sight to behold! It adds beauty and elegance; and sets the Word of God apart from the average modern book. It takes a little getting used to, to read it well- but the font is a decent size (10pt) and clear and dark, so once you get used to the look of the letters, you will have no problem.I find that this  typeface causes me to read more slowly and deliberately...and that is a good thing, as it gives me time to absorb and contemplate what I read; without having to actually stop and ponder. Another added benefit is, that being forced to read more slowly, and not having to stop and ponder, seems to prevent the inevitable tiredness that seems to be quickly induced when I read! It seems that with any other book (even standard KJVs) I just read a few pages, I'm struggling to stay awake/get really tired. Not so with this Bible! I think the posture of keeping it perched on my lap, and the slower reading/no need to stop and contemplate/not being able to sit back and recline while this is on my lap; AND the extra attention necessary to decipher the Gothic typeface, is the key!This Bible really lets you EXPERIENCE the KJV- as opposed to just reading it. (Think of a simulator vs. an appliance). Having such a book which is large and substantial, with real book pages, instead of see-through tissue paper :D ; the beautiful and ""different"" font, and no extraneous BS (i.e. no ""words of Christ in red"" or anything like that) really adds a special atmosphere and reverence which sets the reading of this book apart- as should be the case for the Word of God; and for such a beautifully written and elegant text as the KJV. I feel like I'm in a different world when reading from this Bible; It's like going back in time.Do note that the price of this Bible varies WILDLY. A certain brick & mortar retailer (who sells Kenmore appliances and who used to use Winnie The Pooh as a logo on their clothes) sells this very Bible for over five-hundred bucks! I got mine for under a hundred, via a little internet searching and a large famous ""auction"" site.The only question that remains, is how the binding will hold up. It is a glued (as opposed to sewn) binding- which are generally not the best. It seems to be of good quality- as much so as a glued binding can be- but being a large and heavy book, I don't know how it will hold up. I've only had my Bible a few days as of this writing- but I see nothing to cause me any worry so far- i.e. when you open the book and lay it flat, there is no creasing of the spine or uneven shifting- so that is a good sign. My Young's concordance has a similar binding, and has held up for nearly 30 years.....so we shall see- But for such an awesome book, and considering that it is readily available for under $200 (and under $100 if you poke around), one can't have everything/can't complain.You have to wonder sometimes, with volumes of this nature, if the publisher intended it as a display piece, or as something to actually be read and used. This is now my daily reading Bible, so I will update this review as time goes on- but bottom line: If you love the KJV, and want to aesthetically enhance your Bible reading, buy this book! I like mine so well, and considering the low price one can get them for at the moment, I may just order another one to keep as a spare. I also foresee these appreciating in value as time goes on, as many of the better KJV facsimiles have in the past- as these are not produced in huge numbers- and considering what some places are even selling them for now (as mentioned above)- just get one while you can; while they are still cheap! You can never go back to a small tissue-paper Roman-typeface Bible after having one of these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FHNBEWHD63A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570743894#wasThisHelpful","R28FHNBEWHD63A","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FINALLY- a nice pair of waterproof boots at a reasonable price! Many of the brands I used to buy and rely on, have reduced their quality in the last few years, to the point where I can no longer buy them [Think Timberland; Georgia Boot; Herman Survivors...]- I had never tried Wolverines in the past, but had always wanted to, so I thought I'd give them a shot.I've had these Wolverines for over a month now...and I am very impressed- so much so, that I am going to order a 2nd pair.They seem to wear well, and I think they will be durable (I'm not too hard on boots....but it seems that the finishing on many these days is so thin, that a new pair of boots will be all scuffed/scraped up in a few days- just from normal use- i.e. walking around; kneeling; etc. But these Wolverines are still looking good!They were comfortable from day-one! Required no breaking-in at all.Of course, they look great!The lacing system is fast and easy.The soles offer good traction and comfort, and yet are not the heavily-lugged variety, which trap mud and dirt. These soles stay clean, and are easy to clean when you do get crud on them.Of course, it will require more time to assess the durability of these boots- and whether or not they'll still be waterproof 6 months or a year from now- which seems to be an issue with a lot of other manufacturers these days; and I will update this review periodically- but so far, so good- and from what I've seen, I'm optimistic. I've been wearing workboots since I was a teenager (and I'm middle-aged now) and I can usually tell after a few weeks use if a pair will be durable or not. I have a feeling that these are going to be much like the ones I bought them to replace, which lasted me 10 years!In short: I love these boots! They already seem like old friends...but are still like-new! Hard to believe, for such a reasonable price!DURABILITY UPDATE 11-12-2014O-K, so I've been wearing these boots 90% of the time in the few months I've had them. I've done some building projects; got cement dust on them; am replacing the clutch on my tractor; etc. and you know what? These boots still look great! Unlike my Georgia boots, they haven't gotten all scuffed-up and scraped, even though I haven't been babying them! (The Georgia boots got horribly scuffed/scraped just wearing them a few times to town!)- I just ordered a second pair of these Wolverines to use for ""good""! And they're SO comfortable, in every situation. One caveat: If you climb ladders a lot: These soles can be a little slippery on aluminum ladder rungs- but the soles are great in every other regard- and since I don't climb ladders too often, I can live with that- that be aware, and use extra caution if you should climb a ladder while wearing these (I would imagine the traction on metal roofs wouldn't be the greatest, either...)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2Z8RG6Q3089/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LMDT2M#wasThisHelpful","RJ2Z8RG6Q3089","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a tea-lover since I was a child. It used to be, you could buy a box of Lipton tea in the supermarket, and have perfectly fine tea. I don't know what has happened in recent years, but the major tea brands have all turned to crap. Twinings comes close to reproducing what normal tea once was. It is much more flavorful and rich than Lipton and such is these days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRC9BSNAFE0S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GM60LE#wasThisHelpful","RRC9BSNAFE0S4","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could only sit through about 20 minutes of this tripe! I thought this would be a fun movie; and having gone to high-school in NYC myself, albeit in the 70's, I figured I'd enjoy the nostalgia aspect.  This movie was just so stupid and boring, I couldn't stand it. You don't care about/have any interest in any of the characters.The one positive thing I can say: It does paint an accurate portrait of two aspects of the NYC school system, by illustrating what a babylon of confusion it is; how the staff are more interested in (and forced to) follow petty rules in regard to everything they ever do; and how the atmosphere in the schools is totally not conducive to learning (and it's much worse, today!)- but such things do not make for entertainment,  alone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVMI0JBRF97E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UPMZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R2BVMI0JBRF97E","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My elderly mother has always loved these little transistor radios- but for quite some time, it has been nigh impossible to find any of decent quality. I was really prepared to buy my mother a much more expensive Sangean or something, because we live in BFE (the boonies) and have metal roofs, so reception is tough. But after reading the reviews on this Sony, I couldn't resist giving it a try, before going with something that would cost over $50. My mother was very skeptical when I told her what it cost- she was basically ready to chuck it before it even arrived- but it arrived the other day, and my mother's scorn for it quickly turned into praise- now she wants me to order another one, so she'll have it in the future when this one wears out!I walked into my mother's place the other day while she had the radio on, and I couldn't the sound that this little thing was putting out! It was rich and deep- not tinny at all- and quite loud! Amazing! She had no trouble getting stations were problematic on every other radio.I'm impressed! All the good reviews on this radio are TRUE!

"I had initially given this a good review. I had bought two of these flashlights. At first they were great- I could light-up one of my out-buildings 300' away while standing on my porch! That didn't last long. The brightness quickly faded (Yes, I keep the batteries well-charged). Seems to be a problem in the circuitry in the switch. Both lights do the same thing. Now, these flashlights don't produce as much light as my $2 AA-battery-powered flashlight from Tractor Supply! I can't see worth a darn 10' in front of me, in my yard!Spend the money and buy the real thing, instead of these cheesy, worthless knock-offs.

"For such a cheap flashlight, this seemed pretty good at first- but after only a few uses, the brightness faded to the point where this piece of junk puts out much less light than my $2 AA-battery powered flashlight from TSC. I have two other cheap knock-off ""CREE"" flashlights which did the exact same thing- they worked great at first, but after just a few uses, are as dim as an NBA player on Wheel Of Fortune!This is going into the garbage- it is useless. And yes, I keep the batteries well charged. (At least the batteries that came with my other knock-off CREEs are half-way decent; The batteries that came with this are as worthless as the flashlight- they are significantly lighter than similar batteries- merely smaller batteries inside of a larger 18500 shell!After messing with this crap, I'll gladly spend significantly more for the real thing, so that I'll have a decent flashlight when needed.

"I'm not going to tell you that these are audiophile-quality cans. A real audiophile could tell you (and me) why they are not- but you're seriously not expecting audiophile-quality for fifteen bananas, right? What these are, are cans that sound GREAT, if you like bass. I don't know how they'd do with rap ""music"" or anything like that, but I listen to older stuff- everything from oldies to classical, and these babies give me the sound the way I like it: Warm; rich and bassy. For the kind of music I listen to, the bass is not distorted nor artificial-sounding. The mids and highs are there too. Not as prominent as the bass; not like they would be on a $200 pair of audiophile buds, but these sound GREAT to me (and my EQ is heavily tweaked to emphasize bass- even in music that was never bass-heavy- you may even get better performance with a flat or less heavily tweaked EQ).These are the second-cheapest pair of IEMs I have ever purchased, and yet they are my all-time favorites! They sound better than my JVCs, and they require substantially less volume to achieve the same level of loudness as the JVCs.The foam tips not only achieve a good seal in your ear (which really helps the sound quality), but they are very comfortable [I've always HATED earphones!] AND, the best part is: They don't come off in your ear when you take the phones out! [Unlike those stupid silicone tips, like the ones on my JVCs, which I had to dig out of my ear canal with a toothpick once!].I've read of other users having some problems with durability, which seem to be attributed to the built-in volume control. So, as a precautionary measure, I took a piece of clear packaging tape, and wrapped it around the volume control pod, with the volume slider set at max. I feel that this will stave off any problems, because it will keep the slider from moving [which is likely a point of failure] and, as the tape overhangs the volume pod at each end a little bit, it will act to relieve stress and movement on the wires, where they enter the pod- which is probably another major failure point. Hopefully these will last as long as my old Koss ""Plugs"", which I had for 7 years.I'm no audiophile- but all I know is that I like the sound of these phones better than any I've ever had [and I do use them with high-quality mp3 players- including a Sony E384 and a Cowon X9].  They're just perfect for the music I listen to, and the sound I like. Give them a try- for 15 clams, you'll likely be amazed. In my [biased] opinion, you could spend $100 on some ""good"" cans, and not get the sound that you can get from these!I'm actually going to buy a second pair, just to keep for the future, because I like these so much!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9L0DK3RGC6YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001S0NTMC#wasThisHelpful","R9L0DK3RGC6YG","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first got my first pair of these boots, I thought they were the greatest boots on earth. They were comfortable from day one; looked great; were easy to get on and off, with the zipper; and they were waterproof [""were"" is the operative term, here!]. Who could ask for anything more? I even ordered a second pair, to keep for the future; and then a third pair, when I found a shoe-store's demonstrator pair being sold on that famous auction site for a greatly reduced price. So I actually own 3 pair of these.Well, I should have waited longer to make those extra purchases....because as it turns out, these boots go downhill quickly.The main problems are: They don't stay waterproof for long. And it's not that I don't know how to care for waterproof boots- I've been wearing workboots all of my life, since i was a teenager (and I'm a middle-aged coot, now). At first they are great- I wore them in the snow, and they were dry and warm- and yet they are light enough to wear in the hot summer too- perfect! Perfect, that is, until they are a few months old.... And it doesn't matter if you keep them up with silicone or what-have-you.My middle ""back-up"" pair, which I'd only worn a handful of times, I wore on a walk last night- on mowed paths through my pasture- and they leaked just from the short wet grass!!!!! That is pathetic! So, I can't even think of wearing these boots in the snow now...much less where  I might have to walk through shallow standing water, like puddles or anything! So if you're looking for a waterproof boot...look elsewhere, because these will let you down.I have a pair of Herman Survivors, which cost half as much as these Georgia Boots, and they are ten years oild, and only recently lost their waterproofness (and only because the upper started separating from the sole)Another major problem with these Georgias, is that the leather is of extremely poor quality. The finish is so thin, that these boots get scuffed literally from just walking through the grass. I've been gentle with these boots- wearing them for going to town or taking walks, or just knocking around, because they are comfortable- it's not as if I'm doing logging or steel-work or something- and yet, these boots end up looking like CRAP after literally just a few wearings. They look like they've been through a war...whereas in reality, they've only been through walks and shopping trips to town!  My 10 year-old Herman Survivors look better!It's a shame, because other than for those caveats, they would be great boots. The zipper is sturdy and will out-last the rest of the boot. They fit perfect and don't even need a breaking-in period; They look great [when new]; They don't have lugged soles, so they don't pick up mud; and yet they afford good traction....they could be the perfect boot if not for the above-mentioned major flaws. And I still love to wear them when it's dry; and when I feel like painting them up with that colored shoe ""polish"" [Because otherwise, as a relative once remarked to me ""Your shoes look worse than a homeless guy's""!] -I swear, the finishing on this leather is tissue-paper thin!So here I am, stuck with 3 pair of non-waterproof boots.....which deteriorate faster than even cheap Walmart junk. And don't even THINK of wearing these for traditional workboot applications!I won't be buying any more Georgia Boots- I've learnt my lesson. From now on, I'll go with Herman Survivors- as they're cheaper; stay waterproof forever; and stay nice-looking.*****[EDIT: Forget Herman Survivors. Turns out, Walmart bought-out the Herman patents, and is now manufacturing Hermans as one of their cheap-o junk brands- and they are nothing like the quality that Hermans used to be. I've just ordered a pair of Wolverines here on Amazon...we'll see how they do...]****I do understand why there are so many positive reviews of these Georgias- because for the first few months, you'll think they are the greatest boots ever.  And then you'll even consider trying them again, because they were so good at first -""Maybe you just got a bad pair""..""I just want to experience what it was like the first few times I wore these""- and then you'll end up with 3 pair...and wet feet...and bum's pitying you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1FO3O3KH7OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00068D97M#wasThisHelpful","RX1FO3O3KH7OB","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is with great sadness that I pen this review. I hate to say anything bad about a show which for DECADES now, has provided so much joy; laughter; and entertainment- a lone treasure from the cesspool that is Hollywood.Of course, as with any show, some seasons are naturally better than others- but unfortunately, The Simpsons have hit rock-bottom with this season.Some might say that after so many years, that the crew of people responsible for making this show have finally run out of ideas- but I do not believe that that is the case. Rather (and they even allude to this fact in the commentaries) I believe the problem is that this is one of the years in which they were devoting so much time to the making of the [awful!] Simpsons Movie, that they neglected the actual show. Why they would do such to such a successful show (or why they were allowed to do it!) is beyond me- but such a course of action was disastrous for the show, and I'd wager that it was also a very poor business decision.Problem B: As had been the case in several preceding seasons, the producers seem to have fallen into a routine where they are more concerned with the plot of the episodes; and less concerned about the humor; wit; and amusing parody of/editorial on contemporary culture- which is a shame, because it was those things which once made the show so great.They devote so much effort to ""telling a story"" - and subsequently then have to devote more time to resolving the details of that story- thus relegating the humor and witticisms to a subordinate position. They even admit that oftentimes, due to time constraints, jokes and the little flourishes that once made the show so great, must be cut or passed-over entirely, in order to use the available run-time to tell the story demanded by the plot; and to resolve the details of that story.You would think that amongst such a cadre of intelligent people, as those who produce this show, that they could figure out that people do not watch cartoons for their plots/drama/meaningful stories!!! I'd imagine that I speak for many when I say that I personally watch The Simpsons for: A)The humor; B)The wit [The Simpsons was the ONE show which uniquely stood out as possessing intelligent and witty humor- as opposed to the vapid moronic nonsense which normally emanates from Hollywood] and C: All the little flourishes/observations/parodies which served as a commentary on/lampoon of/ridicule of contemporary American culture.Sadly, all of those great traits mentioned above are now gone. It's as if the producers have stopped seeing themselves as comedians/cartoonists/entertainers, and instead now seem to operate under the modus operandi that they are making half-hour animated dramas- with maybe an occasional joke or two thrown in here and there.Some people disparagingly refer to this season as one of the ""Al Jean years""- which is unfair- as, in my opinion, Al Jean is brilliant, and has played a major role in the long success of the Simpsons- having been a driving force behind the show virtually since it's inception- and should be commended for all the GOOD seasons which he had a major role in producing, in one capacity or another.The Simpsons is clearly a big-team effort...but in this season, the ""team"" was obviously more concerned with making a movie; and relegated the series to a back burner- and it obviously shows. (And they really struck-out on that movie!)It was glaringly evident how they took many ""shortcuts"" with this season: Virtually every episode contains at least one music montage. -Now I can enjoy a well-placed music montage, when it is appropriate and relevant and well-done....but when one starts appearing in every episode, it is evident that it is just being used as a vehicle to fill time while requiring the least input.Also, the great touches which made earlier seasons so great, were noticeably absent here- i.e the little flashbacks/flash-forwards/thought balloons/non-sequiturs; etc. No, instead, we get little animated soap-operas now.I had high hopes for this season, as I read it's description and reviews, because I love it when they explore secondary characters- like Patty and Selma; Skinner; Flanders; etc. and even devote entire episodes to them- which they indeed do in this season- but unfortunately, even that couldn't save this season, as even those episodes were poorly done; and again, were centered around setting up a dramatic plot, and then resolving it- thus pushing out all the other traits which formerly made the show so great.After watching the episodes and commentaries of this season once, I sold my season 16 DVD set. Nothing worth keeping here. I never thought I'd have to do that to a Simpsons DVD set.Kudos for the commentaries on every episode, though. As usual, the commentaries were very enjoyable- only this time, they were much more enjoyable than the actual episodes.Bottom line: If you're looking the wit; humor; and observations/parodies/references that the masses don't ""get""/etc. which once made this show so great...you're not going to find them in this season. :(","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXM104P77NHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4NPBI4#wasThisHelpful","RSXM104P77NHU","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A thoroughly entertaining and informative great documentary about a great man!Myself, being originally from the north, it took me years to come to a true realization of the REAL facts surrounding the South and the Civil War and Lincoln, et al - and occurred only after I cultivated a keen interest in history. I wish I had seen this documentary (or something similar) when I was much younger, as it would have saved me much time, in overcoming the lies which we were fed in the public schools and by the media!Unlike many of the revisionist history books and fairy tales out there, this documentary is more realistic and accurate. It is not just another ""Lincoln freed the slaves...the Civil War was about slavery"" piece of clap-trap, This documentary presents a more honest and factual account of what was indeed happening during the life of Davis.Still, it is not perfect, and is somewhat lacking. It did not really show the cruelty and savageness of the Northern army (and not just to their enemies!); and while it did touch upon the real motivations for the Civil War, it still failed to substantially mention and explore the two major issues of the North's not wanting to lose the illicit taxes they were collecting from the South; and the role that the cotton trade played [The North being reliant upon the South's cotton for their industry]. Although these things may've received a one-sentence mention, they certainly deserved at least equal time with the aspects the show did choose to explain in a little greater depth. Also, the role that the New York bankers and shipping companies played.... But still, overall, this was a more faithful, honest and unbiased account than is generally seen.I find that many historical accounts about the time period of the Civil War are usually biased in favor of the North. It was refreshing to see that this was not the case with this one. Neither is it biased in favor of the South, contrary to what a few other reviewers seem to think. It is an unbiased, factual presentation. And while it may have some omissions, if anything, those omissions serve as damage control to the North. If some think that this is biased in favor of the South, perhaps they should re-evaluate the facts and their own values, and come to the realization that if they insist on justifying the criminal acts of the North, anything which presents the unbiased facts will seem to them to be ""biased"", if only because it accurately portrays who were the real victims, and who were the unlawful aggressors.Anyway, this DVD set was definitely one of the best-made historical documentaries i have ever seen, and it was a thorough pleasure to watch. If you're already well-versed in American history, you may not learn anything new....but you'll enjoy seeing that history well-presented; and find watching this a thoroughly enjoyable experience; and if this stuff is new to you, or if you're looking for something which will give your kids a more realistic understanding of the times, this will prove very enlightening, and also provide a platform from which to glean a smörgsbord of interesting ideas for future study.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2KA9BFWTBBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KLPAZM#wasThisHelpful","R3B2KA9BFWTBBY","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great classic season of The Simpsons, from when the show was still at it's creative best!There is one thing I do not appreciate: I LOVE the commentaries that accompany EVERY episode- as you can imagine, the people who are responsible for making The Simpsons, are quite entertaining and informative. Having these commentaries is like getting double the value for your money, because the commentaries are as good as the actual show; and over the years, I've actually watched the commentaries multiple times. So what's my complaint, you may ask?My complaint is that Yeardley Smith is on more commentaries in this season than any other thus far! Don't get me wrong, I love what Yeardley does with the Lisa character- I think she is great as a voice actress.....BUT (and I'm sorry to say) the woman is a dolt! All she seems to do on the commentaries, is ask idiotic questions. It's as if one of the other commentators brought in their 5 year-old daughter!Sheesh! We listen to these commentaries to learn what goes on behind the scenes, and to be entertained by the witty people who make this show. Listening to a grown woman, who is actually involved in the show, ask the other crew members idiotic questions that even children know the answer to, is just a waste, and an embarrassment.I mean no disrespect, but it's the truth. For goodness' sake, if anyone connected with the show should happen to read this, PLEASE, for the love of Gawd,  DON'T have Mrs. Smith on future commentaries- if for no other reason than to preserve her dignity!I'm sure I can't be the only one who feels this way. If others reading this agree with me, please add a comment. Thanks.Everything else about this season is a ""10""! Buy it! It's a classic that will endure for many years.

"I bought this for my elderly mother, after several Walmart toasters had proved to be of shoddy quality and short-lived for her. This is the nicest toaster I have seen in quite some time. It's sturdily made and works flawlessly. It does what it's supposed to do, and does it well! It toasts evenly, and I expect it will last a long time.Best thing is: It has a slide-out crumb tray, which makes cleaning it a breeze- i.e. you don't have to lift the toaster to clean out the crumbs...just slide the tray out- very nice feature- especially for the elderly. If I had use for a toaster, I'd buy this one! It even looks smart; and doesn't feel cheesy or tinny, like so many other toasters these days.Also, the bread slots are nice and wide, to accommodate thick bread and bagels and such. They are not especially long though, so if you have very large slices of bread, you'll have to cut them first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24KT84M26IADI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GQ034C#wasThisHelpful","R24KT84M26IADI","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE watching all of Ken (as well as Ric) Burns's stuff. There films are always visually-appealing, engrossing, entertaining masterpieces. The way they can make even still images come alive with sound and movement; and their balanced and thorough treatment of most subjects, makes their works a thorough delight to watch, regardless of your interest in the particular subject being covered.Watching their films truly brings history to life as no book or other documentaries can- and not only that, but they are just so aesthetically well-done, that they are the epitome of the art of entertainment- a veritable smörgåsbord for the senses.I've always been a big fan of Tommy Jefferson's, also- so this DVD seemed like a natural for me! While I would rate the entertainment value of this film as tops, I do feel that it's treatment of the subject matter was a little lacking, and not quite up to the standards I would expect from either of the Burns's.While it does serve as a very good primer and intro to TJ; and as a good basic timeline of his life; and it does a reasonably good job of conveying the context of the times in which he lived, I do feel that it is sorely lacking as far as illustrating the political and philosophical concepts which TJ stood for, and which made him such a genius and a great man.Also, I'm sorry to say, that having a black man narrate most of film [and one with not the greatest voice] did seem to be a blatant contrast to the mood of the period in which the historic events took place, and considering that this piece is about a man who did not see blacks as being quite ""equal"".Kudos to Mr. Burns though, for presenting both sides of issues, such as TJ's alleged diddling of one of his slaves, after his wife's death; and for pointing out that TJ was in-fact an advocate of abolition (and would have even succeeded in accomplishing it, but for one of his foes).One thing that really bugs me (and this is true of virtually all historical books and films) is the careless use of words and phrases which had quite different meanings in the past, than they do today. Words such as ""humanist""; or ""public education""[which, in the 18th and 19th centuries, meant: As contrasted with religious education- i.e. schools which were not started and operated by churches or religious institutions.  It did NOT mean a communal government school paid for through the taxation of all people, like we have today].Failing to make clear the true meaning of words which had vastly different meanings and connotations in the past, can be very misleading to a modern viewer- even if not meant to be so. Our revisionist text-books of today are blatantly guilty of that; only they do so on-purpose.All in all, this is a good intro to the life and times of TJ; as well as a thoroughly enjoyable form of entertainment. While it barely scratches the surface for even the mild history buff or aficionado of TJ, it is none-the-less a very enjoyable watch for all, even if you will not learn anything new from it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVLHYVXW9MHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JP53G#wasThisHelpful","R3JVLHYVXW9MHG","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just picked up a package of these today at a local salvage store....had a few tonight with a cup of tea...and just ordered a whole case!These biscuits are not overly sweet; and not heavy at all. They are not heavily flavored, either....but yet, there is just something irresistible about them! They're kind of the consistency of graham crackers, but not as sweet or imposing- but they are not bland like shortbread biscuits. I usually tend to like things with very bold taste...but these crackers are the exception- not bold at all- quite the opposite- and yet, delicious and addictive! Even though they're ""chocolate"", you really don't even taste the chocolate- and yet it does something to contribute to the overall effect. They're quite unique; Perfect with tea or coffee- as they don't affect the taste of what you're drinking; and yet they taste GREAT! Minimal...but not bland. And fairly low-cal, too!!!!

"Wow! For a total price (item+shipping) that amounts to less than what a set of cheap sheets would cost you at Wallyworld, you get a really nice, soft, good-looking set of quality 100%-cotton sheets, here!The fitted bottom sheet is over-sized -it is big even on my pillow-top mattress- but that really isn't a problem- although i would prefer a little tighter fit (these are actually loose!)- so I am confident, that these will fit the thickest mattresses with ease. If you have a thin mattress, the fitted sheet may be too big.Other than that, they are just a great sert of sheets for the price- I'll be ordering more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9YP333RRZ3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UWI78Q#wasThisHelpful","R3O9YP333RRZ3I","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had initially purchased a slightly cheaper grinder (A Sportsman MEG300) which worked O-K, but which I returned because replacement blades were unavailable for it (it used a non-standard blade). Bought this LEM as a replacement for that grinder...and I am IMPRESSED!This grinder is much more robust, and the parts which do the work are much heavier-duty than the other grinder. It's well-designed and easy to clean, and it works like a charm! I use it for grinding mainly top round and eye round into lean chopmeat, and it just does it so fast and effortlessly; makes me feel like a pro.The case is plastic and feels a little on the light side- but hey, this is meant for home use- and if you treat it well, I'm sure it'll be O-K. I mean, lets face it, for a grinder at this price point, there have to be compromises- and one is not going to get a stainless steel housing for a hundred bucks.The beauty is, that the ""business"" parts- i.e. the grinding tube and the plates, etc. are very well made, and feel very beefy. It is a size #8, and accepts standard #8-size parts- like blades and plates, so when/if you need replacements, you can purchase them readily, many places. (The slightly cheaper grinder was only a #5, and used some special proprietary parts which the manufacturer didn't even sell)One thing to note: This unit is not for grinding bone- as per the manufacturer's manual. If you need to do some heavy-duty grinding, you'll likely need a more expensive machine- but for grinding up just plain-old trimmed meat at home, this baby will get 'er done...and quickly and quietly! And I expect that it will last, as it seems built very well in all the places that matter. Very good quality for the low price.I thought my previous grinder was pretty nice- but now that I have this, the old one pales by comparison- this one is just so much better; more powerful; robust; faster (but not noisier) and feels so much more substantial/built heavier (but not heavy to carry).I am very pleased with it. It's like moving up to a Lincoln from a Chevy.  Oh, and a nice touch: When you press the regular (forward) power button, it stays on until you press it again- you don't have to hold it continuously- and thus both of your hands can stay free when grinding. The reverse button is a press-and-release (you hold it for as long as you want it to run in reverse) which is exactly the way it should be (I've never had to use the reverse though- as nothing ever gets stuck, thus far...)Well-done, LEM!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FMXUPOQ87DNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PHUMRU#wasThisHelpful","R3FMXUPOQ87DNN","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With it's amazing battery life; seemingly infinitely customizable sound; and a wealth of features, this is an AMAZING MP3 player if you [liker myself] are just looking for a dedicated music player. Yes, it's got video; and some other accessories, but this device is primarily made for playing audio- and it does that well. The other things are just gimmicks- and if you're into those other things, there are other devices which do them better.The only real problem I see with the user interface/touch screen, is scrolling. For everything else, once you've played with it for a day and learn how to navigate, it's a piece of cake. Scrolling remains tricky, though.  At least it has tactile buttons for the important things- and they work great.The bad news is: The manual for this player is WORTHLESS. It doesn't tell you how to use the majority of features...or even that they exist! (and it has some advanced features, like the ability to automatically replay just a part of one track)- However, you can look online at the manual for the Cowon J3, which has many of the same features, and uses a similar interface, and figure out the features that the two have in common)That's the good news.The bad news is: Cowon sucks!For one, they seem to have a quality control issue. I had to return my first X9 due to a battery issue. I'm now returning it's replacement due to it not connecting to the computer. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment, but I like this player so much, I'm going to try a third one. Ridiculous, I know- and it does not bode well for the longevity of the product, if I can't get one that even works right when it's brand-new! (If other companies made mp3 players with batteries of this size and capacity, I wouldn't even consider repurchasing this!)Cowon's technical support and customer service is a joke. The only way to contact them if you have an issue, is through email. They warn you that quite a few popular ISPs and webmail services don't make it through to them- and then tell you if you use one of those services, to get another email account from a service that does get through to them! (Absurd! Why don't they just resolve the problem that prevents their equipment from dealing with certain services and providers???)Then, when you contact them, they take days to get back to you. And of course, when they do get back to you, it's the standard ""Reset your unit; upgrade the firmware..."" script. (How can I upgrade the firmware if my X9 will not connect to my computer, which is the problem I contacted them about??!! DUHhhhh!!!!)Then they want you to submit a request for an RMA; and ""if it is approved"", you pay for postage to send it back, and at best can expect a refurbished X9 in trade for your 32 day-old X9!SKEW-REW THAT! I'm just returning mine to Amazon. (If you're going to chance buying one of these...only do so from Amazon- not from the manufacturer, or anyone else, or you'll be SOL if there's a problem!)I'll try one more time with a replacement unit....but I'd NEVER buy anything ever again from Cowon. It's a shame. This could be an awesome player- and is quite unique- but poor quality control and poor customer service kill it.I'll let you know what happens with my third and final one when I get it!UPDATE Oct. 1st, 2014. Third try seems to be a charm. I've been using my latest X9 for over a month, now....and it is working fine. AHhhh!

"Initially, I found these gloves to be very uncomfortable, for some reason- even though they fit perfectly. After not having worn them for a year, I decided to try them again....and now they feel fine!Anywho....these are thin, light gloves which will keep your hands warm in moderate weather. I don't ride when it's much below 40*F, but they seem to do a fine job in the 40's, and they block the wind nicely, while not making my hands sweat. If you ride when it's colder than the upper 30's, I'd say you'd need a heavier glove, as I wore them once in the upper 30's with some wind, and my hands were on the verge of getting cold.They're made well, and designed well, so that no seams or other protuberances get in the way between your hands and the hoods/bars- and they're easy to get on and off.

"I bought this for a relative who was a fan of the show, who then lent it to me- and as I had never watched the show back in the day, I thought maybe it would be something to watch. How did this show ever stay on the air for YEARS? I really don't know how anybody can watch this crap! Funny thing is, the person for whom I bought it, who had been desiring to see the show again after not having seen it in many years, also wondered how she ever had liked it!This is silly, totally unrealistic, unbelievable nonsense, with no redeeming features. (I guess women just liked it for Tom Selleck...and perhaps boys liked it for the car? ""Next week on Magnum P.U: Tom Selleck takes off his shirt, and then does a burn-out with the car""- Yes folks, there is a formula for a winning TV show! :D)I tried it, being an avid fan of old shows (I watch NO modern TV) but this show is just gawd-awful. I'm embarrassed for the producers who made this; and for the fact that enough of my fellow countrymen watched it, to keep it on the air! (And the scary thing is, that there were a whole genre of shows similar to this- such as The A-Team...and can we ever forget ""Manimal""? LOL! Oh, how I wish I could forget that such shows ever existed. I may be a nostalgia buff, but sadly, the 80's seemed to be a dark decade for TV series- with shows like this prospering, and a few very good shows, such as It's Your Move falling by the wayside) Magnum P.I.?

"This has been one of my favorite movies of all time, for more than half of my life! This movie is NOTHING like your typical teenage underdog/bully story; and nothing like modern movies- i.e it is not just a bunch of clichés strung together; and the characters are unique and ""real"". It's a ""feel good"" movie, but with depth; and all the quality touches of a movie that was made to be enjoyed by adults.

"I'm not an insomniac, but I do play something at night, on continuous loop, to mask outside noises, as I am very sensitive even to the slightest noise. I've noticed since doing this, that some of these products can actually help me fall-off quicker. Unfortunately, this is not one of those! In fact, I found this one annoying. I do realize that opinions on this subject are largely a matter of personal taste and preference, but I do feel that this recording has some major flaws, which many people will find fault with- as follows:First, the volume is NOT consistent. Some parts are loud; others are very soft. Some parts have a strong bass base [sorry...but I can't think of any better way to say to say that!) which I find to be very conducive for both masking noise, and inducing sleep- while in other sections, the bass goes almost flat. This not something you want when trying to sleep.Secondly: While it is not apparent in the sample track here on Amazon, a piano is used throughout this recording. In my opinion, although I do normally enjoy piano music; pianos are not conducive to sleep.Thirdly: There is a simple, repetitive melodic theme played by the piano, throughout. Having an identifiable melody- especially a constantly repeating one- is NOT a good thing when trying to sleep- it creates monotony; anticipation; expectation; and awareness of time.Three big fails, in my book- but hey, for the price, it was worth a shot!","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDSUXTB2EZ90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EEMRJ2#wasThisHelpful","RKDSUXTB2EZ90","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hesitant to order season 15- not having previously seen any of these episodes, and in light of how bad the last few seasons had been- but desperate for a Simpsons fix, I gave it a shot. You can imagine my surprise, when I popped in the first DVD, and started watching the first ep- a Treehouse Of Horror ep, which are never among my favorites- and lo and behold it was a gem!Ditto for many more episodes.Watching the first half of this season, I saw that the crew at The Simpson's seems to have pulled themselves out of the years-long slump that they were in. Most of the magic of the early seasons is back! (The humor; the use of many favorite secondary characters, etc.)O-K, still, a lot of the intelligent wit is still missing....but hey, at least the show is vastly improved from recent years- well...at least that is true for the first half of this season. The second half of this season is where it appears that the crew started running out of steam again. Once again, they start to revert back to plot-centric episodes, where it appears that they put all their effort into the story line, and neglect the humor and the little touches that often make the show so great. (Not that I can blame them- seeing as it so much work to make these shows, and that many of them have been working on this show for so many years...I mean, they're only human.)But all in all, in my book, half of a good season is better than an entire bad season, so I can't complain (Though I might have, had I paid full price for this season! For half-price- which is what I paid- half a season of good eps seems about right:D)My biggest complaint about this season: TOO MANY MUSICAL numbers. And I'm not just talking about the one musical episode (Why-oh-why do they torture us by making Yeardley Smith sing??!! Please...PLEASE stop!). The use of popular-music cues over montages is done in just about every episode- to the point of being cliché. I mean, such can be effective when done when appropriate, to good effect, and with restraint- but it seems as though the Simpson's crew has started using such as a crutch to merely fill space. (It's showing, guys!)The BEST thing about this season, is [drum roll].....the COMMENTARIES! Yes! In past seasons, it had seemed like those doing the commentaries had lost interest- but this season, they back to their former glory. I normally enjoy listening to the commentaries as much as/or even more than watching the actual show- and this seasons commentaries were no disappointment. I was in my glory listening to the commentary on every episode. I think writer Tom Gammill was on just about every one...and he is one of my all-time favorites, so that also helped!Again, like earlier seasons, the commentaries were once again very enjoyable; informative and funny. Kudos to all those who participates, for taking the time to do these commentaries. Some of REALLY enjoy them! (I take back what I said earlier. The price of this season would be justified just for the commentaries, alone!).All-in-all...at least 10 very good episodes; and all good commentaries- makes this season add up to 75% good content. But I'm giving it 5 stars for the great commentaries! (I should deduct 4 stars for the continuation of the LOUSY packaging!).If you're a fan of the earlier Simpson's...this season is for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I44AGWGKRREI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DW5YJI#wasThisHelpful","R1I44AGWGKRREI","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved the way this grinder worked, and it seemed well-made and like it was a bargain....but I quickly found out, when needing a new blade for it, that standard #5 blades do not fit (even though they are the correct diameter, this unit uses a proprietary blade, which is THINNER than standard blades, and thus will not allow you to assemble the plate and retainer when using any other blade!).I called the company which manufactures it (Buffalo tools) and they DO NOT sell a replacement blade for it!!!! I was told to ""Try our competitors; they may have one that fits.""!!!! (They don't!)What good is a grinder for which new blades are not available? I've scoured the interweb, and came up with NOTHING!This could be a great product, but without the ability to replace common external parts, it is worthless! Be aware.Back to Amazon it goes!

"UPDATE: 11/1/13: I continue to be amazed and impressed with this Hitachi! My place looks better than it ever has, because for the first time in my life, I actually enjoy weed-eating...so now I do it much more often; plus, even though it holds only half as much line as my old trimmer...the line lasts 6 times as long without me needing to reload (even when doing around fences, which used to chew up line on my old trimmer); and when it is time to reload...it is SO fast and easy with this baby! I just LOVE this thing! And get this: Even after sitting for a week or two, it will start on the very first pull, if I put the choke lever halfway between open and closed! Amazing! This is the best weed-whacker I've ever had, bar none! If you need more convincing, here's my original review:I JUST received this weed-eater not a few hours ago (From that blue home-improvement store.....as Amazon still hadn't shipped it after 9 days, even though it said ""in-stock""...) and have just literally come in from using it for the last two-and-a-half hours. I am in LOVE with this thing!Surprise! It started on the 3rd pull of it's maiden run, after taking it out of the box (Would have started on the 2nd, if I had taken the choke off sooner!)- and ever since, it has started on the very first pull! The fact that it starts so easily takes 3/4's of the work out of weed-eating. After 2.5 hrs. of use, I feel as fresh as when I had started- something I sure could not say about my old trimmer- even though they weigh about the same.Surprise #2: This puppy is QUIET! First time in my life that I haven't needed to wear ear-muffs while trimming- and even after 2.5hrs, my ears aren't ringing; I'm not aurally stressed(I HATE noise!!!); and I believe that this quietness also contributes to the fact that I feel so fresh, even after the long use in 90* humid weather!SURPRISE NUMERO THREE: The line that came already installed on the spool, lasted for the entire job...and there's still plenty of it! By contrast, on my old trimmer, I'd have to change the line about once every 1/2 hour, as it would get chewed-up really fast around fences and posts and other obstructions.  Funny, too, because one of the reasons I chose this Hitachi over the Echo SRM 225, is because of the ease of changing it's line; and the split spool, which seems like it will prevent the line from binding! Although I haven't had to change the line...I did take the spool off, and it is so fast and easy to do.....I am just amazed! Also, the split spool does indeed prevent the line from binding on itself, as this baby feeds line effortlessly!Basically, this is a well-designed product, that works as it should. No gimmicks..no BS. -just solid performance; and it gets the job done, without making you have to fool around.Between the quietness; the easy starting; and not having to constantly wind new line...I will be weed-eating a LOT more with this Hitachi than I did with my old Bolens!Anther great feature: The throttle control is well-designed and sturdy, and is very responsive. This, in conjunction with a clutch that kicks in at quite low RPMs, allows great throttle control- which in-turn allows one to just feather it (use very low RPMs) around obstructions- so the line does not break....and there is less chance of damaging things. I LOVE it!Natrurally, since I've only had it for a few hours, I can't speak of it's longevity...but I'd done plenty of looking around on the internet for info and experiences with this model, and I've yet to see any complaints about failure of major parts, such as the motor, clutch or driveshaft- so I have  no worries that this unit will last. (Heck, I got 9 years out of my old el-cheapo Bolens...and I live on 28 acres...). Have only seen a few colmplaints of ignition module failure- which is the most common malady with most 2-cycle engines...so hopefully all will be well.A FEW CAVEATS: The muffler guard (little plastic cage around the muffler which prevents you from burning yourself on the hot muffler) was already broken in several places when my unit arrived. I was a little worried, because Hitachi is not known for great customer service, I figgered[sic] they might not send me a replacement part, but rather, might insist i send the unit back to the retailer or to an ""authorized service center""- but luckily, they are indeed sending me a new muffler guard, as they admitted that this is a known defect (The guy on the phone acted like he was doing me a big favor by doing this!).For those counting on the 7-year warranty....I wouldn't count on it, unless you live very close to a service center- as Hitachi will generally not ship replacement parts to the consumer under warranty, and insists that you deliver the unit to a service center (Except for the exception above)- which generally costs as much in gas/postage [Not to mention being without your tool for who-knows-how-long....] as just buying the darn parts and fixing it yourself- which I guess is what they count on. But, hopefully, unless one gets a lemon, they will not be needing warranty service.The only negative reviews/complaints I tend to see about these Hitachis, seem to be from people who aren't familiar with 2-stroke equipment- and that is understandable, because if you don't already have a clue about 2-strokes....the manual is NOT going to help you at all- but if you have at least basic experience with weed-eaters/chain-saws; etc. then you'll be right at home with this Hitachi, and pleasantly surprised at how great it truly is!As mentioned, I live on 28 acres, so my outdoor power equipment gets quite a bit of hard use. I've learned to pay a little more, and just get the good stuff. I'm good at keeping the cheaper stuff running...but considering the hours of use, I can tell you that it's a joy for just a few more dollars than a generic junk brand, one can get something like this, which pays huge dividends in ease of use and by not creating frustration. Ultimately, I can get more work done with this Hitachi, in less time, and feel like I haven't even done anything afterwards!Oh, and some other reviewers have complained that the shield down by the trimmer head is not big enough to be effective. I don't know if perhaps Hitachi has fixed that issue or what, but I have found the shield on mine to be better than previous trimmers I've had. I get less junk thrown on me while weed-eating with this Hitachi...and the line cutter on it works very well, also.All-in-all, this is the best weed-eater I've ever had.I will update this review in the future/as needed.Very glad that I bought this Hitachi. Many of my neighbors have Stihl products...which, despite their high cost, always seem to be in the shop with carburetor troubles and other maladies. And you can forget the Poulan/Bolens/Crapsman[Craftsman]/Ryobi/Homelite/etc. products...unless you have a tiny yard, and don't mind a lot of frustrations and poor design which ends up sapping your energy. Get this Hitachi....you will LOVE it!

"I grew-up in, and spent a good part of my life in Ronkonkoma. Back in the late 60's and 70's when I was a kid, there were still a lot of the landmarks and remnants of it's glorious past, which are documented in this book! I was hesitant to buy this book at first, figuring that the pictures would be the same ones which I've seen for years on the internet....but they're not! (O-K, a small percentage are...but  not most!). Or I thought perhaps half the book would be occupied by pics of the ubiquitous Agnew & Taylor Hardware store (There are some, but the book is not dominated by them- thankfully!)I can sit with this book and daydream about my wonderful childhood in the still-glorious 60's and 70's when Ronkonkoma was still a nice mix of rural charm and suburbia, and yet only 60 miles from NYC. My mother and I would walk to the lake on hot summer days; passing many of the remnants of Ronkonkoma's hey-day; and I'd even play on the ruins of the pavillians at the beach. I can even see my childhood home in several of the photographs- which is the first opportunity in my life I've had the pleasure to see what my former home and neighborhood looked like prior to myself having lived there!The author's employment of several of James Mooney's wonderful aerial photographs from the 50's and 60's was a natural! One could only wish he would have used more of them, as nothing captures the essence of the place like those photographs! (Some of you may remember, back when Robin's Hardware was still extant, the owner, Georgie Erotakis(sp?) had a bunch of Mr. Mooney's photographs displayed along his counter. It was such a treat just to go in there to buy a nut or bolt, and spend an hour looking at the photos and talking to George and his wife!)There are a few inaccuracies- such as where a photo is shown of the old original bank at Hawkins and Portion- and the caption says that it is now owned by the Ronkonkoma Fire Dept. -He fails to mention that the building now there was built in the late 50's and is NOT the same building pictured in the photograph. And a few other inaccuracies; locations slightly off, etc. But such does not in any way detract from the enjoyment of this wonderful book!And I could also wish that there had been a little more coverage of the kinds of places where the average people lived and worked- instead of the houses of the ""great men"" and the former tourist accommodations(yawn). I would have liked to have seen some shots of just ordinary residential streets of different decades. What did the residential core area look like in the 30's? How about a few shots of the suburban paradise of the 70's? The bungalow community west of Rosevale avenue?[Small bungalows, mainly used as summer houses in the hey-day, and later used as permanent residences. Sheesh! At least one shot from the 70's, showing some of these converted tiny bungalows, with more modern houses interspersed, as became the case by the 60's and 70's. This was a big part of the town's character!)These are not really complaints, mind you; more like suggestions. Perhaps the author/publishers will see fit to expand the book for a future printing? (And C'mon! We really need a shot of the old Woolworth's which occupied Ronkonkoma's first shopping center. Or how about: What did that parcel of land look like before the shopping center was there? I could think of SO much more- but still- for the limited size and scope of this book, the author did a SUPERB job!Kudos for showing a shot from the early 80's, when downtown was starting to look like a slum- after the fire that destroyed Fayne's drug store and Straub's Market, et al. THOSE are the kinds of photographs which are often omitted by others; and which really help to tell the whole story of a point in history that anyone who was there remembers. (More photos from the 70's, PLEEZE!!)As you can tell, I ramble.... But this book is a great trip down memory lane for anyone who remembers Ronkonkoma before it became the over-taxed, oppressive rat-hole that it is now (along with the rest of ""Lawn Guyland"")- or for anyone who wants a good description of what the area was like in former days. I am truly grateful to have had the advantage of having grown-up in what was then such a wonderful place. (I left NY at the turn of this century, and will never again set foot in the hell-hole that it has become!)If you have any connection to or interest in Ronkonkoma....get this book! (And if you still live in the crud-hole that LI has become, get the heck out of there!!! There are still some nice, inexpensive, somewhat free places to live in this country, where the neighbors are still normal...and far enough from you that you don't have to care!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JP8HXXE5UXX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738576565#wasThisHelpful","R2JP8HXXE5UXX7","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an avid cyclist myself, how could I go wrong with a movie about cycling? Well, it was easy...I bought THIS movie! Boring; poorly made; You can't understand half the dialogue for the thick Scottish accents (and I'm usually great at understanding even foreigners with broken-English and thick brogues!); It was formulaic; There's no reason to identify with or have any empathy for the characters; and it seemed like half the movie consisted of the riding of a bicycle around in circles. Total waste of time- not one redeeming quality! It's as if someone assembled a series of images and cheap video clips for a Youtube video!

It stays put (Doesn't get knocked around in the wind or on bumps); is unobtrusive; gives you a great view (So much easier than turning your neck- you'll check your rear view 20x as often, because all it takes is a glance). It's made of very sturdy ABS-like plastic- I've had one for over a year now, and it's still like new after 3000 miles...and I just bought another one for a newly acquired bike.

This, and a hi-vis jersey will increase your safety exponentially.Assembly may seem difficult to some, as the screws can be a little tight and hard to turn- but this is the way it's supposed to be, and it works, because once properly assembled and installed....it never loosens up. Installation is very easy. The instruction sheet they provide could be better- it would benefit from clearer diagrams...but it's not rocket surgery....you'll ""get"" it.This is the single greatest bicycle accessory in the history of the world!And it even looks nice- not cheap-looking. They seriously need to make a SRAM and Campy version!It even includes 2 allen wrenches, for the tool-deprived, which is all you need for assembly.Just be careful when you unpack it, as there are a few TINY screws and washers that could easily get lost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMIU505XYJ5AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BYK3WE#wasThisHelpful","RMIU505XYJ5AH","A3ATD1VNKRQ23C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATD1VNKRQ23C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the older incarnation of this saddle on my Klein. These babies are light; high-quality and very comfortable! In my opinion, these narrow saddles are the way to go [Of course, saddle comfort is a very personal matter- and is dependent upon your own bodily proportions...]. Saddles of this shape are getting harder to find, as many manufacturers are going with more ""modern"" designs- but this more traditional style offers the perfect blend of performance; comfort; and even looks, without any compromises. They are comfortable even if you ride without chamois- as I often do. I'm surprised to see them here on Amazon and for such a low price, while Brooks saddles are much more expensive and more popular, even though, in my opinion, they are inferior to these wonderful saddles!I just happened to ""luck into"" these saddles, as one came on the used bike that I purchased....and what luck it wa- as it enabled me to discover the perfect saddle, which I otherwise might not have tried.

"This hamper does not look as nice in person as it does in the picture. Looks almost black, in actuality. The finish is not of the quality I would expect for such a price ($73)- instead of looking like a quality, classy piece, it looks rather cheap and ""dirty"". Also, the woven panels feel cheap and flimsy- I wouldn't expect it to last. Not what I would expect for this price- seems more like something you'd get at the dollar store for $20. (I will actually be replacing this with a dollar store hamper! The dollar store hamper seems light years ahead of this one, for little more than a quarter of the price).I rarely return things...but there is no way I'm keeping this thing for what I paid for it! If you're looking for quality...this isn't it. And the packaging! It was wrapped in plastic acetate, and cushioned with a very wimpy styrofoam, which breaks into a million pieces if you just look at it- and had such a charge of static electricity, that it seemed to have it's own force field! If you do buy one of these, unpack it outdoors, because it will make a MESS in your house, that you will be cleaning for days to come.This is one instance where I am very thankful for Amazon's liberal and accommodating return policy- because i wouldn't be thrilled with this piece if it were $25- much less for the $73 that I paid for it!

Very nice quality at such a low price- they look more expensive than they are- no worries about making your nice bike look cheap. Nicely made and well designed....they're pretty much perfect.On the backside of the mounting holes, there is a raised area, so that the area around the screws is the only part of the cage that actually touches your frame- a very nice consideration if you have a nice bike whose finish you want to protect.

I love the way it feels; I love the amount of cushioning; and it still looks and feels like it's brand-new. I'll be sticking with this, exclusively!As others have said: This is a very nice quality tape and at a great price- comfortable and good-looking; stretchable and very easy to apply/allows do-overs. The only complaint I have is that the rolls are a little short. If you like to do a figure-8 around your brifters, you'll come up short if you have wide bars. On my narrowish bars, I just BARELY made it to the end- nothing left to cut.They do provide those little strips to tape on around the back of your brifters [I still do the fig-8, even if I use the strips), as well as nice shiny end-caps and finishing tape with the Profile Design logo on it.C'mon, Profile Design- just give us a few more inches, and you'll win a lot more customers!

"The Ringside Gel Wraps is great protecting your knuckles from injury when you are engaged in any kind of activity where you box. I am not a fighter nor a practitioner of any kind of MMA but every once in a while when I work out in the gym, I hit the punching bag as a kind of cardio workout to put up the proper heart rate before lifting weights. I used to do it with bare knuckles, care not to hit the bag hard as to injure my knuckles. With these wraps, I could hot the bag harder than ever before and the cushion these wraps have really protects my knuckles. It conforms perfectly in my average sized hand, not too tight but not loose either. The wrapping around the wrist is also great at giving your wrist the proper support every time you throw a punch. Now instead of warming up in one of those cardio machines in the gym, I just box all around the punching bag until I sweat and hit my target heart rate.

The vitamin composition and their contents are right on the spot for your daily recommended dose. Like all gals nearing 50 or are in their 50's, I take these multi-vitamins as a form of supplement, to rectify or reinforce what you lack or may get from normal food.

"The Vicks Sweetdreams Cool Mist Humidifier is a handy implement to have in your house, especially during below freezing temperatures in winter where the indoor air tends to be really dry and starts to affect a variety of malaise in your household. Aside from the great functionality of the Vicks Sweetdreams Cool Mist Humidifier, it is also very easy to fill with water and very easy to clean. I like the fact that this can be used with the Vicks Scent Pads where you can use it if someone has a cold and clogged nose. The menthol vapos from the vapopads relieves clogged nose and can help a cold sufferer get a good night sleep. The projector feature is another plus and can help calm your sick child by looking at the images. Great implement and I highly recommend to have this in your household.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAB57157N5JI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014P0LJSW#wasThisHelpful","RAB57157N5JI5","A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can absolutely tell just by the packaging that these are not just ordinary Swiss chocolates.

"I gave the Goody's Back and Body Relief Shot 3 stars not because it is not effective but because it is kind of an overkill considering the 1,000mg dose you get per shot. Unless you have recurring back pains or the pain is debilitating, the 1,000mg contents per shot is more than enough to address any kind of minor pains. Sure it will relieve the pain but reading the literature of this OTC med, especially the liver warning part, gave me caution in actually using it as recommended. Use this only if the pain is unbearable or if it the pain restricts normal movement. Otherwise, a smaller dose is all you need. Also drink plenty of water when using this to fully dilute it and flush it out of your body once pain relief is achieved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMDAFM9W3D32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEMPG6M#wasThisHelpful","RTMDAFM9W3D32","A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Goody's Headache Powder, Mixed Fruit Blast provides a quick relief to minor headaches. I used mine one night at work while having a nagging headache which I thought would go away as my work night progressed. Well, it didn't and it got worse. Taking the right dosage with water and my headache was gone faster than when I took Advil gels. The caffeine in this medicine kept me alert too, working all through the night. The mixed fruit flavor is kind of ""medicine-like"" just like when you take cough syrup. But after washing it down with water, there is no after taste.

I brought this to my work place to really test it out as co-workers use a mix of pencils and ballpens. It has worked pretty good considering it is used several times throughout the day. Some people here complained that it is loud but from my experience, the sound it produces is pretty much tolerable. Its not that you are going to hear it all through my work day. Obviously, when someone is trying to sharpen, it will produce a sound but nothing like so loud like the other people have complained about. So far, its been holding out pretty good.

"I have 2 dogs, both picky eaters. But surprisingly, they both ate the Solid Gold Wolf King Bison and Brown Rice Recipe with Sweet Potatoes Holistic Adult Dry Dog Food.

They seem to have a great time consuming this dog food to the last lick in their bowls. And they have no hesitation whatsoever, once you fill their bowl, they go at it right away.

"The Aladdin Stainless Steel Vacuum Mug really keeps the contents either hot or cold for an extended period of time. It is very well insulated that I put piping hot soup in it and brought it to work. 3 hours later, the soup was still hot! This goes to show that the insulation of this mug is so good, it maintains the cold or hot temperatures of the contents for several hours. It also has a great leak-proof design so even if you accidentally drop it or tumbles inside your car, the liquid contents will stay in the mug. And this mug is so huge, at 16oz, it holds a lot of liquid. The mug is also ergonomically shaped to ensure it will not slip your grip. I like this mug so much that it becomes part of my lunch box.

"In my opinion, the OtterBox Defender Case for Sony Xperia Z4V is by far the toughest case you can get for this phone. This rugged case is built like a tank and with this protecting your phone, it can survive the toughest day-to-day accidental drops, bumps and whatnots you can think of. The layers of protection that this is made of is kind of an overkill but lets be honest, we always want our phone to look shiny, new and scratch-free. Otherwise, we wouldn't really get a case. The buttons are perfectly place to manipulate controls and the cut outs for the camera are precise. Also includes a holster for quick access. Tough and rugged, you can never go wrong with this case as far as protecting your phone is concerned.

"The Belkin Wired Tablet Keyboard with Stand and Micro USB Connector for Samsung Galaxy Tablets is a total hit accessory for your tablet. Great when you need to do a lot of typing with your tablet, takes away the mistake is touch-typing. I have a 10-inch Samsung Galaxy tab that I use for work and this keyboard is very handy when typing a lengthy emails to my boss or my co-workers. The typo error is greatly minimized by using this keyboard compared to touch-typing in the tablet. This is a plug and play device, no other software is needed. The keyboard is also the right size, big enough to accommodate your hands while typing but not small enough to feel awkward when typing. The QWERTY button are neatly spaced out, minimal adjustment with your hands are needed to finally get that exact ""feel"" when you are typing. Also comes with a stand to hold the keyboard at a comfortable angle.

"The JAM HX-P930 Trance Plus Wireless Light Show Speaker is a decent sounding  Bluetooth speaker that produces soothing light as you are playing your favorite tunes. I listen to a lot of jazz and I found that while the sound is good in lower volumes, it kinda distort a little bit once you raise the volume up. I am comparing this to the Logitech UE MINI BOOM Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - Black which I currently use. Though the one from Logitech sounds a bit better, the JAM HX-P930 Trance outputs a more powerful sound. Just don't put the volume all the way up. There were no pairing problems with my Android smartphone and my iPod. Didn't take long for these devices to discover and pair with the JAM speaker. The light show adds a bit of touch to the audio. Love it while playing music in a dark room, trying to induce my sleep to sleep by looking at the speaker.

"Great way to add instant shade to your car if you do not have tinted windows. I have tints in my windows and I have the legal 35 percent which I feel is still not dark enough. I used the Laser Shades to add the impression that the tints are darker than they usually are. This is especially useful now that it is summer, you are able to maximize the cooling effect of your AC without turning it all the way up. The ones for the rear windshield are great at protecting my leather upholstery from the searing heat of the sun. Adding this to your already tinted windows significantly minimizes the intense heat inside your car when it is parked. Another great thing about the Laser Shades is that they do not reduce or impair your driving visibility. You can still clearly see the vehicle behind you and gauge its distance even at night time. Being detachable, you can always take it down when you need to. Great implement to an un-tinted window and a great addition if you already have tints but want to gain a little bit more darkness in your tints.NOTE: Just to give you some sort of a heads up, before I bought these shades, I called up Amazon's customer service to inquire as to how many pieces of shades will come in this set. I was told  it was 5: 2 for the front windows, 2 for the rear windows and 1 for the rear windshield. However, when the package arrived, it only came with 3 shades: 2 for the rear windows and 1 for the rear windshield. I thought this was some kind of packaging mistake and called customer service to call their attention to this and ask for a replacement. When the replacement arrived, the same number of shades is still 3. I called customer service again and try to verify if there were indeed 5 pieces for this set. The description says 5 but the actual set is just 3. I still kept it though since I really needed it but asked for a partial refund since this was suppose to be 5 shades. Hope this information would help you out in deciding your purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38L0A9CFKQ6BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HESVS6G#wasThisHelpful","R38L0A9CFKQ6BN","A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The VELCRO Brand Hangers are a great implement to hang picture frames or any kind of lightweight thing (within a 3lb limit) without ruining or creating unwanted holes in your wall. Used these to hang picture frames in the hallway leading to the bedroom and they held 3x5 and 5x7 frames perfectly. Also used them to hang a 12x12 whiteboard to leave messages and reminders for my family. They are removable and reusable so if you must move an item to another location, you can remove them from the wall and place them in another location. These are one of those little things that are not expensive but can improve the way you organize anything that you hang on the wall.

"I don't even know how to begin my review on the Fisher-Price Imaginext Ultra T-Rex. This huge toy has a fun factor second to none! It can be intimidating to look at all the pieces at first but everything pretty much is very simple to attach to the already pre-assembled body of this toy. My 6-yr old nephew to whom I gave the task of playing with this toy had very minimal difficulty in assembling this. If you have a child that loves and plays Lego, with a little bit of adult supervision, then this toy will be a walk in the park assembling it. When it is all assembled, that is when the fun factor for this toy kicks in! The T-Rex locomotion are on a set of wheels. The feet may move but to facilitate a smooth walk, a set of wheels in the back and front also turns. This gives the T-Rex the impression of walking a smooth pace. Parts of the face lights up and makes roaring sounds, adding to the already awesome looking fun factor of this toy. You can also shoots things from the front where 2 tubes are located, even shoots the claws! There are little pieces of characters that complements the appearance of the T-Rex, enhances the imagination of the chicld when they role play with this toy. I must say, that I as an adult, had as much fun as my nephew did.

"I love activated charcoal and was super excited to find it in a huge 1lb resealable bag. There are so many uses for activated charcoal. My favorite is as a face mask. It detoxes my skin from everyday toxins and leaves my skin soft and rejuvenated. Another favorite use is as a toothpaste. It does a fabulous job getting out coffee stains.

"I was looking for a great quality Shea butter to use in my homemade lotion/body butter recipe and was happy to stumble across this brand. It was extremely important that the Shea butter be 100% pure and unrefined to mix with my essential oils. This Shea butter exceeded my expectations with that plus it was rich and smooth.

"Well done, poetic!! This is a really outstanding case. It looks far more expensive than it is, everything is where it should be, the device fits in snug enough to not risk falling out , but I have no trouble whatsoever getting my device out. I know that some reviews talked about a super tight fit. This might be something Poetic is working on because an hour after I bought my black case, the listings said that it was not available , with no time given for when it would be. I assume it will be again, however, because this is just a really outstanding case. The keyboard! I am absolutely in love with it. I have no idea how, because this is a small keyboard relative to a normal laptop keyboard, but I don't feel at all like I'm crowding my fingers when typing. As a matter-of-fact, I can whale away pretty much at full speed . The symbols are on the keys where they should be, not moved elsewhere as they are on another keyboard I looked at. The only thing I had any problem with was the backspace because it isn't quite where I expected to be … Probably just a couple of centimeters off , but that is something that you would get used to. The keys feel raised , they make the right noise, and there is sensory feedback letting you know if you might have struck a wrong key. That assumes you can feel it on your desktop or laptop. The case – enclosed keyboard itself fits into the main case extremely well. You just set it in place where it belongs and the magnets are strong enough to hold it there. It can be lifted out and put back in easily. The part that holds the device has perfect cutouts. You can easily feel and reach power, volume, etc. that includes charging hole. Also includes cameras. I do hope that the resume carrying this case because I want to recommended very highly. I have read that there is another case that APPEARS to be the exact same one , and it is cheaper. However I compared the reviews on both and felt that justified my spending $10 more for this one. Do be aware that this is not what I would call a minimalist case, meaning that it is going to take up a little more room in your briefcase than one that doesn't have a keyboard or the margin between edge of device and the edge of case which I'm sure was designed to protect your device if dropped. To me, though I also bought a minimalist case, this is protection that I will want at certain times. You might be wondering how the case operates if you leave the keyboard at home. Extremely well. You can have just the device and it and that works too. Though there is no loop for the attachment of the stylus, there are places you can clip it to. Last but not least, some reviews on other colors mention a chemical smell though I've seen very few if any of that mention with the black one. I do not notice any smell at all. It might be in the dyes used on the other colors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG1NT41YWHB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNWM4GS#wasThisHelpful","R3BG1NT41YWHB1","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mine arrived yesterday and I was delighted with it. It was exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, as small as possible, as then as possible, properly placed cutouts for cameras, volume, power, speakers ; and last but not least, my HDX 8.9 turns off when I close it. It's inexpensive, and in terms of design, that's a steal deal . In terms of materials, it seems about right. So many of them are overpriced for what they are. My only complaint if I were to dig deep, is that it doesn't have any place to clip my stylus. But its description didn't say it did.  I have no idea what it would cost , hence add to our cost to have a stylus loop added to the design , but that would really make it perfect. It could also be maybe a quarter inch bigger on both directions to provide some margin just in case it is dropped, but the whole point of this case is minimalist. I do have a suggestion : when I first put my HDX in it my device did not seem to turn off when I close the case. I discovered that if I push the device as far as possible, creating as tight a fit as possible at the bottom end, when sliding it in, that makes a difference. And while at that , as for how the device fits in it , it's pretty perfect. It is tight enough so there is no possible way you could slide out of the case but it's not so tight that you have to struggle to get your device out. Nice-looking, lightweight, non-bulky, and inexpensive… That is what this case is about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEX4KPBJPHNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHI4MTE#wasThisHelpful","R3HEX4KPBJPHNC","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having done childhood in the 40s when ""Lincoln Logs"" were sold in big enough sets to do something with, fit together well and didn't come with a chemical smell that raised all your instincts to throw them out (let alone the worry about what the Chinese used to stain the wood for export to us), I found this set, made in Maine.  From their website, it sounds like the company was started by a couple who felt the same as I do, and it's mentioned these are stained with a food-safe coloring.  They look just like the ones I had, you can make way more than just the structure pictured on the box because they didn't skimp on pieces or sizes, and I'm not terrified they'll poison my grandchildren. If they do leave reddish stain traces on fingers or their storage bag or carpeting (mine didn't), I'd just put down a sheet.

"I'm not by any means new to technology, but I am new to tablets and had been flirting with an iPad Mini.  Amazon had a special for one day, whereupon I bought the 8.9HDX (3rd Gen) and IMHO, this thing dances swirls around the iPad Mini. Resolution, colors, crispness of images and sound, oh what a difference on sound.  A fair bit of research that day was telling me that Amazon's tablets are, dollar for dollar, superior in hardware and features--this made possible, I'm sure, mainly  because if you get a Fire, you're more likely to buy their apps, books, etc.  That's been true, and it's more than fair.  That said, I was worried that I would not be able to access competitors' websites (or at least it would be made difficult) because somewhere I'd read something along that line and that has not been the case, at all.  There ARE some PlayStore apps that you can't install, either direct from them OR via sideloading and I don't know the extent of that yet; I've only run into it on a game so far.  (Jury's out on that, in other words.)But regarding apps.  When I checked on Amazon's apps prior to ordering, I didn't see much!  However when I went to the same app store through my Fire, whammo!  There was a whole lot more there.  I've found a lot of apps in categories such as ""Productivity"" and I'm thinking maybe the Amazon App store is underrated.Apps aside, this Fire is doing far more than I ever thought it would. Especially great is the microphone on the virtual keyboard that I can use ""speech-to-text"" so I can dictate emails, website URLs, search terms -- anywhere you'd enter text, you can hit the microphone instead.  It has EXCELLENT voice recognition software, even picking up on terms unique to spinning and knitting, slang, purposely mispronounced words such as ""gotta"" and ""whatcha gonna do?"" if you pronounce them clearly.  It picks up on punctuation including ""full caps yes exclamation point"" will give you ""YES!"" In google searching for ""Voice Recognition Commands"" to see what else is there, I keep reading that Android Voice Recog. software seems lacking.  That might be a big plus for the Amazon products.  If so, it's an important feature to me because it saves soooo much time.Youtube videos on this thing are far better than they even are on my laptop, which is excellent.  I have yet to run into a buffer wait, and you can click on the full screen square on the video and that's another place where the very high resolution on the Fire wins the day.Rear camera takes outstanding photos and videos.  I mean, really good.  I exported them off the tablet and onto my laptop and they are crisp, clear, very accurate colors, really good.  The sound is beyond expectation.  I noticed that right away but I'm super aware of it in youtube tutorial videos I call in that are often created by women in other countries with heavy accents.  I was made particularly aware of the sound last night when I installed Netflix app and brought in an episode of Parenthood that I've seen on TV - I could hear background conversation more clearly than I could on TV.  The 4th Gen (2014) has even better sound (I compared the two in an electronics store side by side) but that's simply gravy on already outstanding potatoes and I didn't find myself envious of the difference, and I'm prone to that.And a word about Skype.  I'm crossing my fingers, arms, legs and eyes on this one, because the reviews on the Skype app are horrible.  I didn't expect to be able to Skype on it.  The first try, I did have delayed sound, but it cleared itself after a minute an it was in synch.  The second Skype call was to someone else and we had outstanding picture/sound quality and perfect synch.  So I may have gotten lucky, but my Skype is working really well from what I can tell so far.There is a bit of a learning curve, but Mayday is fast and convenient.  I cannot rave about the 3 Mayday experiences I've had, however, because they were not able to answer my questions without transferring me to someone more experienced; but they're good for basic stuff and quick answers and I may have gotten newbies to the job.  There's a minimalist, but adequate, tutorial and ""owner's manual"" (in quotes) if you hit the ? icon (help).  See those.  And why they don't make it more clear, I don't know, but a finger swipe from the left brings up that program's operating menu.  A finger swipe from the top brings down the Fire's operating menu.  Always.  That's the way it is on everything.  Just figuring out those two constants made everything else quicker to learn.All in all, I'd buy it again without a 2nd thought.  Definitely get into perspective the extra $50 or $100 for more storage because whatever you buy, you're gonna live with it.  Cloud does save the day on that, but I'd really rather not have to think about how much I'm loading onto my device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSI8858EXF97F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHJRYYS#wasThisHelpful","RSI8858EXF97F","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This crazy little wire coil works fantastically on electric coil burners.  Especially great when I'm dyeing yarns and roving in a thin (inexpensive) stainless kettle where I want temperature to get as close to boiling as possible but without any bubbling to felt the fiber.  In other words, that's quite a test.  It gives you temperature control.  Two come in the box.  It does not look like copper to me (dull metal silverish color) so I don't know what that's about, but it works great.  There's a heavier duty one in a zigzag design that I bought also for twice the cost and I don't like it as much.  Whatever you do, stay away from the solid plate diffusers with handle.

"Having researched the heck out of electric teapots, I bought this specifically for fast boiling water for my low tech, inexpensive but extremely effective route to the best cup of coffee ever (Hario ""Slim"" Ceramic Burr coffee grinder + a ""Ready Set Joe"" single cup coffee filter holder).  My water comes to a rolling boil in 2 minutes, then the kettle snaps itself off with an audible click.  Not having to drag a cord attached to the pot lets me keep the corded base plate completely out of the way on my counter and if I wanted to store the pot separately I could store the base on its side against the wall without disturbing the cord's path between unit and wall. I specifically love that it's stainless interior.  Whole unit feels very solid and well-made. Good lid design lets you open the hinged top without steam burns.  This beats microwave or stovetop water heating hands down.

"... they're just not shown first or even in bold print.  Instead, the Japanese/Chinese versions are given first and English follows in smaller print and it's easy to miss.  I think that might be a good sign because I was totally surprised at how good the quality is on this item.  (It's a Japanese product, but made in China.  That makes me wonder if many of the USA companies' outsourcing goes to the cheapest bidder because this Japanese company's product is not junk construction.)Things I love about it:*  Adjustable grind setting wheel does not require any disassembly and it has notched steps from the finest grind (almost powder) if set all the way clockwise until it stops, back to coarse, one click at a time, counterclockwise.  All settings that I tried (finest, at 5 clicks back from finest and at 11 clicks back from finest) were consistently ground without big chunks that fell through the cracks, and I got progressively coarser grounds, in other words, it works.*  Easy to grind!  Relatively.  I have ""frozen shoulder"" which is extremely painful, with limited mobility and I grind it with my bad arm as homeoopathic ""physical therapy.""  If it starts to hurt (no fault of the grinder) I can hold that arm still and swing the Hario instead, which means it's an easy grasp of the unit itself with a woman's hand.* Handle fits onto post with a solid click when it seats, no wobbling and it doesn't feel like its metal housing is made of cheap metal that would wear down and lose its grip over time, quite to the contrary.* Handle's groove lets you hang the whole handle off the top lip vertically for small footprint on the counter.* Base is not a cheap plastic either, but a good quality, see-through, perfectly clear, heavy-enough acrylic, with substance to it.  It looks like glass.  It has markers for 1-cup and 2-cups worth of ground coffee (each of which is a 2-Tbsp., standard coffee measure marker).  So it holds 4 Tbsp. (1/4C) of grounds total.  Maybe more.  Once you visually memorize how much coffee you like per cup, you can grind just that much, then stop.  It hurts nothing to keep additional beans in the hopper for next time, and unscrewing the base doesn't spill the beans because the clear acrylic lid snaps in solidly.  You can lie the top (grinding assembly) on its side while you place filters, etc. if you haven't already done that and the lid doesn't fall out.* The feed path from hopper to ceramic burr grinder mechanism is well designed so you don't have to keep giving the unit a shake or a tap to reposition them.  There are no hangups, they just feed through, and tilting it as you grind doesn't seem to matter either.Only Complaint:The black handle head is hollow, with an outer lip (probably for less weight when storing it on unit) which can be a tad uncomfortable if held against the flat of your palm, but this isn't a biggie at all.  I'm stretching to find a complaint at all.I love this little unit!  It takes me under a minute to grind 1 cup of coffee's worth but it's a smooth, easy operation that for some reason makes me appreciate the fresh coffee even more.  I expect I'll get years of use out of this unit and I'm really glad I bought it.One additional note:  Just in case I got lucky to have instructions that include English and yours doesn't, two important things, stated as such, are (1) don't rotate the handle counterclockwise; and (2) don't rotate it at all without beans going through the mechanism.  Otherwise, for taking it apart to clean, the little instruction sheet does have pictures so you could wing it without the text.  But do look closely because I had to in order to see the English instructions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0UMT85QNUIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001804CLY#wasThisHelpful","R2W0UMT85QNUIC","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The heating element's well is also covered with smooth stainless, therefore fully reachable for cleaning which is not the case with the Presto.I like the exterior water level indicator, but also just discovered that even the coffee basket has Tbsp. markers which could be convenient for some.  I have yet to see any coffee grounds in the coffee.  I buy beans in bulk and set grinder to ""electric perk"" but no filters seem to be needed, which I did use with the Presto.  Coffee stays at an ideal hot temperature and continues to remain non-bitter after several hours, and did remarkably well even with a small amount of coffee left in the pot (an unintended test).  I did taste a metallic tinge in the first 6 pots which was starting to become a deal breaker, but then I ran a stem brush through the inside of the stem with Dawn, which fixed it.  The only complaint I have which is minor and subjective is that the green ""on"" light indicator is ridiculously bright.  The good side of that, however, is that you're unlikely to leave it on when you shut off the lights to go to bed.  Exterior surface is brushed stainless and does not show fingerprints.  I've had it only a week, but by that time my Presto was already showing corrosion pitting on (and inside) the stem's well where the heating element is.I will come back and revise if anything changes, but I make multiple 6 or 8-cup pots of coffee all day long so a week for us is comparable to a lot longer time period for most households.  I've had a lot of coffee brewing/percolating machines, and this one is passing all my tests amazingly well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2VYYBYLU2KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4VVLI8#wasThisHelpful","R3H2VYYBYLU2KI","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been wearing Cuddl Duds for a long time and they've changed over the years.  Now they come in a zillion styles so you have to be very careful you're ordering what you think you are (e.g., ""softwear"" comes with stretch and a rayon/spandex based blend, and ""with lace edging"" comes in a blend of cotton (underside for warmth) and nylon (outerside for slide-y, non-bunching surface against your jeans or other pants).  The latter are what I'm writing about--the cotton/nylon blend.I recently bought a pair of these ""Cuddl Duds Women's Softwear Lace Edge Legging"" and just ordered a second through Amazon.  Here is info how to get the fit you want.1.  If the fit is right, out of the box, do not put them in your dryer.  Handwash and hang to dry.2.  If the fit is way bigger than you expected (they do now seem to run large), wear them to be sure you don't find you actually like them a little loose.  But if you don't, then machine wash and do put in the dryer.  They will shrink.  And I believe if you repeat, they might even shrink down more yet.  Now just be aware, if you machine dry them, when you first put them on, you might notice that the back (bum area) has snugged up along with the legs, but that the waist front comes up to your midriff.  (Awk???!)  Don't worry about it.  As soon as you wear them around and sit in them, the back stretches back out to accommodate your body and the front no longer seems long.  They do give, back toward (not necessarily fully to) their original size prior to what they were before machine drying them.  But I still think that repeated machine drying shrinks them down.I have a pair, same type, same fiber blend, same size, purchased 5 years ago that I repeatedly ran through the dryer.  They fit very snug.  That could be because of the dryer, or it could also be that in that 5 years the sizing has changed.  I suspect some of both because I don't recall them having been particularly loose, as these are, when I first got them.  I'm finding I actually prefer the looser fitting ones though.  They seem warmer to me when I'm outside, including in cold winds, and I like that they aren't cling'd right to my skin for all day wear.Regardless of how they fit, tight or loose, these are magical in that they definitely keep you enough warmer outside to earn their keep.  Yet at the same time, they're a thin fabric compared to any other leggings, e.g., ""thermals"".  Inside the house, however, you don't notice them at all, they are not hot feeling.  They don't show under clothing and they don't make your pants bunch up at the crotch like other thermals do because your pants slide right over them. Very highly recommended, specifically this style.  I don't know about the other fabric blends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6U2USYESC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F928FVA#wasThisHelpful","R3O6U2USYESC3","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My planned use for context in comparison with your planned use:Two of 3 fans mounted near the ceiling, about 2-3 ft. to the left and right of my office wood stove, in hopes that the risen hot air could be urged (diagonally) across a 13'x15' room toward a doorway into the kitchen.  The 3rd would then be at the top corner of the office/kitchen doorway itself.  My fan mount placement has to be revised on the wood stove's side and I haven't yet mounted the doorway one.  Once I get it all tweaked, will revise review to include the effectiveness of this plan.  Meanwhile...Build:  Basically it's like a computer fan wrapped in a sturdy square black metal frame with a brown 11-ft. electrical cord that has an on-cord power switch about 2 ft. from the wall plug.  (If you don't like that placement, hardware stores do sell on/off switch pieces that you can pinch-clamp anywhere on a cord, which pierce little prongs through the cord for their contacts).  Sturdy housing, fan appears study also.  Note there is some weight to sturdy, so see ""tilt"" notes below.Mount:  Bracket screws onto wall w/provided screws.Tilt:  Fan bracket tilts up and down plus left to right.  No built in ""stopper notches"" in the tilt so that depending on your mounting plan, you may need to tinker via a well-positioned holding nail to keep the angle you want, but anything would be do-able, including mounting it onto a piece of 1x2 or 1x4 which, itself could be mounted to wall via a swing hinge.  In other words, its bi-directional tilt is handy alone or combined with what you fashion additionally.Noise:  Neither of the two that I have mounted are bothersome, they're steady white noise.  One is quieter than the other though, just so you know that noise can vary from unit to unit.Wind force:  Hard to describe, but here's my best shot:  If you wanted it to cool your face, you'd need to be (guessing) 3-4 ft. from it for a light breeze.  My thought for my heat displacing purpose was that, compared to the heat-driven fans that sit on top of wood stoves (that sell for over $110 and appear to reduce effectiveness over time), these would have significantly more air moving power and be able to be placed along ceiling where hot air gathers.  Once I tweak my placement better, will modify review to share what I find works.  I do think the one place I don't yet have one yet (doorway) might be key but we just haven't gotten to it yet.Conclusion:  Seeing them in person, I'm not disappointed in the quality at all.  Tilt angle stopper notches would have been helpful and a tad more power also, but given their small size I'm not sure they could be by much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34J37MMCH8JBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FXVJ1U#wasThisHelpful","R34J37MMCH8JBE","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, my broom isn't as pictured either - it's a black, square-headed broom and it works GREAT.  The handle screws into the broom head (not glued), by the way, just FYI.Meanwhile, these tools are fantastic for two things - cleaning out my wood stoves via their front door access and ash pans, and for tweaking along any fire you'd open your front doors to access.  Might also be great for side-door access but I can't speak to that.Details:  The broom head is only slightly wider than the shovel, which has a perfectly flat even floor so the shovel acts as a perfect dust pan for ashes you sweep up with the broom.  It's also an ideal width for getting around andirons for ash removal from stove interior.  The poker is a GEM.  A simple right angle turn without angles or curves, it gives you super control when tweaking the placement of kindling and beginning logs.  Also sturdy enough to lift big ones for readjustment.  The whole set is ideal for all tasks that are normally done without distance required, and I really appreciate not having to balance longer tools for that.  The handles are ergonomically comfortable with good grasp control, and all three tool handles loop readily over other fireplace tool holder stands which is what I do because I don't want 2 stands in the way, but the stand that comes with it is sturdy.  I do use my long poker for adjusting logs in fully established fires when loading through the top door, but anything I need to do through the front doors, I find these safer and way easier to handle.I ordered one set and liked it so much that I ordered a second for my other stove.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJS5DX0VCILJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CEOQR6#wasThisHelpful","RJS5DX0VCILJH","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I ordered these before reading reviews, then did so after the fact.  So when they arrived I now expected them to be junk.  They barely had a chance to prove themselves because I already had it in for them -- I was going to hate them.Now I'm a woman so all fireplace gloves are one-size-fits all and these are as big as my Vermont Castings ""serious"" gloves, but at first these wanted to make my hands scoot out of them because after all, the lining side has a smooth surface instead of sheepskin.  And they're way lighter duty than my Vt. Castings ones.  So I was holding all that against them too.  At first.Well, I gotta say, I'm starting to really like these gloves!  No, you would not want to pick up a burning log with them, nor do I think you'd want to be dragged behind a car balancing the weight of your body on your hands. But with anywhere near normal wood stove/fireplace task use, I can't imagine how you'd get holes in them.  As for heat, one of my wood stoves has a steel damper control lever not brilliantly placed so the part you touch is super hot.  These work for that extremely well.  I've also pulled open my wood stove's left door with them (that's very hot).  No problem.  And I don't think I'd hesitate to remove a cast iron skillet out of the oven wearing them either, in fact I'm seeing pretty good kitchen glove potential because I do cook and bake with iron.  Just to test them though in that regard, my wood stove is currently at 450 degrees so I put my gloved hand on the top of it.  Sure enough, I was starting to feel heat after about 10 seconds.  But I just don't stand around leaning on my 450-degree wood stove.  I mean, why would you need longer than that to be holding your wood stove?What I'm really starting to like about them is what others don't.  They're not super thick.  Super thick means super stiff and no end clumbsy.  These are thick enough to be reasonably heat-protective but they're starting to conform to my hands and finger bend points even though they're typically big on me which I find terrific for handling firewood that has  splinters waiting to happen.If they started getting holes ""from normal use"" then I'll come back and update.  But I'm getting rather fond of these more flexible but still quite sturdy and plenty thick enough fireplace gloves.  (Do note I'm not calling them welding gloves.  That's because I don't see that word in their description, so for the people who are trying to bend them into welding glove expectations, I don't think it's a good idea.  And for those who say they picked up a piece of cast iron out of their ovens and could only hold it for 30-45 seconds... well, I can't speak to that.  I usually take mine out of the oven and set it on a cold burner or trivet.So conclusion?  I think they're really nice for handling splintery wood, for a reasonable length holding of pretty hot metal, and that the trade off of not getting to hold a 450-degree piece of iron for a fairly long time is that they quickly start conforming to your hands' bending points.  How thick?  They'd break any needle on my sewing machine and would not even come close to fitting under the feeder foot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5IFZH7NO3BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GRGF60#wasThisHelpful","R1E5IFZH7NO3BS","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first fabric shaver and I got it specifically for my own handknit sweaters, shawls, socks and other VERY ""time-expensive"" things that I knit. Now add that my yarns are far from cheap. In other words, I consider my hand knits to be a huge investment.The first time I used this shaver I had no problems but was cautious because of reviews that reported it creating holes.  I made a mental note to remain cautious but it seemed safe to me.  I just used it again on a sock (34,000 itty bitty stitches = 2+ weeks) and it felt a bit iffy, like it could snag and pull.  This is a harsher yarn with closer halo, so I barely touched the fabric, nervous the whole time.I stopped and took the thing apart.  Okay, do that so you can understand how this works (about the same as any shaver is going to work).  When you unscrew the cover with the holes, be VERY cautious because the blade wheel is right underneath it and it's meant to fall out.  Take it out, but put it on a towel, face down, out of the reach of people or animals. Handle carefully but examine it.  Those blades are mounted with flexibility, meaning they can rise closer to the holes or fall away from the holes.  Just note that.  Now slide off the lint door (dark one on the front of the unit - batteries are the other door).  See where and how the lint goes from blade area into that lint trap.  Mine had a TON of fuzz.  I removed it all, and blew it out with compressed air.  Also blew out the blade wheel.  Replaced door, replaced blade wheel and its cover, and shaved my fabric again.  Whoa!  Now it was a whole different world.  Whereas before I barely touched the fabric for fear it would snag, now I was able to press the face plate (holes) right onto the fabric.  And it did a GREAT job of shaving the halo and halo balls (a/k/a pilling).I'd still be careful with ANY fabric shaver, but I'm just saying the difference in my perceived danger of snagging with fuzz in the unit and no fuzz in the unit -- it was a dramatic difference.  If doing a whole sweater, I'd be cleaning it out, guessing 6 times or more, depending on the yarn's halo.  Being a spinner of yarns from raw fleeces also, I can tell you that wool fibers are strong AND fine.  Some have a staple length of several inches on up (longhair sheep = 7-8"" fiber length).  The shaver cuts the fibers which is what you want.  But if those blades are forced outward (toward the guard plate with the holes) due to a wad of fuzz dust pushing it outward, those blades could pull rather than cut.I just love this little shaver, but having taken the thing apart completely and having seen how all this seems to work (key thing, that the blades are not frozen into their mount but can rise and sink), I just wanted to chime in with that info.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT1LIFYCVYTDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009ET7F6#wasThisHelpful","RT1LIFYCVYTDM","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer, I've only had it a day so will update if anything changes, but I bought this set for my second phone line, replacing a Uniden (whose proprietary and expensive handset batteries didn't last) so I'm familiar with Panasonic cordless.  These batteries are replaceable anywhere.This new set announces caller ID from the handset speakers, not the base, which is a HUGE advantage because the base can be in another room where you can't hear it anyway.  I haven't even cracked the manual but the answering machine and other functions are user friendly and intuitive.  Call blocking (which I have yet to read about) is a bonus.  The base itself has a surprisingly small footprint and can be hung on the wall.  Sound quality is excellent, volume control can be changed without interruptions or hassle (the up button on the center 4-way of each handset) and I couldn't be happier with it.My other Panasonic (same handsets except the new one has a sleek looking silver strip) gives me GREAT battery life between charges, and I expect this one will be the same -- can't ask for better than that.Another bigtime winner from Panasonic.  Not in love with their TVs' sound, but they make outstanding phones.I also bought their basic model headset (KX-TCA60). Never had a headset before.  OMG, died and gone to heaven?!  The other party can't tell you're using anything but the handset, its little mic can be offset below chin level so you can drink coffee without interference, walk around the house (handset in your pocket, cord attaching the two), make coffee, knit... completely hands free, great reception, fits comfortably and securely and doesn't hurt, in fact I forgot I had it on, and that little suckah will pay for itself in convenience.  It actually already has.  It has a clip on the cord if you want to secure it to your clothing or whatever.  Mine has to be pushed into the handset securely and not wiggled a lot or I get a blip of staticky ""connect me better"" sound, but that's not a big deal, I just see that it is.Very, very happy with this phone.  I'll update this if there's anything to pick apart on it as time goes on but it's just a little sweetheart at a really fair price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RT6NKY1IOSCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036D1SF4#wasThisHelpful","R3RT6NKY1IOSCW","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Meh.  Okay, they're good for cookie sheets and would also seem ideal for when a cloth hot pad would flop into the sauce.  (Keyword ""seem."")  The problem is that these are super slippery if even a drop of sauce or grease gets on the inside and it tends to, really easily.  The traction ridges on the inside just aren't enough to override how slippery the silicone material itself gets, and the material is stiff so there's not enough grip.  I really wanted to love these because of their size, but after using them a couple of times, I just kept feeling that they were a dropped casserole waiting to happen, with hot gooey contents clinging to my leg, foot, or ten times worse, atop a child passing by.

"I LOVE this little cooker!  I've been using it daily since it arrived and I've even taken it for a car ride (that handy elasticized keeper is unbelievably handy if it tilts).  I can't say enough great things about it, including that it holds more than you'd think and that the oval shape on this size cooker is a HUGE advantage.  And in today's world of crappy quality and ill-conceived design, it's surprisingly excellent on both counts.First, info I couldn't find online anywhere (and if you have a camper or boat, this is particularly a good unit for you)...INTERIOR DIMENSIONS:Measured at the (oval) crock's floor, it's 6"" long at longest point x 4.5"" wide at widest point x 3.25"" tall from floor to inside of rim (max useable cooking height).EXTERIOR (FOOTPRINT):At the widest/longest points, approx. 8.25"" long x 7"" wide x 7"" tall.  This does not include handles or slightly domed lid.  ***FOR THOSE WITH A BOAT OR CAMPER***This shape fits into smaller, tighter spaces AND (mwaaa-hahaha) that little elasticized lid securing device which is included for travel?  It would be great for your kind of storage options because stuff gets wedged in and this is a glass lid and it isn't even possible to slide or get bumped off with that elastic thing in place.)OTHERWISE:- No power light (few this size have them) which is the ONLY thing I can criticize.- Knob dial feels solid and seats well onto the settings (warm, low and high) without floppy play, and not tinny feeling.- Cord is substantial in heft (does not scare you in other words) but short (24"" from unit to prongs).- Plastic molded feet can slide on counter but most can and they're not particularly slippery.  You COULD add self-stick rubber feet, small ones.- Glass lid has stay-cool knob handle and it sits on a black rubber gasket around rim (the only one I've seen that has this), and creates a gap-free fit as it heats up.  But there are also 3 very thoughtfully designed groved indents in the crock's rim, and though condesation happens on any crockpot's lid, the gasket and groove combo prevents unexpected hot drips when you remove the lid.- Carry handles (on the base unit) are solid feeling and stick out farther than the crock insert's handles so you're less inclined to grab just the crock insert if moving it.  And you don't need mitts.- Elasticized keeper that's thoughtfully included for transport ALSO fits securely into a groove on the underside of the base's handles which keeps it off hot exterior and keeps it from slipping around (or off).  This thing was well designed.CAPACITY:Holds a solid 6 cups with a teense to spare before the rim.  In other words, pushing it, you do get a ""useable"" 6 cups cookable contents.  (My round 1.5-qt. holds less so ""useable"" volume is more like 5.5 cups, maybe a tad less, and the 2-qt. Rival that I'm returning has a full 1.5"" of the crock that sticks up above the base unit, making it absolutely unuseable space, thereby a larger unit that STILL really only has 1.5-qt. useable cooking volume.)TEMPERATURES:Definitely seem right on target, as I've made these recipes before in another crockpot.  High WILL get you a simmering bubble but not an outright boil.  Low seems to be just a smidge below the simmering point, as it should be.OVAL SHAPE:This is my first oval crockpot and I did NOT expect to find oval on a little one.  I am now sold on oval shape.  You can fit a larger single item or 2 smaller ones side by side on the floor of it, there's more stirring and contents movement room.  As for storage, again I'll say, the oval shape is not only easier to fit into narrower places, but more ergonomically friendly to slide in and out of places.HINT:  If you want to peek but not lift the lid on any glass or clear plastic crockpot lid (which extends your cooking time by 15 min.), all crockpots form condensation on the lid, clouding it so you can't see much detail through the clouding.  Rather than lifting the lid, give it a firm, quick jiggle (in place).  Somewhere on the lid, the condensation will form into a droplet and slide down, making for a see-through place.  If not good lighting, use a little flashlight and you will get a really good view of the contents without letting any heat out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RHQ8L9PKJDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K7VL8A#wasThisHelpful","R35RHQ8L9PKJDI","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In my humble opinion, it's a good size for two people -- sometimes with leftovers, sometimes not depending on what you're cooking.  If you are 2 and want a fair bit of leftovers OR want the flexibility to make a main course for 3-4 people, the same unit comes in 3-qt. but I'm not sure if it includes the lid keeper band or not.EXTERIOR (FOOTPRINT):At the widest/longest points, approx. 8.25"" long x 7"" wide x 7"" tall.  This does not include handles or slightly domed lid.  ***FOR THOSE WITH A BOAT OR CAMPER***This oval shape fits into smaller, tighter spaces AND (mwaaa-hahaha) that little elasticized lid securing band would be great for your kind of storage options where stuff gets wedged in, and ideally not always upright.  It holds the glass lid in place firmly, no slip-slide.OTHERWISE:- No power light (few this size have them) which is the ONLY thing I can criticize.- Knob dial feels solid and seats well onto the settings (warm, low and high) without floppy play, and not tinny feeling.- Cord is substantial in heft (does not scare you in other words) but short--24"" from unit to prongs.- Plastic bubble-molded feet can slide on counter as most can but they're not particularly slippery.- Glass lid has stay-cool knob handle and it sits on a black rubber gasket around rim (the only one I've seen that has this), and creates a gap-free, snug fit as it heats up.  There are also 3 very thoughtfully designed groved indents in the crock's rim, and though condesation happens on any crockpot's lid, the gasket and groove combo prevents unexpected hot drips when you remove the lid.- Carry handles (on the base unit) are solid feeling and stick out farther than the crock insert's handles so you're less inclined to grab just the crock insert if moving it.  And you don't need mitts.- Elasticized keeper band that's thoughtfully included for transport ALSO fits securely into a groove on the underside of the base's handles which keeps band off hot exterior and keeps it from slipping around, or off.  This thing was well designed.TEMPERATURES:Definitely seem right on target, as I've made these recipes before in another crockpot.  High WILL get you a good simmering bubbling but not an outright boil.  Low seems to be at or just a smidge below the simmering point, as it should be.OVAL SHAPE:This is my first oval crockpot and I did NOT expect to find oval on a little one.  I am now sold on oval shape.  You can fit a larger single item or 2 smaller ones (e.g., stuffed peppers) side by side on the floor of it and with oval, there's more stirring room.  As for storage, again I'll say, the oval shape is not only easier to fit into narrower places, but more ergonomically friendly for sliding it in and out of storage places.HINT:  If you want to peek but not lift the lid on any glass or clear plastic crockpot lid (which extends your cooking time by 15-20 min.), all crockpots form condensation on the lid, clouding it so you can't see much detail through the clouding.  Rather than lifting the lid, give it a firm, quick jiggle (in place).  Somewhere on the lid, the condensation will form into a droplet and slide down, making for a see-through place.  If not good lighting, use a little flashlight and you will get a really good view of the contents without letting any heat out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAB22FVQ1C7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K7XI1I#wasThisHelpful","R1SAB22FVQ1C7E","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm an avid coffee drinker.  And after 15+ years of the highly-convenient drip Bunn (which I've sworn by specifically because it keeps a reservoir of water hot all the time so coffee's done in 3 minutes), I stumbled upon a thumbnail of the Presto Electric Percolator which I'd originally come to think of as old fashioned and outdated in convenience.  But it's what I grew up with.  LOTS of reviews.  And almost all of them, stellar.  The ones that got to me though were ""full bodied"" and especially ""smell the coffee.""  And then there were mentions that it keeps the coffee perfectly hot and a long, long time before it starts to taste burnt.I ordered one, and it truly feels like I've come back home.  The taste is a WORLD better.  The smell of coffee fills the house.  It's way more hassle than the Bunn (filter discussion follows) but it's just sooo worth it.  And it takes a lot less counterspace.  I am back in coffee lover's heaven.FILTERS:  I never used them when I had a percolator before (isn't the basket the filter?) but I've read a number of reasons why they're a good idea, and I made a pot without, and a pot with.  I liked with.  Taste and also cleanup, and then the nagging thing about whatever it filters out which I don't recall, but google it if you have concerns.The square filters (sample pack comes in the box) with the pre-punched holes are ridiculously expensive.  About 10 cents each which, in my case, would add up fast because I make 6-cup pots rather than 12's just because I like it freshly made.  But it so happens that the floor of the commonly-available unbleached, round basket filters fit PERFECTLY into the floor of the 12-cup basket.  And they go up the sides to right where this coffee pot's filter cover lands.  I mean, a perfect fit.  To cut the center hole, I take 5 or so filters at a time, and gently fold them in half, then in half again.  That gives you dead center.  (And if you fold carefully, you'll keep the convenient shape they come in.)  Just snip off the teensiest corner--like about 1/16th of an inch because it will quadruple in size when unfolded.  After a couple of times, you'll get the hang of curved snipping so it's a perfect fit over the basket's center post with no gaps.  (Yes, this is a TAD of extra hassle, but we've all gotten an awfully low threshold for what we consider hassle.)  These filters cost 01 cent vs. 10 cents each.The only claim Presto makes that I don't find true on mine is 1 minute per cup.  Mine took 8 minutes for 2 cups and it takes 8 minutes for 6 cups.  Pfffft.  Not an issue when the quality of the coffee is this outstanding, but I'm just mentioning it in case that's a biggie for someone reading this.So while Bunn has been a WONDERFUL company, with their 3-year warranty (whereupon they will totally replace your coffee pot at no charge if anything wears out), and they're one of the few companies where you can readily talk to a human, and one who speaks English, I have no choice but to convert.Now an Off Topic addition, and I don't work for Amazon - no affiliation, but this suggests you consider buying one accessory because I LOVE mine.  A long handled coffee scoop.  I bought the Norpro (there are others) but this little sucker is just wonderful.  2 Tbsp. exactly (one scooper per 2 cups) and I can get 1 tbsp. by tilting my coffee jar (contents level) and pushing this in halfway.  The edge comes out vertical, so it's pretty darned exact.  But I keep my coffee in a 1-qt. mason jar and the long handle goes all the way to the bottom (or if you buy your coffee in bags, same thing).  Solid stainless, really great feel with great heft and a hole at the end so you can hang it.  (Makes a great ladle also).  Just saying.  So here 'tis.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SSVGIY/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i00.  Note that packaging MAY say 1 Tbsp. but it's two, and says so on the back of the handle.  Short handled coffee measure are a pain after using one of these.I give this Presto 12-cup percolator the highest of ratings.  It makes great coffee and it keeps it at a perfect temperature.  It has a small footprint, a substantial enough cord (though not as solid a connector as they used to be before China makes everything but that's replaceable if need be).  It's just a really good, good cup of coffee.  Me very happy camper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27M8JBK09P9CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IV0Q#wasThisHelpful","R27M8JBK09P9CA","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, what I bought says Rival but the company on the side of it says ""Crockpot"" so I think it's the same thing, because when I typed in my model number, this is what came up.  The photo also looks exactly like mine, down to the nth degree.  So I'm proceeding with that in mind.  And since I'm expanding my crop of crocks to buy a 2nd one in this size, I'm including the info that I couldn't find:CROCK'S INTERIOR dimensions:4-1/2"" wide at the bottom, 5-1/2"" wide at the top, 3-1/2"" deep (which takes you to just a gnat's knee under where the lid sits, so figure 3.25"" deep).Tradeoff with this unit:  You don't have high/low/keep warm but this one has THE smallest footprint of any 1.5-qt. crockpot out there, and the base unit goes all the way to the top of the crock (almost) so you do get full use of the available interior.  (They say not to fill a crockpot to the rim but some foods expand, others shrink, so just use forethought because ones that shrink are fine).CORD is substantial and thick enough not to be scary, and 36"" long (good or bad depending on how you look at it).SURROUND HEATING ELEMENTS AND HOT SPOTS:  A hotter spot does exist on slow cookers, period.  A workaround is to put a tin foil ""liner"" section around the hot side which the food holds against the wall. (almost always it's the side opposite the controls but since this one has no controls, it's probably the side where plug is - has not been an issue for me, but just saying).  This hasn't been a problem for me, but if making oatmeal or whatever, you can also butter the sides of the crock which helps.ROCKING LID SYNDROME:  Yup, the lid (sometimes) will rock as it's cooking.  Not always.  It doesn't bother me.  Apparently some models have gaskets now, but they never have in the past and I've always thought that was on purpose.  (I'm still not sure a gasket for a tight fitting lid is a plus or a minus on a crockpot.)DESIGN:  Glass for the see through lid, plastic knob.  Straight sided, small footprint (7-1/2"" base, 8-3/4"" higher up because of crock's nobs).  Removeable crock (imperative!)COOKS FAST OR RUNS HOT??  Today's slow cookers ALL run a little hotter than the original 1970s pots, and for good reason.  Food safety.  Also many recipes (even on the older ones) overstate the cooking times.  Not all, but many.I have two little crockpots, this one and the Proctor Silex Oval 1.5-qt.  I prefer this one for smaller quantities (veggies, rice) simply because it has a smaller floor area and smaller footprint. Cute lil' thang.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JODVT5RI559N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WHZJ8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2JODVT5RI559N","A2L5I2MB73UJ3L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L5I2MB73UJ3L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At 18 years old, without motivation or direction, author Tania's highly adventuresome father gave her a choice upon her high school years drawing to a close - she could either go to college or take a 26-foot sailboat around the world.  By herself!  She had some writing talent so he thought the experience would give her no end of subject matter to launch a writing career, and though intimidated by the idea, she chose the boat.  And the commitment.  Tania is a really good writer.  There were so many times when these pages brought me right there with her, from the day she left New York filled with totally understandable fears until the end. We meet lots of people through her travels and get an idea of what such an experience would be like.  Though there are a lot of technical sailing/boat/navigation references as she runs into various scenarios, you don't need to know a thing about them to enjoy being taken along with her through storms, doldrums, mishaps and joys.

"There are so many ideas on managing clients and staff available in this series. As an editor for a technical journal, I think I'll extract a few for my column.I especially liked the episode where Draper threw out Jansen, a client who wanted to sell bikinis but not show skin. Don called them prudes and idiots! I wish more engineering firms understood that the client-firm relationship is very delicate: it requires patience and honesty on both sides. Many a time, I have wanted to fire the client; instead, we build the process and it was either a nightmare of corrections or a product that limped out the door.As drama, the series is excellent. Draper and company could have been my father and grandfather. These were tough men who didn't talk about their feelings, at least not in public. It was nobody's business.Season 4 starts up where Season 3 left off. The only Season that is a little iffy is Season 1, in which the actors were still exploring their roles. We saw the same thing in Breaking Bad and House. By Season 2 Mad Men had a clear message and direction.You should stack Mad Men in the shelf with Breaking Bad and House, MD and entertain yourself and your family for decades to come.If this review was helpful, add your vote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0CLM57HI67N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038M2AOG#wasThisHelpful","R1E0CLM57HI67N","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does not come with screws.I went with four #10 1-1/2"" (US standard) premium wood screws with washers for less rattling; #12 screws that would fit; I had #10s handy. If you mount on studs, then you will need a 1/4"" drill bit in about 1"" for the pilot. Use a stud finder you can trust and check the drill for sawdust. If it comes back with only drywall, then you're on to plan B.Plan B involves plastic anchors into dry wall. You will want the simple kind since they will support 67 lbs. each. Unless you're using the rack for mountain climbing, 67 lbs. will support all the pots and pans you can hang on the wall. Drill the hole size with 1/4"" pilot drill bit; there are different types of bits so makes sure you have a set of pilot bits. Make the hole level, i.e., perpendicular to the wall (right angle). drill one of the top ones first, then swing the rack out of the way and set the next anchors: set by drilling the 1/4"" pilot hole and gently pounding the anchor into the hole with a hammer. You have to set the anchors if its into dry wall before you set the screws! I used a level, a head lamp because the rack fits into a very tight space; the drill barely fit. Once you set the anchors, use an electric screw driver to drive the screws once you have the screws in a couple of turns.Check the level when you drill the holes for the anchors.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134K2DRGHZ7PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005CETP#wasThisHelpful","R134K2DRGHZ7PY","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can get some good advice from You Tube on how to cut properly. I followed the advice, used a no. 3 for the first cut and a number 2 for the final cut. It even does eyebrows --- use the comb without a clipper attachment. I left the top alone and only did the sides and back.

"I bought this Garmin to replace a faulty predecessor that reset itself constantly --- once or twice a trip in the beginning and finally a dozen times during a 15 mile trip.The performance is superior to its predecessor. The programming is easier but it has some gliches. For example, if you want to store a location in memory you have to use save home then change the name to suit. The Garmin still resets itself. It is unnerving to be driving down an unfamiliar highway and lose your map for a minute. I've missed several turns this way. I've learned to keep the Garmin charged initially to get me started. Another tip is to remember the details of the next turn so that I won't get lost if Garmin resets. I had the predecessor for almost 2 years.The reason I docked a star is because the nuvi 2597 frequently gets lost in the small town I work in: Marshfield, Wisconsin. It got me to the store I was headed for but not by the most efficient route. Then, when I found the route the Garmin decided we were lost: the infamous (?).On the trip here from Ohio the nuvi 2597 performed well. I think there were only two resets during the entire trip.Update: 8 30 15: the 2597 performs well except for a few flaws that have carried on from past models:1. The 2597 often misses the exit on highways because it is slow ---- if you listen to the advice a mile or two before you will get what your missing --- it's just unnerving to be told to turn when I can't because I'm passing the exit.2. Sometimes, it leads me to a place that doesn't exist. I update the GPS every few months.3. The voice actuation is awful. I have found it easiest to spell out the name but it still mis-interprets.

"I gave this book 5 stars because it is an excellent idea. However, to properly cover the world would take several volumes like the Durants did it with their epic series on history.  Will and Ariel Durant wrote a series on world history entitled “The Story of Civilization.” ''Rousseau and Revolution,'' a book in that series, won the Pulitzer Prize. “A People’s is not of this caliber.With that said, I will say that the book was enlightening. As with Zinn’s People’s History of the United States, Harman manages to unearth history not covered, or covered badly, by American textbooks on history. Harman pulls together certain facts on the fall of the Roman republic:“Slave labour led to the impoverishment of free labour ….”“Brunt relates how ‘the poor could not afford to marry and, if married, to raise children. Families were limited by abortion and infanticide, if not by contraception.’ Many children abandoned by poor parents would end up in the slave markets.’‘The leading families used their political control to increase their already substantial landholdings at the expense of the peasantry, pushing them into debt, taking their land and relying on the judges to find in favour of the Patricians.’Eventually, the Patricians, represented in the Senate, were forced to allow nomination of Tribunes to protect the Plebeians from the magistrates (judges) (who were in the hands of the Patricians.Two such tribunes, Tiberius Gracchus and his brother Gaius, who were too troublesome for the Senate ---- because they were active in their support of the poor --- were murdered by the Patricians. Eventually, this class warfare resolved itself by nomination of the Czar. The role of the Czar was to assure the power of Patricians who had begun to fight among themselves.In American history text books, the Gracchus brothers are described as transferrers of wealth. Definitely a capitalist perspective. I’m surprised they didn’t smear them in red by confusing communism with socialism.A good read, if you poke through a chapter at random, as I did.

"The argument Robert Reich puts forward is well-founded. French economist, Thomas Piketty, recently all but proved it based on French tax records dating back 150 years: economics melt down when the rich lock away money in capital gains. However, this book fails, as so many do, to deliver solid, workable ideas for dealing with the problems.One of Reich's ideas, ""higher marginal tax rates on the wealthy,"" is an excellent idea but ignores the barb wire, i.e., all the defensive protections banks and governments have conspired to create to help the rich hide there money. Let's start there, instead of introducing another tired plan of taxing the rich. I would suggest employing an NSA-type spy agency solely for collecting taxes from the rich.Another idea is the ""re-employment system rather than an unemployment system."" This is a grand idea but like so many ideas there is no detail on how this could work in a modern society.Another vague dream is the old re-training idea. I have a relative who worked in an automotive plant. He was trained to repair robots until even that job went away a few years later. Have you ever looked at what jobs are hot? The high school councilors nearly always get their information wrong or too late. For this to work, you need companies training people to do real jobs. That's how it works in Europe, especially in Germany.As I said, a good read until Reich gets to the nuts and bolts.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONONAU1A6D3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307592812#wasThisHelpful","RONONAU1A6D3G","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes a two-man job.First, the tools. It helps if you have metric sockets and a wrench, though you can substitute imperial sockets.Second, you will need spanners as well as sockets. These are required for a tight fit.Third, you will need to bore out some of the holes.Fourth, and most important: plan a trip to the store for some spare parts. During the assembly a nut and a carriage bolt were not tapped correctly and took significant effort to disassemble.Fifth, some components were faulty. The front strut, item G, was not bent correctly. I couldn’t get both G struts to fit with the 13 mm wrenches. Instead, I built one as shown in the instructions, anchored the second strut with a 13 mm bolt and nut and went to the hardware store for a -inch replacement: ¼-in. bolt, washer and lock nut (AKA stop nut) and 0.375-in. washer to mate up to the ¼-in. washer for support. The 1/4""-in. washer allowed me to attach the G strut and even bend it into place at the yoke (H part).Sixth, the C components are a little tricky. The drawing was deceptive: the orientation is opposite of as shown in the drawings. The flat side should face towards the rear axial so that the bolt hole above lines up correctly.Word to the wise, don’t tighten anything down until they tell you to in the instructions: every nut is a lock nut in project. If you get it wrong you will have to apply great force to disassemble. My approach is to put everything together in my hands to see how it fits, then test the tools to make sure I have the right sockets and such, then inspect the bolts and then finally do the assembly.Assembly consists of three challenging sections: 1) assembly of the front section of the chassis; 2) assembly of the rear section of the chassis; and 3) attachment of the bucket (called the tray) to the rear section of the chassis. The third section is the most challenging.This third section in the assembly requires two people. Worst still, you will want to duct-tape the rear axial assembly (E) to the rear frame (D) during the assembly of the rear section; the instructions seem overly concerned that you will misalign the rear frame and put it together backwards when its already stamped “Front” and “Back.” This third section, attachment of the bucket with 6-13 mm carriage bolts, requires that the bolts go through the tray to the rear frame. I had some hold the bucket up, put in the center bolt and I quickly screwed it down with a socket wrench while they held the carriage bolt in place with a screwdriver: do the middle front one first to hold the rear chassis to the bucket (tray). Then do the other two. During this part of the operation, one of the nuts failed; another trip to the hardware store provided sufficient spares, though I could only get hex head bolts. I chose 5/16-in. hex heads 1-1/2-in. long to substitute because the ones provided were a little shorter than I liked. After getting the first bolt in it was possible to do the work myself, alone.After this step, the assembly was all downhill.The cart is a little heavy for my mother, a 78-year old but it will carry the weight. Altogether, I spent 5-hours to assemble the cart.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JMSZAZA21TYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0C683K#wasThisHelpful","R2JMSZAZA21TYG","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Remember that PBS show from the 70’s, “Connections,” that is modus operandi for this book. Gavin Weightman writes about the real inventors, and often the real inventor(s) --- plural.Did you know that Robert Fulton did not invent the steamboat, nor did he invent a functional torpedo for the British navy or anything else? Robert Fulton is an example of a great idea man and promoter, which many of the inventors are who you will find in the history books.Did you know that Orville and Wilbur Wright, the inventors of the first workable air plane, were terrible businessmen? Their first airplane had a number of mechanical faults, which others like Glenn Curtiss eliminated. One such flaw was an aileron that was operated by twisting the wing the way a bird flies. Ailerons are the flaps at the back edge of an airplane. Glenn Curtiss invented the modern flap as a lever as seen in today’s aircraft. The Wright brothers sued Curtiss for patent infringement. In fact, rather than spending their time inventing better aircraft as Curtiss did, the brothers literally spent their last dime defending the patents on their old, faulty design.Getting back to the title about the inventor of the cotton gin, I’ll start in the beginning. Nathanael Greene invited Phineas Miller from Connecticut to teach his children in South Carolina. Phineas Miller helped Eli Whitney come south to tutor as well. Whitney and Miller worked in secret with others in New Haven. Somehow, the word got out, the planters found a way to copy their design and then set about to destroy their reputations. One such story spread by planters was that “Whitney’s deseeding gin tore the cotton. Needless to say Whitney wins only a historical reference; Miller got nothing.Difficult to follow at times for its twists and turns, this book is worth the time.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZZ4XODZTWTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802144845#wasThisHelpful","R26ZZ4XODZTWTX","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summary review:Pros:1. Goes where no vacuum has gone before.2. Extremely good HEPA filtration, far superior to most conventional vacuums on pet fur,dust, etc..3. Will untangle itself from most wiring and even traps under furniture.4. Will, with some difficulty, clean moderately thick shag rugs and carpet.Cons:1. Does not like loose throw rugs.2. Will still chew up tassles on rugs.3. Can find its way under furniture and become trapped: this happened twice ---- once with a couch and a second time with a lazy boy.I noticed no reluctance with dark carpeting and an ability to figure out how to unstick itself. It is best to de-Roomba the area first after running and watching the robot vacuum an area for 3-4 times. I used duct tape to put wires together so the Roomba could only push the bundle around without getting trapped in it. I stuck a board in under the lazy boy to keep it out of there. I also moved a chair away to allow the Roomba clear access to vacuum under a kitchen table while I am away. I have my mother running the Roomba once a week.Descriptive reviewI ran the Roomba through the downstairs and then took it upstairs where things are more challenging. Downstairs I have tile floor, thin carpet, a thick Persian rug in three rooms and a hallway. Right of the box, the Roomba darted for my office, which I thought was pecular. I let it work in there and then five minutes later it was in the hallway and then it zipped across to the kitchen/laundry room area. I was skeptical, at first, until I opened the dust bin. It was packed. Shortly after that it went back to the charger because it was operating with only partial charge: run time about an hour. I let it rest all night in its bat cave, i.e., a corner next to my futon/bed. The next morning, I let it run through its paces first thing in the morning; this time I used the virtual walls to focus only on the den where the futon is; otherwise, known as man-cave. After about a half hour I took it upstairs after emptying the bin. Previously, the night before I locked the Roomba in the office where it did a good job and avoided all the loose wires.I moved it upstairs; robots don't climb stair yet. It did the kitchen (tile + another Persian rug) and it seemed to need guidance. I used the remote control to drive it to one side of the kitchen that my mother wanted done more effectively and then I set the Roomba on ""spot"" so it cleaned more effectively. You can use the remote or the buttons on top of the Roomba. I had the virtual walls set up to block it into the kitchen.I wanted to see it run on shag so I directed the Roomba through my mother's office. It did fine but I could tell I was pushing it a bit. Through the office to the hard floors in the bedroom/bath hallway. I turned it loose in my mother's bedroom where it searched under the bed, just like my sisters would -- oh, looking for dust. It cleaned the whole room but tried to pull out the tassles in her rug.Next, we moved on to the living room with wood floors and a thin area rug. The Roomba did well until it got stuck under a couch and had to be pulled free. That's the only time it got stuck. It went straight back in and this time avoided getting stuck but did thoroughly clean under the couch. The living room was thoroughly clean of dust and cat hair in about an hour; the kitchen about 40 minutes. I took it downstairs to recharge. This house has about 1,000 feet upstairs --- the Roomba did about 75% of it, excluding most of the office and the second bedroom. It cleaned one narrow bathroom in about 5 minutes.Now, the bad news; the Roomba won't completely replace your vacuum: not enough power. Like the vacuum though, it also won't pick up pebble-sized clumps, anything wet, or oddly paper punch holes. These are impervious to vacuums everywhere.The Roomba, though it has many escape algorithms and figures out how to get away from small throw rugs, even those with tassles, don't expect these to get clean from a Roomba or even an ordinary vacuum. The Roomba also has trouble cleaning transitions say between a tile floor and carpeting. I found stuff behind that it couldn't get. It does transition well between the two, changing the vacuum mode but it's as though the debris an inch or so away from the transition is in a protective shadow.The Roomba is a great supplement to a vacuum and compliment. I've never had a vacuum go straight under a bed and clean every corner --- that's mechanically impossible. If you buy one of these, you will get more pet hair and dust out of your life but you will still have to vacuum periodically to get the big stuff. I am happy with it and plan to use it to supplement vacuuming every week or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37TZLE9GDHN03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GK3IVW#wasThisHelpful","R37TZLE9GDHN03","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent burner! I cooked a spaghetti meal on this burner in an hour. A stove would have taken a little less time but I have no room for one in my apartment. The only complaint is a burnt plastic smell from a coating on the burner. Hopefully, this will disappear after a few more days.I use the burner periodically when I am home from business trips. So far, after using the burner approximately 20 times over the past 8 months, I have found that the burner performs well. The plastic smell went away after about half a dozen uses. Seldom do I use the 5 setting. For eggs, 1 is sufficient. For preparation of a casserole a 2-3 is sufficient.This burner sits on an insulated thermal sheet (SS cover with insulation sandwiched between.) on top of my microwave, which is on a cart. This is a very compact kitchen arrangement that works well for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160QGLI2GGT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I14C7I#wasThisHelpful","R160QGLI2GGT4","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best all-in-one I ever owned!As a long-term HP fan I’ve lived with the idea that printers and scanners are only supposed to last a year or so: I was wrong. I bought an Epson 3540 to replace an HP all-in-one that lasted less than a year and simply wasn’t up to the task at hand. I was scanning pages of my library to reduce it to accessible PDFs. I am a consulting engineer so knowledge at my fingertips is appealing. The Epson cut through thousands of old articles, engineering notes, memos, brochures, calculations. I literally filled two carefully-packed leaf bags five feet high. The Epson is a little worn out but still functional.Pros:*  Fast printing;*  Clear scanned images --- PDF, JPG --- better than HP;*  Easy set-up;*  Easy, flexible software;Cons:*  Works better wired than wireless --- HP has the same problem (last 3 all-in-ones)*  Scanned images through feeder are often not straight --- take care to align side guides or use the document table for hand feeding;*  Scanner won’t feed heavy card stock --- don’t use the feeder for the HP at all.All-in-all, the Epson 8540 is the best choice in its category.Please add your vote if this was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9Y5MY86WEZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091DPYDU#wasThisHelpful","R1O9Y5MY86WEZ2","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this biography. I do agree with other reviewers that this is less an in-depths study of the life of a man than a caricature. Nobody could kill as many animals in as short a time as Meinertzhagen or be able to identify them all so successfully - this was clearly bragging.As for his military exploits, these are more believable. There are individuals in combat that live a charmed life; look at Major Richard Winters, 101st airborne.I have less faith in the stories where Meinertzhagen told off general so-and-so. A major or captain just doesn't do that, despite his admirable military acumen. This is probably bragging.My main complaint about this book is that it is written by a South African. There is a language barrier in translating from Afrikaner to English. This means re-reading a paragraph to isolate its meaning.Obviously, this book suffers from its over-dependence on Meinertzhagen's own diaries and other information.If this review is useful, please add your vote.________________________________SECOND THOUGHTS:Capshaw says the East African witch doctor lured Meinertzhagen to a meeting and set a trap to kill him. Meinertzhagen figured it out from his past dealings with the guy and from what his spies told him. Meinertzhagen set his own trap. A scottish commissioner, who Meinertzhagen secretly dispised, was the proponent behind the 3 court marshals.(Then, why did Meinertzhagen hunt with the guy?) The commissioner claims Meinertzhagen killed the witch doctor in cold blooded murder; it's war --- it's called killing! I doubt if Meinertzhagen would have survived if he hadn't set the trap because Europeans were grossly outnumbered in these colonial encounters. His survival is his proof of the success of his methods.Capshaw takes too much delight with what happened later to the commissioner who was kicked out of East Africa shortly after Meinertzhagen. He is too close to his subject for objectivity.It was typical, though of the Victorian army to get rid of the troublemakers and the person who made all the noise to get rid of him; thereby leaving no fight from friends of either.Capshaw later describes how Meinertzhagen tried to advise the sequence of British commanders who tried to fight the better trained and better soldiers occuppying German East Africa. The Wikapedia writer says the work Meinertzhagen was a miss but how could Meinertzhagen have survived the witch doctor encounter and mapped much of the territory in German East Africa under the noses of the Germans without having the spy network Capshaw claims he had.Capshaw is obviously suffering from Stockhold syndrome. He believes too much of Meinertzhagen, a man he clearly admires though much of what Meinertzhagen writes is either pure fiction, self-agrandizement or self-serving. As a man, T H Lawrence may have Meinertzhagen just about right: a tough, curious, adventurer, a bold-face lier, a self-serving sociopath, a violent bully, an ultimate ego, a conniving spy, and a brave soldier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7Y08XAW2ANR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312182716#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7Y08XAW2ANR","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My mother, a Trowbridge of the Caleb Trowbridge branch, found this book somewhat insular. She said it was written about a branch she had not heard of in Arkansas. The bulk of the text is poor, with many mimeo-graphed letters that are difficult to read. She found the first 70-80 pages interesting; it collaborated her studies of the clan. These pages discuss the Trowbridges back in England. It seems that charity has always been at the heart of the clan.

"Given the title you might think that I disapprove of this book -- wrong!Although I would find Hallinan's book more interesting if he delved into subjects like the Monty Hall paradox this book catches my attention with its overall theme: we make mistakes because we don't understand our weaknesses. Given our lousy attention span, perhaps this book offers just enough detail.Here's some interesting conclusions I reached after reading this book:1. Over-confidence is our leading root cause for error.We think we are smarter than anyone else. We think we do things better with practice. Although men fearlessly tinker and solve problems they still can't follow directions worth a damn. Women, on the other hand are afraid they'll screw up something so under-confidence is an issue they own but that is really over-confidence, in a way; you can't get confidence if you won't risk confidence so you avoid risk  --- that's confidence hoarding.2. We remember stories best.We can more easily remember if a guy is a baker than that his last name is Baker.3. We can't chew gum and walk at the same time.Focusing on more than 3 things at a time gets most of us in trouble. If you're driving it's probably only 2 things.Read this book. It will make you take a conscious look at your liabilities and, to use a term in the book, ""re-calibrate"" your over-confidence. You'll definitely be self-conscious when you text while driving again.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUT6UAT1EIQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767928067#wasThisHelpful","RIUT6UAT1EIQX","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The lamp is not as bright as a halide but you won't need protection from infra-red, the fixture won't burn out in 6-months, and the lamp is cool.The only negative is the neck is very stiff.

"I just received the cooler this afternoon. It was the high 90's outside. This cooler replaces a noisy Targus cooler with two, unmovable 3-in. fans. The Targus is getting old and will break soon so I decided to replace it.The most appealing thing about the Cooler Max is the adjustable fans, the second is the three 3-in. fans. The manufacturer evidentally determined that a laptop is hottest at the battery and the CPU. This makes sense.With the fans located in a Y pattern favoring the left side of the keyboard I measured the best results. I experimented several times to get the optimum cooling.I added a crossflow fan and that seems to keep the temperatures below 105 F in the upper left corner near the on switch of my HP Pavilion dv7. I measured the temperature with an IR gun I used for work: +/-2 F. Without the crossflow (acros the keyboards), and without the fans running at maximum, the CPU box is about 127 F.This is probably the best cooler out there although I've heard the military has better, liquid-cooled systems.

"I showed this movie to a girlfriend who is a devout Catholic. She was fascinated and mortified at the same time. Agora is story of the great Hypatia of Alexandria. Hypatia may have hypothesized elliptical orbits 1400 years before Johannes Kepler.My girlfriend had several nights of questioning her religious conviction. She told me later that she hated me for forcing her to doubt but later appreciated the movie because, it is thought-provoking.Christianity was a religious upstart in the 5th century. Imagine the religious zealots of our day: the end justifies the mean; Machiavelli never said a more crystalline clear phrase.

"I bought this belt clip because I fear my C-clip will tear the belt strap on my pats. I like C-clips because I can thin out my keys and add other things I need like a compass. Compasses are useful in drawing maps and making your way in huge industrial complexes, like refineries.The belt clip requires that you loop your belt through it; this is good because otherwise you'd run the risk of losing the clip and the C. The belt clip is sufficient to fit most belts. I measured 2-1/8th inches, which works even for some of my broad belts.

"Although the situation in the Weimar republic was different than ours there are similarities. That's why you should read this book.The Kaiser's Germany paid for WWI on credit. France, England, and America raised taxes. This lesson seems to have been lost on the Republicans.While France had a legitimate cause for reparations - the war was fought in France's industrial sector - they went too far. France demanded revenge for a war in which all parties were to blame.But, reparations were only part of the reason for the collapse of the Weimar republic and the rise of the NAZIs. After the war, and during the 1920fs, the socialist Weimar republic struggled to get the war profiteers and industrialists to pay their fair share. Instead, the conservatives hid their money abroad and paid to support what eventually became the Nationalist Socialists, or NAZIs.How does this less experience relate to our own in 2011? We, too, have rich industrialist (corporations) who hide their profits and support right-wing groups, like the Tea Party, who brainlessly fight against taxes for the rich, regulations on corporations and nationalism. Does this sound familiar? I hope it turns out better for us than it did for the Germans.In the end, after the faultering of numerous PhD's in economics who served as the head of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht took over. Schacht had been serving as the currency commissioner when he suggested just killing off the old mark. In its place, he installed the Rentenmark, which was backed by all of land, property and industrial capacity of Germany. Speculation in currency was strictly regulated, something that Schacht's predicessors began after the Austrian model. This is how Germany ended its hyperinflation and deflation. The deflation continued but the inflation stabilized. The lesson to be learned here is that the industrious capacity of a people is the true asset upon which paper money is based.Dropping the old mark for the new ruined many speculators, investors and pensioners. Banks too it on the head. Perhaps this is the solution to our current worldwide problem --- let the bankers take it on the head.This is an excellent read with many new biographical excerpts that seemed to be missing when I studied 20th century history.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UPK7YPL6EG1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586489941#wasThisHelpful","R1UPK7YPL6EG1F","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this case you will find the best protection for your blackberry. These guys really learned from theirs and others mistakes.Case protection is in 3 layers. First, there is the hard rubber case. Second, the heavy plastic over the LCD screen; there was a key pad protector but I broke it easily while trying to install it --- that's a minor problem I will discuss later. Third, the rubber case stretches over a solid hard plastic shell. It has its own skeleton; a soft fleshy exterior with a hard interior that even protects the screen with a horizontal cross brass; the keypad is protected by a sloped, raised wall. This is a superior case, far better than the single heavy rubber case offered by OtterBox's competitors.The only difficulty, as alluded to above, is that it takes about 10 minutes of struggling to get the case around the blackberry and then the rubber case around the plastic case. Boy, is it worth it. My Incipio case with the single heavy rubber case allowed my blackberry to survive being run over by a car but the LCD screen did not survive. It was cracked and the keyboard was damaged. I bet the OtterBox would survive because of the raised support and heavy see-through plastic cover over the screen. The holster is not as well-conceived.The holster suffers from two minor flaws: The belt clip does not appear to be sturdy and the force required to remove the blackberry from the holster is sometimes enough to rip the clip from a belt. It's happened twice. The trick seems to be to pry the blackberry from the two opposing plastic pads holding it into the holster.Holsters are always tricky. I've gone through two Incipio cases in 18 months. The clip rusted in the first one and froze. I pulled too hard and snapped the plastic. In the second, Incipio protected the clip spring with plastic but it broke too only lasting a few more months. I think the clip and spring is the Achilles heal of this type of product.So, here's what you do with the OtterBox. I worked it out with a little practice. Push with your pinky and ring finger while pulling with your index finger. The encased blackberry pops easily out of the holster without risking pulling the holster off a belt. With a little practice you can do this easily.With that said, the holster has some pluses over Incipio: it won't spring out unexpectedly. The base is built into the holster not the rubber case like Incipio so it won't either fall out or allow the blackberry to fall out --- that's how I lost my 1st blackberry to a car; it fell out while I was running with a walkman.This is an outstanding product and I plan to use it for many years. I recommend it for police, firemen, engineers and other people who go into rough situations where they don't want to worry about their phone. It's not a pretty case though but it is very macho.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.PS, 3 weeks later.The holster lasted less than 3 weeks. The holsters seems to be a fatal flaw with the incipio and the Otterbox. The spring on the incipio corroded to failure in 4-6 months. The clip holding the sides of Otterbox showed scoring and the base of the clip showed mechanical stress, i.e., lightening of the black to a gray. Finally, the top clip, a round socket, snapped and the holster failed.I've given up on the holsters. These case-holsters are too expensive to keep replacing. Instead, I opted for a camera case. I found a Lowerpro model Volta 20 with a zipper that barely holds the Ottercase. The Volta straps to a belt with enough room to wear it comfortably. And, the Volta provides an additional shell.Dirk WillardPost script:  months later I bought another defender case for a 9700. The holster clip survived. Later, the 9700 blackberry failed and I replaced it with a defender case for a 9900 blackberry. The 9900 clip lasted 6 months before it failed. The second defender case for the 9900 is on its 3rd month. The locking strip that keeps the clip open for ease of putting it on a belt snapped off, as they all do, within a few months. So, Otter Box has made some improvements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1O01IC2PBJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033Z5W5C#wasThisHelpful","R3N1O01IC2PBJ9","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought one Homebright, screwed it to a plaque and nailed that to a board. I positioned it in the garden to scare away deer and rabbits. Since installing it a week ago, the deer avoid the area around the sensor. It emits a human voice announcing, ""Warning, you have entered a restricted area,"" in a loud, authoritarian voice. My girl friend was startled once when she was working too late in the garden (after dark). I told her, imagine how the deer feel when a loud human voice yells at them while flashing blue lights and a squeel are emitted. I don't know if you'd want that going off at 2 am in your backyard but in a garden in the middle of no where it's great! I bought 3 more.Setting up the Homebright is a little difficult. Push the weather-proof button on the left to turn it on. You may need to leave it in the sun for a half hour to charge the battery right out of the box. Next, push the button on the right  and move it about until it senses something. When the Homebright goes off, you'll know it's set for the evening. The sensor only works after dark so it won't annoy you during the day, only after sunset.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131GJ80TIX8LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UO801E#wasThisHelpful","R131GJ80TIX8LB","A38DSYHNBYZNUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38DSYHNBYZNUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, received thousands, if not tens of thousands of pleas for help in solving unsolved crimes, righting wrongs, and setting justice right. The pleas came from all over the world, from people who believed he could help. Often the pleas were written directly to Sherlock Holmes – a testament to the power that a fictional character could hold over the imagination.Grieving for his recently deceased wife, grieving more for the guilt he carried for having been in love with another woman for the decade leading to his wife’s death (she suffered from consumption or tuberculosis), he opens the mail one morning to find a plea from a man named George Edjali, a barrister, born in England of a Parsee father (native of Bombay) and a Scottish mother. Edjali had been arrested, tried and convicted of mutilating horses and cows in rural Staffordshire, where his father was an Anglican vicar.Doyle immediately sees the miscarriage of justice. Perhaps because of the guilt he was carrying, perhaps because of the need to break away from the depression he has experiencing, perhaps because of the outrage he felt at what had happened to Edjali, Doyle does not give the letter to his secretary to send a polite dismissal. He accepts the request. And because he does, British justice will ultimately change.This is a true story. In 2006, novelist, essayist, translator and art critic Julian Barnes wrote a phenomenally well-researched novel of what happened, entitled “Arthur & George.” Earlier this year, ITV broadcast a three-part series in Britain based on the book, staring Martin Clunes (“Doc Martin”) as Doyle and Arsher Ali as George. The series recently aired in the U.S. as well.The book is a wonder. And it’s also a wonder that the TV series could extract the story it did from the novel.Barnes tells the stories of the two men from childhood forward, because so much of what their entwined story becomes originated in their childhoods. And he tells it in the present tense, which adds an immediacy and a dramatic effect to the narrative. He gets inside the heads of both of his leading characters, something a television program couldn’t succeed as well as doing and so didn’t try. But the program does succeed at telling the story, focusing on the mystery of what actually happened.Edjali, the barrister, has an almost childlike faith in British justice, a faith that survives his arrest and imprisonment experience, but just barely. Doyle, the writer whose involvement would lead rather quickly to a review and investigation by the British Home Office, is less taken with British justice, and fully understands how it could go off the rails, with biased police investigators desperate to find the culprit and an incompetent trial judge. (Because of this case, Britain would create a court of appeals.)Barnes has written numerous novels, collections of essays and short stories, and art criticism. He received the Man Booker Prize in 2011 for his novel “The Sense of an Ending,” only one of his many prizes and recognitionsWhat is clear from Barnes’ account of Doyle and Edjali is that Doyle needed Edjali as much as Edjali needed Doyle. They would not become lifelong friends, although Doyle did invite him to the wedding to his second wife. But their need of each other at the coinciding time of their lives was mutual and, ultimately, beneficial.The story of “Arthur & George” is fascinating. How Julian Barnes tells that story is equally fascinating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FIT49X3R46N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKPQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1FIT49X3R46N5","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in an age of brittle celebrity. You can become famous for, well, being famous. Some of the most popular shows on television are aimed at catapulting unknowns into stardom, and while these shows may be about the people we see on the stage, we know it’s really about us. You don’t publish a book, a play or a song without a pre-existing platform, and in the circular reasoning of book publishing, you gain a platform by first being famous. And what is the evolution of prayer books and rosary beads to smart phones if nothing else but a search for personal meaning? We have all become journalists and photographers and our subjects are ourselves.The Christian community is marginally in a better place but not immune, although one could argue we should be. Mega-church pastors become Christian celebrities; some Christian authors sell books simply by putting their names on the covers. And we buy and consume according to Christian fads, trends and what’s hot at the moment, much like our secular cohorts do. And perhaps we wonder if only Christian celebrities are the ones who can accomplish the big things for God.And then comes along a book, a small book, a book about the small things, the little things, the small steps, the people whose names will never be plastered across a mega-church marquee, a book that says what we Christians know to be true: it’s not about who you are, or how big your following, or how big your platform, or how recognizable your name is in George Barna’s polls. It’s about your willingness to serve right where you are, because God doesn’t care how famous you are.“Most of us will make a difference in this world,” writes Deidra Riggs in “Every Little Thing: Making a World of Difference Right Where You Are,” “but not because of some grand or large-scale initiative. No, most of us will change our corner of the world and make an impact that stands the test of time through the small and seemingly insignificant (to us) interactions and decisions and conversations of our average days. We make a difference where we live, and incrementally, that place begins to shift (emphasis added).”The lady knows of what she speaks. She writes from life experiences – jumping from an airplane, the chopping down of a beloved cherry tree, fear of the water (as in ocean), moving from a comfortable Philadelphia suburb to what looks like the end of the earth (flyover country, aka Nebraska), a baby daughter rushed to the hospital. She ties each life experience to Scripture, and she does it in a conversational way, a real way, like you’re sitting with her at the kitchen table and she is telling you her story and it turns out to be your story at the same time.Riggs is a writer and editor, and she’s also the wife of a pastor. That move to Nebraska? Her husband accepted a position at a church in Lincoln. Initially, things didn’t go well, whether it was the mice in the pantry or parishioners leaving the church with no explanation. She will tell you, and she does: she was miserable, and kept questioning herself, her husband, and God. Seven years passed before she reached the point she did when riding her bike one day: “This is good.” And she could see what God had seen – the difference she and her husband would be making.“Every Little Thing” is more than a good book. It’s something that even many Christian books aren’t: it is a true book. It is the experience and wisdom of one woman speaking our common language of the heart, our common language of faith.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZBWU9AJO7XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGPA4#wasThisHelpful","R1DZBWU9AJO7XZ","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s an invitation to engage with ordinary, simple, familiar things.A painting in an art museum. A young boy building a light-bulb circuit. A migraine headache. Searching for thimbleberries. Family rituals, like reading stories aloud. Cooking from a friend’s recipe. Reading a much-loved story from your childhood.It is in those simple familiar things that writer Monica Sharman finds beauty, and more than beauty. In the beauty of the ordinary she finds metaphors for Bible reading, and has collected those metaphors in “Behold the Beauty: An Invitation to Bible Reading.”Her invitation is as simple as the beauty she writes about: “Come with me. Come to that which our ears can hear, our eyes can see, and our hands touch. Extend your hands. Take hold of the Bible, the very words of God Himself.”This is not a call to excitement and thrills. This is a call to a deliberate, thoughtful walk, a walk with senses alert, yes, but a walk in the quiet things of the everyday. It’s an important call, because we spend most of our lives in the quiet things of the everyday.And it is there that is the best place to read the words of God.In addition to reading about God’s word, Sharman provides small anecdotes about herself and her family – a hike, a vacation by train, an over-stimulated baby, her own experiences with God at CalTech, where she majored in physics. Each anecdote is carefully woven into the fabric of the story she is telling. And Sharman is a storyteller, a storyteller who seems familiar because she is telling our stories as she tells her own. (Be sure to read the preface by writer Jean Fleming; she knows about Sharman and her storytelling abilities.)Each relatively short chapter includes practical, simple suggestions – what Scriptures to read, questions to ask (and answer), ideas to try out. She suggests paying special attention to how Scripture uses metaphors and repetition, how conversations develop, how details help tell the story, why the setting is so often so important, and other helpful practices.“Behold the Beauty” is written by a woman who loves God’s word and is eager to share that love in practical, familiar ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AEVZG5QNX92F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E2TE5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2AEVZG5QNX92F","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a global city, one of the world’s great cities, this place we call and know as London. It has given birth to empire and great literature, houses the oldest continuing monarchy, has created innovative office architecture (The Shard, the Gherkin and the Walkie-Talkie, to mention three) to decorate its skyline, and expresses itself as a contemporary metropolis while more than 2,000 years of history lie beneath it.It is only fitting that London should have a collection of poems devoted to it. Jane McMorland Hunter’s “Ode to London: Poems to Celebrate the City” is a small volume but with exactly the right poems to recognize and celebrate the city.McMorland is a writer and gardener, and works at Slightly Foxed Books on Gloucester Road in west London. She’s published three additional poetry anthologies: “First World War Poems,” “Favorite Poems of England,” and “Classic Readings & Poems: For Weddings, Christenings, Funerals and All Occasions,” in addition to several books on gardening.Published in 2012, “Ode to London” includes poems and writers familiar and unfamiliar, historical and contemporary, all of whom celebrate the city. The poems are not in chronological order but rather organized by six categories – its industry, shipping and the Thames, nature, architecture, seasons and people (McMorland gives each section more poetic titles).The poets include Lord Byron, John Dryden, Mary Robinson, William Blake, Rudyard Kipling, Wilfred Owen, Eleanor Farjeon, Robert Herrick, John Donne, Alfred Noyes, Carrie, Etter, T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, John Betjeman, A.A. Milne, and William Wordsworth. They write of summer mornings, arriving in London, the Great Fire (1666), the streets, riding a bus, the Thames and its bridges, the gardens and trees, the weather, Londoners, the statues of Buckingham Palace, and cats (in the case of T.S. Eliot).The book’s numerous illustrations are all taken from posters published over the years by Transport for London, the government agency that runs the city’s underground and bus systems. Many of the posters are available through the London Transport Museum.Here is one familiar poem from the collection:Composed Upon Westminster BridgeBy William WordsworthSeptember 3, 1802Written in the roof of a coach, on my way to FranceEarth has not anything to show more fair:Dull would he be of soul who could pass byA sight so touching in its majesty:This City now doth, like a garment, wearThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare,Ships, towers, domes, Theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the sky;All bright and glimmering in the smokeless air.Never did sun more beautifully steepIn his first splendor, valley, rock, or hill;Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!The river glideth at his own sweet will:Dear God! The very houses seem asleep;And all that mighty heart is lying still!“Ode to London” is a small, readable collection of poems that celebrate a great city.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MC6FOSOEGBI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849940371#wasThisHelpful","R2MC6FOSOEGBI1","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s a murder mystery story by something of a mystery author.According to her biography on both Amazon and Good Reads, Clara Benson was a rather upper class Englishwoman born in 1890 who wrote a series of mysteries during the golden age of murder mysteries – the 1920s and 1930s. She never published them, considering the manuscripts to be only a hobby. Even her family apparently knew nothing of them until long after her death in 1965. Almost 50 years later, in 2013, the family began to publish the stories.So far, nine have been published in the last two years or so, and another is in the works. They have all been published in ebook format only.Perhaps it’s the lack of biographical detail, or the impression that the first novel in the series reads less like one written in the 1920s and more like someone undertook a huge amount of research about English country life in the 1920s. There’s something that seems a bit too contemporary for this to have been written 90 years ago.So I have my suspicions. Clara Benson may not be Clara Benson at all.In The Murder at Sissingham Hall, Charles Know, a youngish man returning to his native England after eight years of making his fortune in South Africa, is invited for a long weekend at Sissinghurst Hall, the home of Sir Neville Strickland and his wife Rosamund. Rosamund is the reason Charles left England in the first place; she broke off their engagement without much explanation.It’s the almost stereotypical English house party so familiar in the Agatha Christie mysteries. Well-to-do people gathered together, passions running as a strong undercurrent beneath the brittle surface, and then a murder. In this case, the victim is Sir Neville. And most of the guests have a potential motive – the relative who is going to be written out of the will and his rather shallow wife; Rosamund Strickland; Charles Knox; and the niece, the secretary, and a flock of servants. Another guest is a friend of Rosamund’s, Angela Marchmont, who turns out to be something of an amateur sleuth and will help the police solve the murder.What’s surprising is that the novel is described as the first of the Angela Marchmont mysteries, and the character has a relatively small role in this particular story. Charles Knox serves as the narrator for the entire book.The Murder at Sissingham Hall is an enjoyable, classic 1920s-type mystery. And notice I said “type,” because I remain unconvinced that Clara Benson was a real person.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINN87F5NNXVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVC1SSE#wasThisHelpful","RINN87F5NNXVI","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve walked Fleet Street and Cannon Street in London. And Whitehall. I’ve taken the underground or tube more times than I can count. I’ve ridden buses down Charing Cross and up to Hampstead Heath. My knowledge of what was underneath my feet was, like most visitors and even many residents of London, was limited to the tube. Little did I know that I was walking over more than 2,000 years of buried history, secret tunnels, abandoned air raid shelters, closed tube stations, channeled rivers (several of them), old wells, and both formal and informal sewer systems.Peter Ackroyd, writer, biographer, and cultural historian, has set me straight in ”London Under.” It’s a fascinating, readable account of what lies under the streets, sidewalks, and buildings of one of the world’s great cities. It’s also made me aware of the outlines of abandoned tube stations, unobtrusive doors that lead downward, and the possible implications of what we mean when we say “underground.”And what’s under London has shaped what’s on the surface. Streets often follow paved-over and channeled rivers (which explains a lot of strange twists and turns in the City of London, that square mile that is the city’s origin and financial district). Bus rides to and from Hampstead Heath on the surface are simultaneously boat rides down various rivers.London’s history generally goes down about 26 feet. Ackroyd notes that one perhaps one of the few benefits of the German air blitz of London in 1940 and 1941 was the uncovering of a considerable portion of the city’s Roman history. All Hallows by-the-Tower Church was hit by a bomb and fire bombs, and the floor of a Roman residence was discovered. (Much later, excavations under the Guildhall uncovered the site of a Roman amphitheater.) Above the Roman layer is the Anglo-Saxon layer, topped by the medieval, Tudor and more modern layers.Ackroyd looks at how London has channeled and enclosed its rivers; how underground London came to be associated with the criminal underworld; the history of London’s sewers (at one time synonymous with its rivers and streets); the construction of the underground rail system; the tunnels built for various reasons (including a tunnel which stretches from Trafalgar Square down Whitehall almost all the way to Parliament); and the use of the tube system and its stations during both world wars as air raid shelters.For all of the iconic scenes in World War II movies showing people taking shelter in tube stations during the blitz, what Ackroyd points out was that it was a practice forced on the government by the citizens. At first, the Ministry of Transport forbade people using the stations as shelters, which the people obligingly ignored.“London Under” is filled with unknown facts and well-researched insights, but it is more than a collection of trivia. Ackroyd is too good a writer simply to publish a trivia collection. Instead, he plumbs the terrain that is beneath London’s streets and buildings with a practiced and experienced eye, and sees through the darkness this great city is built upon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PM9VBNM1GTY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPM16M#wasThisHelpful","R3PM9VBNM1GTY7","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A novel about a teenager with Asperger’s Syndrome wins prestigious prizes for adult novel, children’s novel, and teen novel, becomes a hit play, and never once mentions Asperger’s Syndrome anywhere in the text.Likely because it’s not about Asperger’s Syndrome. Not really.Mark Haddon’s “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”  was first published in the United Kingdom in 2003. It won several awards, including the Whitbread Award for best novel of the year in the UK. It also made the long list for the Man Booker Award. Two years ago, Haddon adapted the story for the stage, and it won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play.The story’s main character is 15-year-old Christopher Boone, who lives with his father in Swindon, not far from London in southern England. His mother had earlier died from a heart condition. Because of his condition, Christopher attends a special-needs school. He is absolutely brilliant at mathematics, what the British call “maths,” and has in-depth knowledge of astronomy and physics. He also doesn’t like the colors yellow and brown, and seeing several yellow cars means he will have a bad day. Red, however, is different, and seeing several red cars in traffic means he will have a very good day. He also can’t bare to be touched.Christopher begins to write the account we’re reading because someone has killed a neighbor’s dog. He found the dog’s body; the neighbor accused him and called the police. Because he likes the puzzles presented by Sherlock Holmes stories, Christopher decides he will investigate the dog’s killing and determine who did it.We watch how Christopher’s mind works as he investigates, and Haddon has gotten himself inside the head of a person with Asperger’s Syndrome. The boy is very literal-minded, has trouble with nonverbal communication, gets himself sidetracked by mathematical and scientific considerations, and is often terrified of the most common things, including a change in circumstances. And virtually all of Christopher’s circumstances are about to change.Christopher’s story becomes our story, about the brokenness in our lives and the brokenness of families. It’s a coming-of-age story, but at the same time is far more than that; this the reason why the novel has won so many different kinds of awards (although the occasional strong language and some situations make the work problematical for children; I’m not sure why it would have won an award for children’s fiction, because it is not a children’s story.)Haddon is the author of several novels and young adult novels, including “A Spot of Bother” (2007) and “The Red House” (2013). He blogs under his own name.“The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” is a remarkable book and one fine novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375RG6EKOI52E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400032717#wasThisHelpful","R375RG6EKOI52E","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is 1955. Hugo Hawksworth is an agent with the U.K.’s Special Branch, sent to what is essentially a desk job at a department in rural England. His leg was injured by a shooting in Berlin; he will likely be spending the rest of his life using a cane. In tow is his much younger teenage sister Georgia. Through the assistance of a colleague, Hugo and Georgia settle into temporary lodgings at the castle in Selchester, the ancestral home of the earls of Selchester.They also settle into a good case of murder. Eight years earlier, the last earl was hosting a dinner party, and apparently walked out into the middle of a blizzard and was never seen again. Without a body, the estate cannot enter probate; there’s no successor to the title of missing earl, as his son and heir was killed during the British occupation of Palestine after World War II. His rather grasping daughter Sonia can’t do anything with the castle until the missing earl’s fate is determined.And then a leaking pipe requires the digging up of part of the castle’s chapel floor. A skeleton is found, one wearing the ring the earl always wore. And it turns out to be the missing earl. The people who were the earl’s dinner guests, including his now-deceased son and his niece Freya Wryton, turn into suspects. The police are eager, perhaps too eager, to pin the murder on the dead son. But nothing is that simple.Elizabeth Edmondson’s “A Man of Some Repute” is complicated, but no more so than any of the kind of English mysteries we associate with Agatha Christie, P.D. James, Ngaio March and other classic English mystery writers. It’s full of hidden papers, family passions, and occasional twists and turns. It held my interest to the very last page.Edmondson is a writer of historical mysteries. She’s written several set in Italy, the French Riviera, Dorset and even on an ocean liner. The stories are set in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.A Man of Some of Repute, published in July, is the first of Edmondson’s “Very English Mysteries,” and will be followed later this month by “A Question of Inheritance,” set in Selchester and with the same leading characters. She also writes as Elizabeth Aston (she is one busy writer!).Hugo and the Selchester niece Freya work together to try to solve the mystery, with occasional help from the high-spirited sister Georgia and Hugo’s uncle Leo, a Catholic priest. As they learn more about what actually happened on the night of the dinner in 1947, they uncover a series of ugly family stories, with national security implications. And while the book is not a romantic mystery, Edmondson is masterful at creating the expectation of romance between Hugo and Freya, without a single direct reference to any romance at all.“A Man of Some Repute” is a fully satisfying mystery. I’m looking forward to its successor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IML8SY5MKVMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUGL1AG#wasThisHelpful","R2IML8SY5MKVMR","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, the poems of Ellen Kombiyil seem familiar to a reader of contemporary poetry. Most of the poems in “Histories of Future Perfect” are relatively short; some do without punctuation and use more abstract language and concepts than Murray’s. And yet a closer reading shows that Kombiyil is also a master of telling a story, in short and concise ways.Look at what she does with “Recurring 1,” which could be a story of death, of a failed love affair, and perhaps both.Recurring 1around me sound of choppingit’s an old dream manufactured peopleonce known are dancing no sweat no smellvision of frivolous spinning spillsdiamonds on the dance floor & you arenot dead your apparition in the frameof someone else’s photo here & not-here here I see you not-here drawn backthrough a tunnel black the world not yetbeginning to close where you emergesmiling & whole I tell you I miss youwith my hear not my words because you area word for both longing & sorrow& I claim you now with my silent mouthThe collection includes several of what I’d call “historical poems,” or at least poems with historical subjects—Mary Lincoln trying to reach her dead son Willie; William McKinley’s wife Ida having a premonition of his assassination; a letter written at the end of the Civil War. Kombiyil addresses more familiar subjects, too, like Kurt Cobain, eating at a Denny’s restaurant, and stories from childhood.Kombiyil is a native of Syracuse, New York, and graduated from the University of Chicago.

"Joan Murray has been publishing poetry for the last 25 years, and this year has an expanded volume, “Swimming for the Ark: New and Selected Poems.” In addition to new poetry, she draws upon poems from four volumes published between 1990 and 2015.Her poems tell stories. In fact, given the poems included in this new volume, Murray has been a storytelling poet from the beginning.“Her Head,” included in this new volume, is a good example.Her HeadNear Ekuvukeni,in Natal, South Africa,a woman carries water on her head.After a year of drought,when one child in three is at risk of death,she returns from a distant well,carrying water on her head.The pumpkins are gone,the tomatoes withered,yet the woman carries water on her head.The cattle kraals are empty,the goats gaunt—no milk now for children,but she is carrying water on her head.The engineers have reversed the river:those with power can keep their power,but one woman is carrying water on her head.In the homelands, where the dusty crowdswatch the empty roads for water trucks,one woman trusts herself with treasure,and carries water on her head.The sun does not dissuade her,not the dried earth that blows against her,as she carries the water on her head.In a huge and dirty pail,with an idle handle,resting on a narrow can,this woman is carrying water on her head.This woman, who girds her neckwith safety pins, this onewho carries water on her head,trusts her own head to bring to her peoplewhat they need nowbetween life and death:She is carrying them water on her head.The language is simple and straightforward; nothing abstract to leave you guessing at meaning. But those simple and straightforward words tell a profound story about a woman carrying water on her head.The volume also includes 15 of the 48 poems published as “Queen of the Mist” (1999), which both individually and collectively tell the story of the first person (a woman) to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Each poem is a separate story; together they present a woman who was struggling to provide for herself and discovered a way to do that—including going on the lecture circuit after the event and taking her barrel along for a prop, and doing that for 20 years.Murray’s other collections are “The Same Water” (1990), “Looking for the Parad”e (2000), and “Dancing on the Edge” (2002). She’s received two poetry fellowships for the National Endowment for the Arts, and her poems have appeared in numerous publications and anthologies.

"For most if not all of his adult life, writer Wendell Berry (born 1934) has been remarkably consistent in his belief and his worldview that the industrialization of America had created a kind of violence upon the land, communities, and the people. In more than 50 works of fiction, poetry, and non-fiction, he’s adhered to that belief, which is informed by his Christian faith.Industrialization includes everything from an agriculture dependent upon fossil fuels and chemicals and mining practices that scour the landscape to the destruction of forests. He sees both major political parties have having facilitated this, and indeed often with the collusion of environmental groups. And he sees corporate capitalism as having wreaked destruction upon the political, social, and economic landscapes as well as the physical landscape.In “Our Only World: Ten Essays,” Berry continues his discussion of that violence and destruction, along with a focus on examples of where he sees people are making a difference. The title is something of a misnomer; the 10 essays are actually 10 articles, speeches and essays. But they are simultaneously vintage Berry and contemporary Berry. And he has much to say, and much that needs to be listened to and heeded.The two longest essays in the book are the fullest discussions of his philosophy and belief. “A Forest Conversation” discusses historical forestry and logging practices but focuses on a family in Pennsylvania that has undertaken sustainable forestry for decades. “Our Deserted Country” focuses on agriculture, and considers how industrialized agriculture has changed local communities, the land, our attitudes about the land, and even our attitudes about the value of people.“Caught in the Middle” tackles two social issues that Berry sees as connected to what industrialized has wrought – abortion and homosexual marriage. He generally opposes the first and supports the second, but he laments that both have become so politicized that the middle ground has essentially been destroyed. Even if you disagree with him on these issues, his gentle and thoughtful arguments will at least make you consider just how well your own beliefs are thought out. And his arguments are well worth reading.“Our Only World” is not a long book but it is a worthwhile one. Much of what he says resonates with common sense, and much of what he says about industrialization is, I would say, on the mark. The question, as he well knows, is what do we do about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27W1NXFAQM5H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSC4YM4#wasThisHelpful","R27W1NXFAQM5H0","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"C.C. de Poitiers isn’t the most likable of people. She bullies her husband and overweight daughter. She bullies the photographer she’s having an affair with. She’s deliberately hurtful and cruel to her new neighbors in Three Pines in Quebec, where she’s recently moved and occupied the largest house in the village. She is planning a major push for her book, Be Calm, in which she articulates of a philosophy of never showing emotion, and no one is going to get in her way.But someone does. Someone devises and implements death by electrocution, with dozens of witnesses around who are watching a local curling match (a winter sport popular in Canada). The problem is that it might be easier to eliminate the few suspects who didn’t have a motive.“A Fatal Grace” is Louise Perry’s second mystery novel featuring Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Homicide Division of the Montreal Surete, and it is a psychological treat.Gamache and his team, along with the same dysfunctional detective sent by Gamache’s superiors in the first mystery novel, “Still Life,” are dispatched to investigate. But this is more than a murder; the death of C.C. de Poitiers becomes a prism through which the characters examine themselves and others. This is even more true for Gamache, who is still struggling with the aftermath of a case that ended in a mess, and actually didn’t end at all. Penny uses this story to expand upon what happened in that case and what role Gamache actually played.The investigation leads back to Montreal, where the death of a homeless woman seems connected to the electrocution, and then returns to three Pines, for it is in this quiet village of writers, artists and antique shops where the truth lies buried, and lies buried in the distant past.Penny weaves the two deaths, Gamache’s professional struggles, police department politics and the personal politics of the local townspeople together in an intriguing mystery. Particularly noteworthy is how she develops the physical setting as part of the story – a brutal Canadian winter.“A Fatal Grace” is a winner.

"Before he was the winner for the Nobel Prize for Literature, before he was recognized for some of the most innovative and remarkable poetry of the 20th century, before “The Hollow Men” became one of the most recognizable poems in modern times, he was Tom Eliot, young Tom Eliot.Thomas Stearnes Eliot was the youngest of six children, born in 1888 when his parents were 45. His siblings were considerably older than Tom. His was an upper class family in St. Louis, where his father was a vice president of a major brick manufacturer and his grandfather the founder of Washington University in St. Louis. His Unitarian family came from New England, and he was related to John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, Henry Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Adams, John Adams and John Quincy Adams.We’re more familiar with the latter half of Eliot’s career, from the time he was established as a poet of international renown, his Nobel Prize, and the poetry that in many ways helped to define Modernism in literary history. But before he was the famous poet, he was the boy, the young man at Harvard, and the expatriate in England.In “Young Eliot: From St. Louis to The Waste Land,” Robert Crawford explores the early Eliot in depth, covering the period from his birth to the publication of “The Waste Land” in 1922. Making use of letters, articles, other published resources and his own understandings of Eliot’s poems and poetry, Crawford draws a wonderfully three-dimensional portrait of the poet, including his growth and development, his flaws and failings, the relatively long incubation period for his poetry to become recognized, and the critical role played by how well Eliot fit into the literary circles of London from 1915 to 1922.Crawford explains the huge impact that the discovery of the French Symbolist poets made on Eliot while a student at Harvard. His introduction was ""The Symbolist Movement"" in Literature by Arthur Symons (1899) and especially the poet Jules Laforgue (1860-1887), whose poetry is still in print. After graduation, Eliot spent a year studying in Paris. Eventually, he was accepted into Merton College, Oxford, for a year of study, but first went to the University of Marburg in Germany for a summer study session, which is where he was when World War I began in 1914. He was eventually allowed to leave, and reached England through neutral Holland.England was where Eliot made his home from that time onward; the following year, he met Vivien (often spelled Vivienne) Haigh-Wood, and three months later they married. The marriage was troubled from the outset, with Vivien’s chronic illnesses and her affair with Bertrand Russell causing major stresses and fractures. Disliked by his literary friends, nonetheless Vivien, Crawford tells us, consistently championed Eliot’s poetry and what she considered her husband’s genius.The circles the Eliots moved within the London literary scene included Ezra Pound (an early promoter of Eliot’s poetry), Bertrand Russell, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and Edith Sitwell and  her brother Osbert, among many others. Eliot had a serious knack for networking, and he utilized it to the fullest. Pound, for example, convinced the editor of Poetry Magazine in Chicago to publish “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” who positioned it in the back of the magazine because he didn’t like it.Crawford details all of the activities Eliot was involved in: literary journalism (articles and book reviews), his work at Lloyd’s Bank (which he found rather soothing), editing literary journals, and helping to promote other poets and writers like James Joyce. Eliot had a huge capacity for work. And he details the various influences leading up to the creation and publication of “The Waste Land.”The author brings a wealth of research and understanding to the subject of Eliot. He is the Professor Modern Scottish Literature at the University of St. Andrews, and a fellow of both the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Academy. He’s the author of “The Savage and the City in the Work of T.S. Eliot” (1991), as well as several works on Scottish literature, including “Bannockburns: Scottish Independence and Literary Imagination 1314-2014,” “The Bard: Robert Burns, A Biography” (2009), and “Scotland’s Books: A History of Scottish Literature” (2009). He is also a published poet, with six poetry collections, including “Talkies” (1992), “Masculinity” (1996), “Spirit Machines” (1999), “Full Volume” (2008), “The Tip of My Tongue” (2011), and “Testament” (2014).What emerges from “Young Eliot” is a distinctly human figure, a man of enormous intellect and talent whose hard work and innovative poetry eventually would catapult him into being one of the literary icons of the 20th century. In an exhaustively researched and well-written work, Crawford tells us where that all came from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG99072RRN88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE0DHWQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CG99072RRN88","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But the musician who influenced them, and had an impact that is still reverberating 18 years after his death, is Rich Mullins.Song after song, hit after hit, Mullins was as known for his music as he was for his rather iconoclastic reaction to fame. He shrugged it off. He saw himself as a broken vessel, redeemed by his Creator, and his music reflected that belief.And millions of people identified with that music. “My God is an Awesome God,” “Step by Step,” “Creed,” “Elijah”  – songs written and recorded by Mullins and recorded by scores of other musicians. Some have already made their way into contemporary hymn books.Mullins was also known for his friendship with Brennan Manning (1937-2013), and was counseled by Manning the last few years of his life. Mullins adopted Brenann’s “Ragamuffin gospel” for the name of his band, and how he described himself – a ragamuffin.Mullins’ influence extended into my own family. I can remember how the news of his death in an automobile accident in 1997 affected both my wife and my oldest son, who was then in high school. For them and millions of others, Mullins’ death was more than the death of a favored musician or even a friend; it was like losing someone whose music touched their hearts and souls.In 2000, James Bryant Smith wrote a biography of Mullins, “Rich Mullins: A Devotional Biography: An Arrow Pointing to Heaven,” and he did it in an unusual way. Rather than the more common chronological account, Smith wrote the biography as a devotional. Perhaps for that reason, the work has remained current.With an introduction by Brennan Manning, the biography is structured around 10 devotional themes: family, creed, the love of God, trusting in Jesus, creation, struggle and pain, simplicity, sin and temptation, loving one another, and death and the life to come. The discussion for each theme combines, biographical information, interviews with people who knew Mullins, some of Mullins’ own writings, quotations, and the words of Mullins’ songs. With such disparate elements, the biography could have come across disjointed and cobbled together, but it doesn’t; it stays centered on Mullins and his faith.This was a widely popular Christian musician whose typical concert clothes were a t-shirt, jeans, and bare feet. Early on, he fronted at concerts for big name Christian bands; by the end of his life, the singer and songwriter who typically performed in church settings had eclipsed them all.The most telling line in the book, among many telling lines, is this, and it speaks volumes about Mullins and his work: “Rich Mullins was not encumbered by the need to succeed; he was captive to the need to create.”Smith received his M.Div. degree from Yale University Divinity School and his D. Min. degree from Fuller Seminary. He is a professor of theology at Friends University in Wichita, Kansas, and leads the Christian Spiritual Formation Institute there. And he’s the author of numerous books.“Rich Mullins: A Devotional Biography” is a profound way to do two things simultaneously: learn about the life and music of a man who became a legend, and examine one’s own life in the process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ZQ4N7YNOHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OC01RC#wasThisHelpful","R30ZQ4N7YNOHB","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1912, poet Robert Frost (1874-1963) and his family moved to England. His writing career was not happening in the United States, and a flip of a coin made the decision for England instead of Canada. It was in England that he was finally offered a contract by a British publisher. The resulting book caught the attention of a British poet and literary journalist, Edward Thomas (1878-1917), and Frost and Thomas became good friends.They often took walks in the countryside together, and Frost was often amused by his friend’s indecision as to which walking route to take, and then to regret the one chosen. Frost later sent Thomas a poem, entitled “Two Roads,” which Frost thought of as a kind of joke about Thomas’s indecision and a parody on the romantic imagination. For his part, Thomas seemed not to realize it was meant as a joke, and took it quite seriously, as the exchange of letters between the two indicates.Thomas eventually enlisted in the British Army, and died in 1917 in France. Today he’s known as one of the World War I poets. Frost went on to become, more than anyone else, the “American Poet.” And his poem, “Two Roads,” was renamed, and became “The Road Not Taken,” perhaps the best known American poem of the 20th century, and perhaps the best known American poem, period.The Road Not TakenTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.In “The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong,” author David Orr tackles this most famous poem and argues, convincingly, that it is not only the best known American poem, it is also the most misunderstood poem.And it’s misunderstood for the simple reason that it doesn’t say what we think it says. The poem is actually far more complex than what so many of us have heard in countless graduation ceremonies. And there is essentially no difference between the two roads.Orr is a poetry columnist for The New York Times Book Review and a professor at Cornell University. His first book, “Beautiful & pointless: A Guide to Modern Poetry,” was published in 2011. He brings a wealth of perspective, ranging from history and poetry to the science of the brain, to the subject of this poem.He considers the poet, who Frost was (and wasn’t), his biography, and the biographical context for the poem. He then analyzes the poem itself, asking what in hindsight look like obvious questions. He then discusses the choice of roads, the whole notion of choice and its place in the American psyche and the idea of roads as opposed to paths. Finally, he examines the chooser, who it is who’s confronted with the choice of roads.Orr notes that readers were captivated by the “thrill of sincerity” they found in Frost’s poetry. “The perception of authenticity became Frost’s trademark, at least among general readers,” he writes. His looming presence in American poetry, reaching its height in the 1950s and especially with the inauguration of President Kennedy in 1961, at which Frost started to read a poem he had written for the occasion and then discarded it, reciting another (and better) one from memory.That presence barely survived his death. In the iconoclastic 1960s and 1970s, Frost’s reputation suffered greatly, first at the hands of his official biographer and then at the hands of academics. He became known as a “monster,” Orr writes, on the basis of very little evidence. But “The Road Not Taken” fared better, and continued as a staple in school graduations. The academics may have sniffed at Frost, but he was still loved by general readers.One hundred years after its first publication (August marked the centennial), “The Road Not Taken” remains a beloved American poem. Even with its contradictions and misunderstandings, it remains an important of the American poetic landscape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MYENGV5ZVB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ0TKO8#wasThisHelpful","R17MYENGV5ZVB6","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“By Divine Right” is a novella by Patrick Carr that is largely part of a marketing plan. But it also happens to be such an intriguing story that it both stands alone and serves what it’s designed to do – entice the reader to a new fantasy trilogy that begins publication in Late October.The trilogy is The Darkwater Saga, and the first volume due Oct. 27 is “The Shock of Night.” If this volume and it successors live up to the promise of “By Divine Right,” then it will be a very good trilogy indeed.The setting is the capital city of Bunard in the kingdom of Collum. The story is told by Willet Dura, a reeve (or guard officer) in the service of the king. Some years previously, the kingdom had been at war, and, called up to fight, Willet had missed his ordination as priest by a week. Because he fought and killed in the war, he is no longer eligible to be a priest, and least in the order he had prepared for.The is a land where gifts are important. Nobles and the wealthy each have a gift – beauty, craft, sum, parts, helps, or devotion. Gifts are vitally important, the “currency” around which society is centered. Only the king has all the gifts, which are transmitted to each generation. Sometimes gifts are split among children, reducing their power and effectiveness. Common people and the poor rarely if ever have a whole or part of a gift.Willet becomes involved in the whole subject of gifts when he investigates the murder of a man whose gift was stolen. As it turns out, others have been killed and their gifts stolen. Someone is killing people and collecting their gifts, which can mean only one thing – someone is planning to usurp the kingship.Even in the short form of the novella, Carr develops the main plot and sub-plots. Characterization in the story is especially strong; the characters are almost immediately recognizable and understood. (Readers have noted this in his previous trilogy of books, “The Staff & the Sword.”)A good story in and of itself, “By Divine Right” suggests there’s an even better story coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22N0PZYVPTPU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112WVVBQ#wasThisHelpful","R22N0PZYVPTPU7","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Basilica Cathedral of St. Louis is one the city’s great landmarks located near several other landmarks. Situated on Lindell Boulevard in what we call the Central West End, it’s close to Forest Park, the St. Louis Art Museum, and the Barnes-Jewish Hospital complex and medical center. The cathedral’s distinctive green roof can be seen from miles away on Interstate 64, and its interior is famous for what is the largest installation of mosaic decoration anywhere in the world. Pope John Paul II said mass here when he visited St. Louis in 1999, and it was the church where baseball great Stan Musial’s funeral was conducted.It’s also an unlikely seen for a murder, this place that even we Protestants call “the New Cathedral” to distinguish it from the “Old Cathedral” adjacent to the St. Louis Arch. But that’s exactly what it is in “The Broken Cross,” the second Cameron Ballack mystery by Luke Davis.An attorney, fresh from a major courtroom win defending the St. Louis Archdiocese, is found stabbed to death in one of the cathedral’s chapels. Ballack and his partner Tori Vaughan, police detectives assigned to the suburban St. Charles County Police Department, are currently assigned to the special investigation unit that investigates major crimes with significant religious connections.In this case, Ballack is assigned as the lead detective, a not-exactly-welcomed move from the other officers involved in the investigation. They’re from the City of St. Louis’s Police Department, and they don’t initially take kindly to having to report from the rube from St. Charles. Not to mention the fact that Ballack is wheelchair-bound. But Ballack is in charge because of his success in solving a series of murders at an Orthodox seminary in St. Charles County, once that nearly cost him and his partner’s lives (“Litany of Secrets,” the first Cameron Ballack mystery).This case involves the scandal of sexual abuse that engulfed the Catholic Church, a priest shuffled from ministry to ministry, a suicide from five years before, lawyers and real estate executives trying to shield the Archdiocese’s assets, and a more-than-sufficient number of suspects.It is one enormously satisfying mystery story. Davis is a great storyteller who does something interesting with his lead character. What might have easily become too much sympathy for the man in the wheelchair is blunted by Ballack’s character – slightly acerbic, something of a chip on his shoulder, not exactly the guy you’d like to have a beer with. Despite his Christian parents, he’s trying to find God, not entirely convinced of his existence. And he even has a love interest. In short, he’s recognizably human. His first-rate mind and ability to process information and connect the dots will eventually identify the killer. But he does make mistakes.Davis teaches at Westminster Christian Academy in St. Louis. He’s also taught at schools in Louisiana, Florida, and Virginia. He describes himself as “Presbyterian body, Lutheran heart, Anglican blood, Orthodox spirit,” all of which have served him well in writing the Cameron Ballack mysteries.I have to say I can’t help but enjoy reading a story with recognizable sights from the city where I live. In addition to the Cathedral, there’s the Drury Inn downtown, Cardinal stadium, Whitfield School, familiar office buildings and law offices in Clayton (the county seat of St. Louis County), references to numerous suburbs, Fast Eddie’s Restaurant across the Mississippi in Alton – well, you get the picture.“The Broken Cross” is a great story about horrifying events straight from the news that all of us are familiar with. It’s a fine mystery. And it ultimately is about what can happen when the church – any church – doesn’t deal with the sin that threatens to destroy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8BI4XXQXUM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014G7EQAC#wasThisHelpful","R1U8BI4XXQXUM7","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Panama City, Florida, 1943: Jimmy Riley is a former cop turned private detective. It’s wartime, lots of federal money is being spent, and corruption abounds. A mayor’s race is looming, and the stakes, if primarily local, are high. The best candidate happens to be married to a beauty named Lauren Lewis, who happens to be Jimmy Riley’s former lover and the woman he’s still besotted with.Jimmy is called “Soldier,” because everyone assumes his injury happened as a result of wartime fighting. It didn’t; what it had to do with was Lauren. Jimmy’s injury is that he lost his right arm, the one he wrote with; the one he shot guns with.Welcome to “The Big Goodbye,” Michael Lister’s first of four Jimmy “Soldier” Riley mystery novels. And welcome to noir detective fiction, a 21st century interpretation of a genre that reach its peak in the 1930s and 1940s. The novel’s title, in fact, is likely borrowed from two of the best known noir detective novels by Raymond Chandler, “The Big Sleep” and “The Long Goodbye.”The first of four novels in the Jimmy “Soldier” Riley series, “The Big Goodbye” has all the requisite noir features – a tough guy detective, a beautiful if flawed woman, lots of guns, policemen who step on both sides of the law, political corruption, a not-inconsiderable number of dead bodies, twists and turns, and even the most theoretically saintly characters often caught up in crime and violence.In this story, everything turns on Lauren Lewis – why she’s being blackmailed (she won’t say), who’s pressuring her husband to quit the mayoral race, and what a sanitarium and its doctor are really up. Jimmy loves Lauren too much to let it all go, and he finds himself sinking ever more quickly into the violence and corruption surrounding him.Having read a fair number of the novels in the noir detective genre (in addition to Raymond Chandler, there’s Dashiell Hammett, Mickey Spillane, and even the police procedurals of Ed McBain, among many others), I would say The Big Goodbye is a credible and entertaining entry in the genre. Lister uses some profanity, which one won’t find in the novels written back in the 1930s and 1940s, and a couple of explicit scenes that wouldn’t have made it past the publisher’s first readers or review committee those long decades ago. Those elements aside, Lister is faithful to the genre.Lister followed “The Big Goodbye” in 2011 with three additional titles in the series: “The Big Beyond “(2013), “The Big Hello” (2014), and “The Big Bout” (2015). If you’re a fan of detective fiction in general and the noir genre in particular, this is a good contemporary series to discover and read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISW66Q58V6S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005890UEY#wasThisHelpful","R3ISW66Q58V6S4","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He was a boy who came from a relatively poor family living in a small town near Florence. He was able to go to a school in Florence, but had to buy a bicycle for transportation. He worked and saved his money, and was finally able to buy a fourth-hand bike.It changed his life. The boy became Gino Bartali, one of the great cycling legends. In “Road to Valor: A True Story of World War II Italy, the Nazis, and the Cyclist Who Inspired a Nation,” Aili and Andres McConnon tell Bartali’s story.Actually, they tell three interlocking stories.The first is Gino Bartali the great cyclist, who won the Tour de France twice – with each win separated by a decade – a record for time in-between wins that’s still unbroken.The second is Gino Bartali the Italian resistance messenger, who at the behest of the Archbishop of Florence smuggled fake identity documents all over northern Italy, hidden in his bicycle. What he did saved the lives of hundreds of Jews. He even hid a Jewish family from the Nazis in his basement in Florence.The third is Gino Bartali, the man whose impossible victory in a Tour de France stage in the Alps helped to stop exploding violence in Italy between the Communist and Christian Democratic parties. As one observer pointed out, men who had been trying to kill each other suddenly turned their attention northward, and celebrated Bartali’s victory together. Bartali had been 21 minutes behind the Tour leader, and in one stage erased the difference. He powered on to win the 1948 Tour, despite all of sports journalists and cycling fans who considered him a “washed-up old man” at 33.The story of helping the Italian resistance and saving the lives of Jews was learned only fairly recently. Bartali, who died in 2000 at the age of 85, never talked about until late in life, when he told his oldest son some of what happened. Others, especially the Jewish families he helped to save, corroborated his story. His cycling around Tuscany, Umbria and other Italian locales could always be explained as “training.” But secreted in the tubes of his bicycle were false identity papers, to help protect Jews and also to help many escape.The McConnons tell a riveting, wonderful story. Bartali wasn’t a saint; he had his human frailties like the rest of us. But he had great courage, and he acted on that courage – to save lives, and to win an impossible race. Even if you’re not a cycling fan, “Road to Valor” is an inspiring, moving account of a terrible time in human history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YT7ZIK9CWAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OGY1DG#wasThisHelpful","R3YT7ZIK9CWAW","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Noir detective fiction reigned supreme in America in the 1920s and 1930s, and remained popular through most of the 1950s. And the author who was the acknowledged master of this genre was Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961).The former Pinkerton detective turned to writing detective stories when he was afflicted with tuberculosis, a disease that would plague him most of his adult life. He wrote stories for “the pulps” – popular detective magazines and a series of novels that set the standard for noir fiction, and in fact likely still set the standard.He published “Red Harvest” in 1929, followed by “The Dain Curse” that same year. Then came :The Maltese Falcon” in 1930, “The Glass Key” in 1931, and “The Thin Man” in 1934. The novels are written tightly and concisely, and are full of action, unexpected turns, and a fair amount of violence. (One of Hammett’s fellow noir writers, Philip Marlowe, gave this writing advice to authors facing writing blocks: “When in doubt, have to men come in the door with guns.”) A group of his stories was published as “The Continental Op.”Hammett’s influence on writers – and on the movies – extended far beyond noir fiction. He’s considered so influential, in fact, that Library of America has published a volume of his novels and a volume of his short stories.My first awareness of Dashiell Hammett was watching The Thing Man movies of the 1930s and early 1940s on television. Starring William Powell as detective Nick Charles and Myrna Loy as his wife Nora, the movies were widely popular when they were first released. If you’re familiar with the movies at all, it’s almost impossible to see anyone but William Powell when you read the Hammett novel.I discovered Hammeett as a writer in the 1970s, during a resurgence of the novels of the glory days of noir fiction. I also discovered the Dashiell Hammett who was in love with playwright Lillian Hellman and the Hammett who went to prison rather than divulge names to a congressional committee during the Red Scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s.In the last few years, additional writings have turned up in archives and various closets, including two “movie books” written for the scripts of “After the Thin Man” and “Another Thin Man,” both commissioned by MGM Studios. Movie books were essentially novellas written to help the scriptwriters develop and finalize a script. Both of these movie books, and related materials, never previously made public, were published in 2012 as “Return of the Thin Man.”The stories are less novellas than they are movie and Dashiell Hammett artifacts. They even contain periodic filming instructions and parenthetical statements instructing the scriptwriters how to develop particular scenes. Accompanying the stories are headnotes and afterwords by the editors, Richard Layman and Julie M. Rivett.The stories reflect the public tastes in movies in the time period they were released. They often seem formulaic, with “thugs and dames” getting themselves mixed up with the wealthy (and, in one of the stories, even with Nora’s very proper family). The genius of the stories lies not so much in the stories themselves as it does in how Hammett developed the interaction between and relationship of Nick and Nora Charles, which steal the story and also stole the movies. The dialogue involving their back-and-forth is still fascinating today, underscoring how much Hammett could communicate by what wasn’t said as much as by what was.For fans of noir fiction, it’s a must-read. For those interested in how a master writer developed dialogue, it’s also a must-read. For those of us fascinated with the genre and the period, not to mention what Hammett achieved, it’s a significant contribution to understanding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NCYGEJDHOP9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DYICJG#wasThisHelpful","R1NCYGEJDHOP9E","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 1987, a man named Joseph Kony emerged in northern Uganda as the head of a rebel group called the Lord’s Resistance Army, or LRA. While fighting and rebel armies in Africa are nothing new, Kony brought a new level of barbarity to warfare – killing adults and capturing children for both soldiers and sexual slaves.The LRA’s activities went on until 2006, when a truce was worked out with the Ugandan government and the LRA seemingly disappeared toward the Congo or (some say) Sudan. In between, an estimated 100,000 people were killed, 20,000 children abducted and 1.5 million citizens forced to flee, many ending up in what were called “IDP camps,” or the refugee sites of “Internally Displaced Persons.”The statistics contain sufficient horror. The individual stories describe the horror in human terms that bring the statistics home. But while there was the horror, there was also hope. And that is the story told by Joanne Norton in “The Soroti Project: A Heart-Filled and Heartless Story in Uganda.”Norton had worked as a missionary in Uganda previously, and she eventually found herself called back to a place to which she thought she’d never return. She found the horror and the tragedy, and she found the hope.Just as she did in her book “The Annie Project,” Norton writes her story as fiction, combining both her own real experiences (and some actual photos) with a fictional technique. But the stories are real.The story focuses on one IDP camp, located northeast of the capital of Kampala near the town of Soroti. Norton and fellow missionaries live there for a time, working with the people, local churches, and friends. She leaves little to the imagination about the living conditions the missionaries experienced – ongoing worries about the food and water; mosquitoes and malaria; threats to personal safety; and the conditions of latrines.But these pale in comparison to the stories she tells.Children who were enslaved but managed to escape. A man who the LRA thought it killed three times, until the soldiers threatened to kill their captain if he tried again. The teenage boy Boniface, who died in the arms of his sister. The pastors who risked their lives to serve the refugees and victims. The good humor and laughter of the people in spite of what they’ve endured. And the growth and spread of Christian faith.“The Soroti Project” is a deeply moving account, not only for making the experience of millions of people real but also for the hope that’s always there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TRHVOFQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRKPUBC#wasThisHelpful","R36TRHVOFQC","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Summer Son” by Craig Lancaster is a story about a father and son, and how they are separated by more than miles. It’s a story about the oil fields in the West, and drilling in places like the Uinta Basin in Utah. And it’s about family, and family secrets, secrets buried but still affecting the lives of people who had nothing to do with them.Mitch Quillen sells medical equipment. He, his wife Cindy and twin children live in San Jose. The marriage is rocky and getting rockier. Mitch hears from his father Jim about once a year; then he hears from him three times in a week. Each call lasts less than a minute. Cindy, knowing that their marriage is tied into Mitch’s problems with his father, convinces him to fly to Billings, Montana, to see what’s happening and try to resolve the relationship.The answer is buried in the past, and buried even further back than Mitch realizes. When Mitch was a child, he spent summers with his father. His parents were divorced; his father was an independent oilfield driller based in Billings but working all over the West. The story moves back and forth from the crucial summer of 1979, when something happened that broke the father-and-son relationship, to the current year of 2007.Mitch will learn that the reasons for his broken relationship with his father stretch back to his father’s own childhood. And also explain his father’s two broken marriages.It’s a captivating story, one that asks deep questions, compelling the reader to think through his own relationship with his father, and how much he does, and doesn’t, know.In the process, we learn a lot about the oil business and its boom-and-bust cycles, the hard and fast living of many of the people involved in it, a fair amount of oilfield profanity, and how a father and son have to face the question of whether they even want to understand each other.Lancaster is the author of several novels and a short story collection, including “Quantum Physics and the Art of Departure: Stories” (2011); “600 Hours of Edward” (2012); “Edward Adrift” (2013); “The Fallow Season of Hugo Hunter” (2014); and :This is What I Want” (2015).

"Last September, a movie about the Rapture – the “taking up” of believing Christians prior to the end times described in the Biblical book of Revelation – was released in theaters. Reception of the movie was so-so, and it seems to have disappeared rather quickly. After all of the “Left Behind” books by Tim LeHaye and Jerry Jenkins (with Nicholas Cage in the movie), perhaps there’s nothing left to the imagination about the Rapture and its aftermath.The movie script for “The Remaining” was “novelized,” and Travis Thrasher was the author who wrote the book, published under the same title. I normally don’t read novelizations, but I’ve read one of Thrasher’s before, “Home Run,” and he writes good stuff, even if he has to work from rather weak scripts.The book is profoundly disturbing. Perhaps it’s meant to be. But my response to it has lingered for days after finishing it.The story filters the Rapture through that most commonplace of events – a wedding. Six friends have come together for the wedding of two them in Wilmington, North Carolina. They’re all from the area; they’ve all gone to school together. A year before the wedding, one of them, Lauren, had a series of horrific visions and dreams about her friends dying. But the visions had faded, and this is a joyful event for the couple getting married, Dan and Skylar.The entire book is set in roughly a 24-hour time period.It’s during the wedding reception that the Rapture happens, except the believing Christians aren’t “taken up” bodily. They simply drop dead, and it is their souls that are taken up. Lauren is the only one of the six who dies on the spot.Chaos ensues. Explosions, plane crashes, trumpets sounding, fires, a ferocious hailstorm. Then comes the attacks by something – reptiles? Demons? It’s hard to see them clearly at night, but they’re attacking anything connected to faith, like church buildings, and anyone who is gaining faith as a result of the unfolding events. As events progress, the five remaining friends learn that this isn’t just happening in Wilmington but all around the world. Civilization as they’ve known it for all of their young lives had suddenly and horrifically come to an end.Thrasher uses short chapters, and tight (and tense) writing to build the suspense and, yes, the horror. At times it’s difficult to keep reading, because it seems that all hope has been removed, and judgment is at hand. Telling the story through a wedding (taken from the movie script) somehow makes the narrative both terrible and compelling.The effects of The Remaining still linger in the mind, though. And the heart. Thrasher has once again told a good, if horrible, story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RUKD825LHOOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J37O0MK#wasThisHelpful","R2RUKD825LHOOL","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It begins normally enough: a small group of teenagers plan a slightly disobedient get-together up by long-abandoned mines up in the mountains. By the time the night is done, the small town of Crow Hollow will be under a curse, a curse that leads to hysteria, destruction, and death.This is Billy Coffey’s “The Curse of Crow Hollow.” It is a dark tale, unremitting and unrelenting, a story that builds to a series of climaxes that will leave the town devastated, and reader with chewed fingernails.The story centers on five families: Bucky Vest works at the town dump, while his wife Angela watches television soap operas and daughter Cordelia believes she’s in love with Hays Foster. Hays parents, Landis and Kayann, own the local grocery store. Mayor Bickford and his daughter Sharon still mourn the death of his wife and her mother. David Ramsay is the church pastor; at home is his wife Belle and daughter Naomi, while his son John David stays with Chessie and Briar Hodge, the town’s suppliers of moonshine.The teens stumble into Alvaretta Graves, long rumored to be a witch. A confrontation ends with Scarlett striking Alvaretta, who speaks a curse on the teens and the town. And the curse begins immediately.It’s Coffey’s darkest tale yet and, I would argue, his best. It’s been a pleasure to watch his writing grow and develop. This is a story that would be difficult for any writer to keep command over, moving as it does through the main characters, minor characters, side stories and secrets buried in the past. But Coffey does it, and does it well.This story is a far cry from his first two novels, “Snow Day” and “Paper Angels.” The turn toward dark tales began with “When Mockingbirds Sing,” followed by “The Devil Walks in Mattingly” and “In the Heart of the Dark Wood.” The last three are set in the same general area of the Blue Ridge Mountains as “The Curse of Crow Hollow.”Of particular note is the unnamed narrator, who speaks with a Southern accent and a voice that is both knowledgeable and yet almost chilling. Who is this? It’s a man, likely an elderly man, but his identity isn’t revealed until the end.With “The Curse of Crow Hollow,” Billy Coffey is breaking new ground. He’s moved in a more literary direction. He has plumbed the depths of the emotions and realities of small town life. And what he’s best known for – telling simple but great stories about ordinary people – is in full flower.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4LD5WA1YP48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWOH2T6#wasThisHelpful","R1H4LD5WA1YP48","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always enjoy finding a new mystery series, and I believe I’ve found a good one with Chief Inspector Armand Gamache.Gamache, with the Surete de Quebec, is the creation of mystery writer Louise Penny; the first of her series of mysteries is ""Still Life,"" set in the small town of Three Pines in Quebec, not far from the American border. Gamache is called to investigate the death of an elderly woman, Jane Neal, shot in the woods apparently by an arrow. Neal was a rather eccentric artist – loved by her neighbors but one who had never shown her art nor let anyone in her house beyond the kitchen.Gamache and his team discover that what looks to be an accidental death caused by a hunter is actually murder, murder with a motive buried long in the past.Penny is strong on characterization, not only for Gamache and his police team but the rest of the major and minor characters as well, a collection of both rather normal and rather eccentric people, most of an artistic temperament. One of them, in this quaint little village, is a murderer.It is Gamache, however, who is the novel’s star. A loving husband with grown children, he is in his early 50s, enjoys good food, and believes in teamwork over lone wolf investigations. He has a past, with mostly notable investigatory successes but some have come at a cost. He listens and observes; he watches and likes to set potential suspect against potential suspect. He’s not convinced by an early confession. And he develops strong likes, and strong dislikes, for the people he meets.One of the characters is a poet, and poetry plays a surprisingly significant role in the story (as does art). A poem by W.H. Auden contains an important clue. And Penny includes interesting historical facts about the region that had color and depth to the story.And now I have the satisfaction of knowing there are several Chief Inspector Gamache stories waiting to be read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAX27S8GYUPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OLRMZA#wasThisHelpful","R2TAX27S8GYUPW","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every first-time father has fears about the newborn: Will I drop the baby? Do I know how to change the diaper? How do I know if the baby’s sick? Can I tell the difference between the need for a burp and colic?Writer and author Ed Cyzewski had an additional fear – he would be the stay-at-home dad while his wife attended graduate school.As it turned out, Cyzewski did just fine. What likely helped was that he blogged the experience of being a first-time father, which meant he could articulate his fears and worries and get ideas and encouragement from both dads and moms.In ""First Draft Father: A Write-from-Home Dad Finds the Joy/Anxiety/Exhaustion/Wonder of Parenting,"" Cyzewski has assembled and edited his blog posts and added a few articles published in other publications. The result is an honest, and real, account of fatherhood – and trying to juggle baby duties with being a freelance writer and author.As I said, Cyzewski did just fine – but there were many times when he felt the outcome was in doubt. Whether we’re stay-at-home dads or working dads, we all experience the feelings of doubt, frustration, fear, anxiety, frustration, anger – and love.He deals with “the real” of babies – the exhaustion, the trade-offs, the best-laid-plans that blow up when the baby decides not to nap, doing whatever it takes to get the baby to sleep (if that means walking him in the stroller during a thunderstorm, so be it); dealing with all the great and not-so-great advice; and the times when you break.It’s been 27 years since our second son was a newborn – and reading ""First Draft Father"" was walking back through those times when I did things I never dreamed of doing B.C. – before children. And learned things I never dreamed of learning.What Ed Cyzewski has served up is a big helping of encouragement, understanding, and experience. Read ""First Draft Father"" if you getting ready to become one, if you are one, ir if you were one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TX8X9N14FXHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYSGBB0#wasThisHelpful","R2TX8X9N14FXHP","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first encounter with the novels of Iain Pears was “An Instance of the Fingerpost,” published in 1999. I was enthralled by a story that was almost hypnotic, not to mention almost impossible to put down (and it was a long story). I was just as taken by a second novel, “The Dream of Scipio” (2003), and how Pears used the idea of time as the framework for his story.Between those two novels, Pears drew upon his background as an art historian to begin what became a series of seven “art history mysteries:” “The Raphael Affair,” “The Last Judgment,” “The Titian Committee,” “Death and Restoration,” “The Bernini Bust,” “Giotto’s Hand” and “The Immaculate Deception.” The books are wonderful mysteries, and you learn about the art and the art world at the same time you’re enjoying a good story.Pears has also written the novel “The Portrait” (2006) and “The Discovery of Painting: The Growth of Interest in the Arts in England, 1680-1768.”In 2010, Pears published ”Stone’s Fall,” which I have finally gotten around to reading. Here, rather than drawing upon his knowledge of and experience with art, he utilizes his experience as a journalist (BBC, Reuter’s and others) and creates a story about the world a few years before World War I. Almost like an investigative journalist, Pears leads the reader down a path of armaments manufacturing, the Industrial Revolution, international finance and diplomatic intrigue.But even more than that, he takes us back in time, from London in 1909 to Paris in 1890 and Venice in 1867, telling his story in almost reverse chronological order.In 1909, in his London home on St. James Square, 68-year-old businessman John Stone falls out of a window to his death. The police conclude it was an accident, that Stone tripped on a carpet in front of the window and fell. No one wants to consider suicide, because Stone is the center of an industrial armaments empire that stretches globally, and his shareowners include people at the highest levels of the British government.Stone’s considerably younger wife Elizabeth hires a something journalist, Matthew Braddock, to ostensibly write a biography of her late husband but actually to discover the identity of the child mentioned in Stone’s will. The will doesn’t give a name, gender or age, but there is some 250,000 pounds left to “the child.” As he investigates, Braddock stumbles into Stone’s web businesses and business / political relationships. The young Braddock also falls in love with the considerably older Elizabeth Stone.The story moves backward to Paris in 1890, with a tale of intrigue spun to bring down the Bank of England. But even then, the story has murkier antecedents, in the Venice of 1867, and the creation of the torpedo and adulterous relationships among the English ex-pat community.Similar to what he did in “The Dream of Scipio,” Pears uses time as a major structuring device for the novel. By essentially telling the story backwards, he employs the line from William Wordsworth, “The child is father to the man.” The great events and the individual lives of today owe much to the past, even if and especially when we don’t realize it. In “Stone’s Fall,” that line is almost literally true, but the child mentioned in the will becomes the key to what happens over the next 40 years.It’s a captivating read, and another great story by the author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HSO1Y6XPJLVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NLL0JA#wasThisHelpful","R2HSO1Y6XPJLVW","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As Douglas Boin notes in “Coming Out Christian in the Roman World: How the Followers of Jesus Made a Place in Caesar’s Empire,” Christianity didn’t just “emerge” legally with the Emperor Constantine at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 A.D. Nor was Christianity the cause of the empire’s fall, as Edward Gibbon (and others) argued. The story is more complex,and Boin takes a painstaking view of rather disparate events and people from all over the Roman world to help explain what happened.An assistant professor of Ancient and Late Antique Mediterranean History at Saint Louis University, Boin received a B.A. in Classics from Georgetown University and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Classics from the University of Texas at Austin. He’s does extensive archaeological research at Ostia, once the seaport for the city of Rome.He relies upon the writings of the early church fathers Tertullian, Cyprian, Ignatius of Antioch, among many others; original Latin / Roman sources, including like Tacitus, Trajan, and Cicero; and Jewish sources like 2 Maccabees and Philo of Alexandria. He ranges the empire, from Ostia and Rome to Alexandria and what is now Iraq.And he goes beyond the period of Constantine and Christianity’s legalization, coming to the question of how Christianity, once an illegal and unpatriotic “cult,” managed to outlaw traditional Roman and other religions within a century of its own legalization (Ambrose of Milan, a figure connected to St. Augustine, plays a significant role in influencing imperial policy).“Coming Out Christian” is an academic work but written in an accessible, sometimes almost entertaining style. And because it’s an academic work, and not a theological one, Boin does not accept traditionally ascribed authorship of a number of parts of the New Testament.I find it a valuable book, not the least reason being how contemporary scholarship is employed to understand ancient questions and events.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZBUMKUBU1DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWZXYO4#wasThisHelpful","R3PZBUMKUBU1DC","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prayer and writing may spring from the same spiritual impulse. They are certainly related, both being “leaps in the dark” – prayer may be met with ongoing silence and writing can be met with – ongoing silence, too. Both are certainly acts of faith, and say as much about ourselves as believers and writers as they do to God or the readers we are directing ourselves to.Ed Cyzewski’s ""Pray, Write, Grow: Cultivating Prayer and Writing Together"" recognizes the relationship of prayer and writing for those of us who are Christians and writers. What he has created here is a kind of expanded devotional for writers, a work deliberately designed to stop us in our frenzied lives of cramming writing (and prayer) into every spare moment, of which there are few.The book is divided into seven chapters: “Creating Space to Pray and Write;” “Learning to be Present;” “Do You Want to be Made Well;” “Breaking Through with Self-Awareness;” “Discernment Through Prayer and Writing;” “We Pray and Write by Faith;” and “Getting Started,” quick resource guides for both prayer and writing. It is a simple work. What strikes me even more than its simplicity is its gentleness. Cyzewski is gentle with his readers, which suggests we should be gentle with ourselves. It is not a daily Bible study, but rather a discussion we need to have with ourselves if we intend to grow in both our prayer time and our writing.Cyzewski has written several works in the area of faith, including ""Hazardous: Committing to the Cost of Following Jesus;"" ""A Christian Survival Guide;"" and ""Unfollowers: Unlikely Lessons on Faith from Those Who Doubted Jesus.""""Pray, Write, Grow"" is full of helpful counsel for Christian writers. And Cyzewski has the order exactly right: first we pray, then we write, and then we grow. And we grow in both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IOWH02ENF3SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TABE8R6#wasThisHelpful","R3IOWH02ENF3SK","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I walked into the middle of a retelling of the legend of King Arthur, and I almost couldn’t put the book down. It’s too detailed a story how I came to a trilogy of books by reading the third, and it really doesn’t matter.“Merlin’s Nightmare” by Robert Treskillard is better than a good book. It’s a great story, a believable story, one written for young adults but it can be read and enjoyed by almost all ages.It is the 490s in Britain. The Romans have been long gone. The Britons are having to defend themselves against what turns out to be an invasion by the Picts in the north and the Saxons in the southeast. Merlin has been raising his family – his wife, Natalenya, and their two natural children and their adopted son, Arthur, who is 18 and is known as Artorius. Arthur, the son of the slain high king Uther, is supposed to be dead. Arthur does not know his lineage. The family lives with others in a secluded, rather secret valley, not far from the northern border.Quickly Treskillard develops three story lines – war with the Saxons, the siege of Merlin’s valley by the Picts, and the plans of Merlin’s sister Morgana, who is seeking to reinstall the supremacy of the Druids and employs magic, bewitched men and large wolves to attain her ends. Within the three story lines are two interrelated themes – the Arthur legend before it was a legend and the battle between pagan Druidism and Christianity.Treskillard excels with the battle scenes (of which there are many). The reader is right there on the field, splattered with the blood and gore of often ferocious battles and smelling the hot breath of the wolves on the back of one’s neck as they do Morgana’s bidding.The characters are recognizably human. Merlin is not the Hogwarts-like wizard of The Sword in the Stone or Camelot; he is a flawed man of middle years, a devout Christian eventually forced to take the sword and fight. Arthur is a rather reckless youth of 18 who is forced to grow up very quickly. Morgana is pure evil, and the skin crawls as she manipulates men and events.“Merlin’s Nightmare” is volume three of The Merlin Spiral Trilogy. The first volume is “Merlin’s Blade,” and the second is “Merlin’s Shadow.” A summary of the first two volumes is included in the third, and the entire set is available on Kindle as “The Merlin Spiral Trilogy.” A successor trilogy is planned, entitled “The Arthur Spiral Trilogy.”It’s a wonderful series, with good yet flawed men (and women) having to face and fight a growing evil that is both military and spiritual.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZPCYH3NJCR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310735092#wasThisHelpful","R3TZPCYH3NJCR2","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may rank as one of the most unusual collections of poetry I’ve ever read. At first, I thought I was headed down the rabbit hole with Alice. Then the poems began to make a Wonderland kind of sense. And then the collection became something almost profound.I never would have thought I would have used the word “profound” in describing 46 poems written about rapper Kanye West (who may be equally famous as the husband of Kim Kardashian as he is for rap music).But that’s what poet Sarah Blake did. She wrote 46 poems as a kind of unauthorized biography of the singer. She wrote 46 poems that are also about her non-relationship with the singer. I suspect that’s why she entitled the collection ""Mr. West"" instead of something less formal.Apparently, Mr. West and his people were not pleased. Perhaps they didn’t understand what she did. Or perhaps they did.The poems are not a send-up or a satire. This is serious poetry. Blake employs one of the icons of popular culture and does what poets, good poets, are able to do. She makes us see something familiar in a very different, perplexing and ultimately uncomfortable way. In others words, she makes us see ourselves.The Week Kanye Joined TwitterWe find there are fewer dinosaurswhen we learn how the skulls age.Shifting horns, bones that thinand smooth, holes that form likesome desires do. Changes wecouldn’t anticipate, knowing mostlyour simple, fusing domes.  You begin tweeting.I learn about your suits, videos,jets, pillows, the new words youpicked up overseas. You takea picture of your diamondand gold teeth. You make a jokeabout a crown so lovely I seeit on nymphs in daydreams.  Sometimes I seemy curly head of hair outlined inthe morning dark and think I’mthe lovechild of actresses and lions.But today I see the functionalityof my face and not whetherI’m beautiful. I’m so very animal.I remember and flare my nostrils.Blake received a masters degree in creative writing from the University of Texas, and her masters of Fine Arts in Poetry from Penn State University. Her poetry has been published in the Michigan Quarterly Review, FIELD, Sentence, and The Threepenny Review. She’s editor of Saturnalia Books, poetry editor for MiPOesias, and co-founder of Submittrs. And she has a special passion for arts administration.Yes, the poems in ""Mr. West"" are about Kanye West. But they tell us more about ourselves, in this age of social media, instant celebrity, and being famous for being famous (Andy Warhol would have been fascinated with Kardashians, I think). We identify with the gods and goddesses of popular culture to an almost frightening degree. Their utterances are quotable and tweetable, and we quote them and tweet them. If they like a particular kind of food, then so do we. We imitate their fashion styles and their hairdos, and we listen worshipfully to their music.This is the culture Blake addresses in ""Mr. West."" She uses herself as our representative and she follows everything he’s doing while she herself is actually (and really) expecting a baby. His life and media clips become vicariously enmeshed with hers. And ours.Yes, the poems are about him, but they’re even more about us. The collection is brilliant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PQN923E7Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S66PURS#wasThisHelpful","R37PQN923E7Z5","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year, Jessica Goodfellow published “The Insomniac’s Weather Report.” She has a new collection this year that’s even more engaging, “Mendeleev’s Mandala.” It’s about pilgrims, and time, and science, and self-improvement projects, among other things, with sharply defined images that grab your attention and hold it.Here is one of the poems about time.A Metronome is the Opposite of WindWind launches the laundry, shakes handswith a scarecrow, shuffles rust-edged petalsof dogwood, hungry for anything hung,dangled, crucified. Who do you—or maybeHoodoo you. She calls, passing. The wind isa woman, we say, when a thing disappears;a man, when a thing is demolished.I’ve come to the field today to beaway from metronome, clock, and door—instruments of opening and closing, doing,undoing, redoing. The wind is no one’sinstrument; it opens and opens, which is whyit cannot stay. Once you made me a giftof a metronome, saying, Without symmetry,there’d be too much to desire. What your rule forgetsis the human heart’s four unequal chambers,left of center. But its valves close and open,its throbbing is even, metronome in give-and-takewith wind. Or vice versa. No one’s wholly satisfied,or wholly dispossessed, in this elliptical ruin of breath.The 12 poems that comprise the “time” section of the collection (section two) are particular favorites. Included in the 12 are poems about a candle clock, a sundial, an hourglass, the invention of the clock face, and even a list of words a blind man’s wife must no longer use (and, yes, it’s about time).Goodfellow has published two previous collections and received a number of awards. She currently works at a university in Japan. “Mendeleev’s Mandala” is an intriguing collection. If it’s an indication of future work, we have some great poetry to look forward to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MIHUYD6LCH7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936419491#wasThisHelpful","R2MIHUYD6LCH7N","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was selected for The New York Times Book Review’s Ten Best Books of 2014. It was a National Book Award finalist. Almost 13,000 reviews on Amazon. And it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Usually I see that kind of recognition for a book and expect to be disappointed when I read it. Not this time.

He has also created a wooden model of the neighborhood for his blind daughter to eventually find her way around. Her birthday presents are usually small puzzle boxes with candy inside. As Marie-Laure grows older, her father takes her to work, where she meets the scientists and museum curators, and learns about mollusks. She also receives a Braille edition of part one of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne.Werner Pfennig and his sister Jutta are raised in an orphanage near Essen, Germany. Werner is small for his age but can do incredible things with his hands, like create radio receivers from scraps of metal and tubing. He builds a radio, and one of the programs he and his sister listen to at night comes from somewhere in France. The programs are about science, and Werner and Jutta become enchanted. It is how he learns French, and the wonder of what he hears will change him forever.But this is 1930s Europe. The Nazis are consolidating power in Germany and creating the Reich that will last a thousand years. And persecuting Jews and others who don’t belong to the master race. Werner’s technical skills comes to the attention of local Nazi officials, and he eventually finds himself, the boy who builds radios, at an elite Nazi school for training Germany’s youth.With the fall of France in June 1940, Daniel and Marie-Clare flee westward from Paris, with a place supposedly found for them with one of the museum’s governors. When they arrive, they find the house in flames and being looted by locals. Daniel then takes his daughter to St. Malo in Brittany, where his Uncle Etienne lives. Etienne has not been in his right mind since World War I, and refuses to leave the six-story family townhouse. And then the Germans arrive.What Daniel tells no one is what he is carrying with him, one of three replicas of a famous diamond in the museum’s collection. Or it may not be a replica. No one knows for sure, including Daniel, and that’s by design. A Nazi official, however, will spend years tracking down the stone and its copies, seeking to claim it for the Reich.Doerr moves the story back and forth over a ten-year period, 1934 to 1944, underscoring how much the past has to do with the present, and the future. And while the suspense of the story is important, it’s not what the novel is ultimately about. It is about the things that matter, the small and seemingly insignificant things. Wars and thousand-year reichs may swirl around us, but there is still beauty in the natural world and beauty in the relationships we build and sustain. That is what lasts, even after life itself is gone.""All the Light We Cannot See"" is a marvelous book, a beautiful book. I held back the tears until the very last chapter, and I don’t know whether the tears came because of the story itself or the fact that I had reached the end.Perhaps it doesn’t matter. A book like this never really ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEI8TN169DEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7TIG#wasThisHelpful","R2GEI8TN169DEM","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those of us who live in urban and suburban areas are becoming more familiar with wildlife not normally associated with the neighborhood. Animals (especially deer) are finding ways to adapt to the encroachment of development. In my own area of suburban St. Louis, I have seen coyotes, opossums, raccoons and foxes (rabbits don’t count as wildlife).""The Adventures of an Urban Fox: Maggie Arrives"" by Yara Evans is a delightful children’s book, the story of an urban (or suburban) fox who begins showing up around the yard, driving two cats to complete distraction.

"Artist and writer Makoto Fujimura has published “On Becoming Generative: An Introduction to Culture Care,” a special preview to his soon-to-be-published book “Culture Care.” It’s a short work, some 25 pages, but it’s packed with the thinking of an artist who’s been considering ad writing about the idea of “making culture” for a number of years.The preview includes a short personal storu about bringing beauty into our lives; a longer essay on “An Artist’s Journey Toward Generativity;” and then a discussion of what “culture care” actually is. Fujimura defines the purpose of culture care providing “care for our culture’s ‘soul,’ to bring our cultural home our bouquet of flowers, so that reminders of beauty—both ephemeral and enduring—are present in even the harshest environments where survival is at stake.”The preview promises that the complete book will be thought-provoking, insightful, and an artifact of “culture making” itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CLE9NDGLPNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXMVHLA#wasThisHelpful","R30CLE9NDGLPNN","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve ever wondered how much book publishing has changed over the last decade, here’s a good place to start. “Advanced Kindle Book Marketing: How to Sell More Ebooks Online with New Amazon Promotions and Bestseller Tips” by Lucinda Sue Crosby and Laura Dobbins. This is not so much about how to publish an ebook generally or how to publish a Kindle book, but rather how to develop marketing strategies and plans specifically selling books via Kindle (whether they’re original Kindle books or Kindle versions of hardcover or paperback books).Crosby and Dobbins go extensively through the basics: from keywords and book categories to promos, book reviews and using social media. One chapter includes good information on the strategic use of “free days,” those times when you (or your publisher) can, or should, offer your book for free. It’s not as obvious or as simple as you think it might be.Remember that the book is strictly about ebook marketing on Kindle and Amazon, and it’s exhaustive in that regard. You’ll need to seek other resources if you’re looking for a book on how to publish an ebook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T07URNDQIPC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N95USFU#wasThisHelpful","R1T07URNDQIPC9","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bank (short for Bancroft) Jonsson is your rather typical high school sophomore. He’s tall – six foot four – and but not coordinated (or interested) enough to play basketball. He’s interested in girls but tends to get clumsy around them. He’s just gotten his driver’s license. And his best friend has just moved from their small Oklahoma town to Minnesota, and Bank is feeling the separation.Oh, and his mother, Meredith, has distributed (or dissociative) identify disorder, meaning her body is occupied by numerous personalities. If you’ve seen the 1957 movie The Three Faces of Eve with Joanne Woodward or the 1976 movie Sybil with Sally Fields,  you’ll know what DID is. It’s a difficult disorder, not the least of which for the fact a cure is not known. Patients can be cured, but there’s no set path for that to happen.Bank, a normal teenager living not quite the normal teenager’s life.  He’s become rather expert at identifying which personality has emerged at any given time. He also recognizes that new student at his high school has DID.Jill Case Brown’s young adult novel “Safe” is the story of Bank, his family, and his friends. Brown tells a fine story, a story that respects both its teenaged characters and the teenagers who will read it. I stayed wrapped up with the book almost start to finish; it was that difficult to put down.What happens is that none of Bank’s friends really understand what DID is, and that leads to a succession of events that are life-threatening. Bank becomes the target of misunderstanding and meanness by one of his former friends. And his schoolmates turn against him.Brown catches the scene and substance of life in a high school just right, with all of the emotional highs and lows (often at the same time), hopes, dreams and fears common to any high school experience.For Bank, though, the experience is anything but common. Brown gets the reader inside his head, and inside his heart.“Safe” is simply a wonderful story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CB731BLSO647/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6X7R54#wasThisHelpful","R2CB731BLSO647","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christian publishing is uncomfortable with certain fiction genres, what’s generally called “speculative” but includes science fiction, paranormal, and horror. And yet some of the most successful speculative writers, like Stephen King, acknowledge the presence of Biblical imagery throughout many of their works.For a number of years, Mike Duran, author of a number of Christian horror story collections and novels, has written about Christian publisher’s reluctance to embrace anything in speculative fiction. Publishers know their audiences, however, and is to the audiences that Duran now turns his attention. ""Christian Horror: On the Compatibility of a Biblical Worldview and the Horror Genre"" makes a solid case why Christian readers’ attitudes toward the horror genre is misguided and possibly dangerous.Duran has written an apologetic for the horror genre in Christian fiction, and it’s an impressive piece of work. And he lays claim for horror some of the most famous works in Western literature.“Many have suggested,” he writes, “that the epic poem Beowulf is one of the earliest horror stories ever written. Possibly the oldest surviving long form in Old English, Beowulf is often cited as one of the most important works of Old English literature. Though the story is in essence a pagan myth, most believe it was originally written down by a Christian monk who incorporated Christian elements into the text.”He doesn’t stop with Beowulf. He also makes a convincing case for Christian elements being incorporated into Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,  H.G. Wells’ The Invisible Man and especially Bram Stoker’s Dracula, a work in which there is nothing subtle about Christian influence. And then there is the Bible itself, filled with any number of horrific stories.Duran examines religious themes in horror and horror themes in religion; how the evangelical culture has in general responded to the horror genre; what he terms “toward an apologetic” for Christian horror; and the main objections Christians voice against horror and similar genres.I don’t ready much in the horror genre, but I’ve read books by Duran, Mike Dellosso, and T.L. Hines, among others, and I have found the quality of the writing and stories to be at least equivalent to if not considerably better than much of what’s published in mainstream Christian fiction.And Duran is right: it doesn’t always have to be an Amish romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRJKIJXW4PMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XA61CSU#wasThisHelpful","R1YRJKIJXW4PMB","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s been sitting on my bookshelf for a while, unread, this book by mystery writer Elizabeth George. I know why it’s been sitting – a book of 723 pages requires serious commitment. It was a gift from my wife, who knew I liked the Inspector Lynley mysteries.A couple of weeks ago, I pulled it from the shelf, and began to read, hoping that I wouldn’t like it so I could put it back on the shelf. The story of “Just One Evil Act” begins with a women’s roller derby in London, of all things. I wasn’t hooked from the first page; the first few pages are about a potential new love interest for Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, an earl of the realm who happens to work for Scotland Yard. His wife Helen had been rather senselessly killed in a previous novel (and I still don’t think I’ve forgiven the author for that).By page 15, however, when Lynley finally returns a frantic phone call from his erstwhile Scotland Yard partner Sergeant Barbara Havers, I’m fully pulled into the story, and ready to tackle another 708 pages.Barbara’s good friend and neighbor Taymullah Azhar is desperate – his daughter Hadiyyah has been taken – kidnapped – by her mother Angelina. Azhar had returned from work at a London university microbiology lab to find his daughter and her mother gone, Hadiyyah’s room stripped clean. Azhar had never married Angelina; in fact, he had left his wife and family to live with her. His daughter is his world and his family, and now she’s disappeared.This begins a story that moves constantly between London and Lucca, Italy; between the police investigations in both countries; between private detectives in both countries; and between a multitude of related side stories and a relatively large cast of characters. It is a feat to pull all of this off in one coherent mystery, but George does it, and does it incredibly well. It would have been an easy book to lose the reader’s way in, but it never happens; it’s that well-written of a story.The mother’s kidnapping of Hadiyyah goes somewhat awry when the girl is really kidnapped in one of Lucca’s open-air markets; the strong passions on all sides eventually results in a murder. The Italian policeman Salvatore LoBianco, a somewhat Italian counterpoint to Lynley, manages to continue a competent investigation in spite of an ogre of a boss who’s more concerned with the political than the criminal. Their characters and relationship is a good example of how well George creates and develops characters.What makes the story even more compelling is watching Barbara Havers spin herself into a deeper and deeper hole, almost determined to break every written and unwritten rule in helping Azhar. She leaks to a tabloid reporter; she hides what she’s doing; she lies, even to Lynley. You read with increasing anxiety as her career is headed for what looks to be the inevitable crackup.Any other who can keep a reader going for more than 700 pages knows how to tell a good story. “Just One Evil Act” is just possibly Elizabeth George’s best mystery novel to date, and that should be taken as a high compliment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPZ0V0HTGE0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525952969#wasThisHelpful","R1CPZ0V0HTGE0U","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her latest poetry collection “Here Versus Elsewhere,” Allison Carter tackles the idea of ghosts, not in the conventional understanding but in the sense of echoes of spaces or white space, the ghosts of what has happened that continue to shape the experience of the here and now.Experimenting with both length (some long, some short) and form (one is entirely prose poems), Carter explores these ghosts of sound and shape in 49 poems. One example is “Intimacy, These Days,” and watch how her effective use of repetition creates echoes.Intimacy, These DaysFamiliar as the backwall of a cat’s eyeFamiliar as the eyesight of the gentle fishin the fish fountainand its orange perception of the skythrough the ceiling of airThe rope that chafes hangsfrom real stomach to real stomach soMy expectations of knowing are scaling backscaling backMy expectations of making love are scaling backscaling backMy expectations of speaking out are scaling backscaling backMy expectations of dreaming are fading to blackfading to blackShe is the author of several poetry collections, including A Fixed Formal Arrangement, Sum Total, All Bodies Are the Same and Have the Same Reactions, and Shadows Are Weather.

"Writer Wendell Berry is known for many things – poetry, novels, short stories, essays, his longstanding opposition to what he calls industrial agriculture, his regional depictions of Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley. Berry is not generally known as a children’s poet, although his poetry, especially his poems about the natural world, have a childlike simplicity and appeal about them.For years, illustrator Tom Pohrt had been gathering those Berry poems that might appeal to children. Pohrt had written and illustrated numerous children’s books, including Crow and Weasel by Barry Lopez and Careless Rambles by John Clare, both selections of their writings or poems that might appeal to children. A correspondence between Pohrt and Berry began, long-time Berry book designer David Bullen joined in, and the result was “Terrapin and Other Poems.”The book is slender at 49 pages, and contains only 21 poems, small for an adult poetry book. But the poems, with Pohrt’s illustrations, are a marvel. You look at the natural world with the wonder and sometimes quiet awe of a child.Consider something as simple as a group of finches.The FinchesThe ears stung with coldsun and frost of dawnin early April, comesthe song of winter finches,their crimson bright, thendark as they move intoand then against the light.May the year warm themsoon. May they soon gonorth with their singingand the seasons to follow.May the bare sticks soonlive, and our minds go freeof the groundinto the shining of trees.What beings as a simple observation – finches in the cold morning hours of early spring – becomes both an anticipation of the warming season and an identification with the natural world” “…and our minds go free / of the ground / into the shining of trees.” Berry effectively uses simple language here (no word is longer than two syllables) to highlight the essential beauty of an early April morning.The poems cover a range of natural subjects – a squirrel, a snake, a horse, a calf, the woods, a late snow, seasons, the planting of trees. Each uses simple language; each communicates a sense of quiet and wonder. “My Nose,” which I suppose can be described a poem about the natural order, is the kind of funny poem that would appeal to children (while we adults we smile and murmur at the idea of calling someone’s nose an onion or a carrot).The illustrations by Pohrt match that sense of quiet and wonder exactly. The pictures contain an innocence, much like the innocence of the poems.“Terrapin and Other Poems” is a beautiful book, designed for children and the child in all of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BB2LYOOXSQU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWT0OCQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BB2LYOOXSQU7","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like English history, and especially the history of the Plantagents and the Crusades, a novel is waiting for you.Justin Cartwright’s “Lion Heart” is about memory, history, generational influence, and love, all wrapped together in an intriguing story.Richard Cathar didn’t speak to his father for the last ten years of his father’s life.  His father, Alaric, was something of a career hippie (drugs and all), who became addicted to the story of the Crusades and Richard the Lionhearted. When Richard’s live-in girlfriend Emily leaves him (she says she needs her space but her space is with an English professor), he begins to poke around Richard the Lionhearted’s story, and the Plantagenet king’s fixation on recovering the true cross of Christ from Saladin. The cross, discovered by Helena the mother of Constantine in the 300s, had fallen into Saladin’s hands with the capture of Jerusalem.Richard’s research takes him to Oxford, where he earned his degree, to Jerusalem and back again. In Jerusalem, he meets and falls in love with a Canadian journalist, who is something other than a journalist. She travels to Cairo, ostensibly to report on the Arab spring, but is kidnapped. Richard manages to stay barely sane by continuing his research. He finds a letter, which suggests Saladin gave Richard the cross. But where did it go?The novel is essentially three stories in one: Richard and his research, and how the ghost of his father lingers well into the present; Richard the Lionhearted, his battles, and what night have happened to the cross; and Richard’s love affair with the journalist. What author Cartwright does is to merge three stories into one story.Cartwright, a native of South Africa who makes his home in Britain, is an accomplished author of some 15 previous novels and three non-fiction works. Educated at Trinity College, Oxford, his novels have received numerous awards and been shortlisted for both the Man Booker Prize and Whitbread Novel Award.“Lion Heart” tackles questions of memory and history, how they connect and how they shape each other. The historical accounts are every bit as good as the contemporary accounts. Cartwright uses both to explain how a son comes to understand the father he barely knew and, by extension, himself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NOJGJ9PTQJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGKRZG0#wasThisHelpful","R29NOJGJ9PTQJO","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Fight Back with Joy: Celebrate More, Regret Less. Stare Down Your Greatest Fears” by Margaret Feinberg is a book that stays with you.It finishes with “Bonus Tracks” – “5 Things to Say When You Don’t Know What to Say,” applicable not only to a cancer patient but also to any serious situation; “8 Things Those Facing Crisis Can’t Tell You (But Wish They Could);” “6 Lessons I Learned from Crisis;” “A Letter from Leif,” Feinberg’s husband and chief caregiver; and a playlist of music to accompany each chapter.Each of the tracks (well, perhaps not the playlist) could have been books. Instead, they’re short, succinct summaries, wisdom learned the very hardest way – the wisdom that comes from living an experience that at many points could have ended in death.It was the bonus tracks, in fact, that punched home something I knew from the beginning of the book but which I don’t think I acknowledged. Books are objects, yes, objects you hold in your hands or view on an e-reader like Kindle. You enjoy them or you don’t; you learn from them or you don’t. Good books become part of you; the best books change your life.:Fight Back with Joy” is a giving book. Feinberg gives away a good part of herself in this book. One of the lessons she learned from her fight with breast cancer is that serious illness changes you. She may have been a giving person before it; she is a different giving person after it, a person who gives with God’s sense of giving.It is a generous book. That’s not a redundant statement. Feinberg is lavish with her giving in this book. Little is excluded. If you want to know what experimental chemotherapy is like, or what to expect when you first look in the mirror after a double mastectomy, you will find it here. Or what you experience when you hair falls out in clumps.You want to know how difficult a cancer fight is for the primary caregiver, you will find that, too.It is an honest book. Feinberg gets angry. She gets angry with God, with friends who don’t know what to say so they stop coming around, with her family, and with herself. There were days and times when she wanted to curl up in a ball and die.It is a courageous book. Even being on the other side of the cancer experience, and having survived the cancer, its treatment, and related surgeries, it is clear that Feinberg never quit, although there were times when she wanted to. She fought, she fought with everything she had, everything her husband had, what friends and family had. She fought, too, with what God had, and what He had from the beginning was no guarantee she would survive. She fought with faith.And “Fight Back with Joy” is a profoundly human book. Feinberg made a choice early on in dealing with the disease. She would fight with joy. There were days when there was no joy left, and yet it was still there. One of those days, when she found despair, led her to give away red balloons to fellow cancer patients and their families. She discovered the joy again, enough to continue the fight. And it is often the joy of a child, an adult who learns the joy of being a child of God.This is a book for those who suffer a serious illness, and those who don’t. This is a book for caregivers to learn what to expect, and for those who are never called upon to be caregivers. This is a book for women and for men. It is about shock, and fear, and joy, and depression, and despair, and faith, and giving in, and fighting on when there’s little left to fight with.This is a book that will change you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRL6J8HG0JUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHWTUTU#wasThisHelpful","R3FRL6J8HG0JUO","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 75 poems by Katherine Hoerth in “Goddess Wears Cowboy Boots” (which should win a prize for best poetry title of the year) are rooted in childhood and East Texas, and yet surpass being classified only as “regional poetry.” Some of the poems tell stories, and especially those about childhood and its memories – catching crawdads with other children; grasshoppers attracted by canna lilies; a high school football game; sacking groceries at the local supermarket.And climbing a favorite tree, where she may have first became aware of her goddess tendencies:The Fig TreeIt was a solid tree, a place of shadeand quietness, that grew along the edgeof our property. I’d spend the summerafternoons there, scrape my legs while climbingup its branches to the highest limbthat’d hold my weight so I could be alone.Underneath that canopy of green,creation shook with every move I’d make:a rustling of foliage, tumbling fruits,the flapping wings of startled mockingbirds.The fig tree grew the perfect size for me,at ten, so I could feel like a god,when every other place felt far too vastto fill, like it was built for someone else.The branches curved against my back, the leavesreached to the sky to shield my nose from sunburn,and the figs, within an arm’s reach, ripeneddeep maroon just for my tongue to taste.Some of what Hoerth in “Goddess Wears Cowboy Boots” describes is surrounded with fondness, but there are the uglier, more difficult issues and events. But she casts a sharp, practiced eye on good and bad together, creating a collection (for a goddess, even a human one) that has depth and texture.Hoerth is also the author of a collection of short stories, “The Garden Uprooted,” published in 2012. I hope to see more of her poetry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24T156B5AUBHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991532112#wasThisHelpful","R24T156B5AUBHS","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Lewis is the author of several other collections of poetry, including “Animal Husbandry” (2008), “State of the Union” (2013), and “This Visit” (2014). In “How to be Another,” her exclusive use of the prose poem form for the 70 poems in the collection gives the volume an almost news documentary feel, as she considers all of the facets of relationships. “Say Something” is one example:Say Something Say the end is the beginning.

"Poet Claire Trevien uses a different and arresting image in “The Shipwrecked House.” The 44 poems included here should be read slowly and closely, or, actually, they have to be. Trevien uses language and words in unusual ways. While some of the scenes seem like a surrealist painting, the reader begins to understand that there’s a sub-text.In this poem, Trevien writes about what might not be an uncommon occurrence in a shipwrecked house.WhalesWhales lived under our house,making the hinges rock, splitting cups and cheeks.Stray socks melted in their comb-mouthstheir fins sliced through conversations,we found bones in our cups of tea.Most of the time they just wanted to playbounced against bookshelves, snorted leaks,three bodies across the room.No one believed me of course,the carpet looked too smooth to hide a mammal.At night, I’d listen to their songbeat through the floorboardslike slashes of headlights.For days they’d circle the housetake a dive into the cellar, press the doorbelland run, I’d sometimes forget then tripover the carcass of one beachedin the gutter.The poem is so straightforward, so matter-of-fact, about the “problem” of whales roaming around the house that the idea does seem entirely believable. It’s especially so when one begins to consider them metaphorically, those large issues and problems that keep singing through the floorboards, bouncing against bookshelves, and make themselves a nuisance in the hopes they’ll be dealt with.Trevien, a native of Brittany who lives in the UK, is editor of Sabotage Reviews and co-organizer of Penning Perfumes, a collaboration between poets and perfumers.“The Shipwrecked House” is a fascinating, original collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQUK2GE0G893/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908058110#wasThisHelpful","R3RQUK2GE0G893","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When is a marriage like a knot?Karen Paul Holmes is the author of ""Untying the Knot: Poems,"" a collection of 49 poems published in 2014 addressing a range of relationships but focused on the crumbling and dissolution of a marriage. These poems speak to deep pain, the emotional anguish that strikes at one’s very being when what one accepted as the given in one’s life becomes the taken away. The title poem, placed about halfway in the collection, talks of recriminations and the personal guilt that the victim in a failed marriage can experience.Untying the KnotWhy do knots form by themselves?In my blow dryer cord,cell phone charger,dog leashes.What Boy Scout crept into the darkto practice right over leftaround and through?And what of the sheepshank of worryin my stomach,muscles tied tense with monkey’s fists,hair tangled in little nooses?The twists and hitches in our relationship—who caused those?Should I have jumpedthrough one more hoopto tighten our ties,looped my love around upone more time?Like a rope,our marriage failed at the stress of a knotand frayed at the bitter end.The questioning becomes anger and self-defense. The anger in these poems emerges almost naturally, fueled by the betrayal of not only a husband but also by a best friend. The poet tries meditation retreats, writing hate letters, self-incrimination (“if only I had…”), even imagining a reality show for saving marriages. But eventually it comes to sitting at a mahogany table, signing papers. The poet doesn’t achieve internal peace, but she does eventually reach a kind of resolution.Holmes has an MA degree in music history from the University of Michigan but lives in Atlanta, After serving as vice president of marketing communications for ING, the financial services company, she became a freelance writer – and a poet. This is her first collection.The poems of ""Untying the Knot"" are painful in their honesty and candor. The knot indeed unravels, leaving – an untied knot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPHRI9NMCIUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHCEOMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GPHRI9NMCIUP","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You’re standing in the poetry section of a Barnes & Noble bookstore. You don’t usually read poetry, or fiction either, for that matter. But a book caught your eye; you pull it from the shelf, open it and begin to read.Without realizing it, a random act of browsing in a bookstore leads to you changing your life.The “you’ in question here was writer Rod Dreher, author of “The Little Way of Ruthie Leming” and “Crunchy Cons” and a writer for The American Conservative. The Barnes & Noble was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And the book was Dante’s The Divine Comedy.Dreher describes what happened in “How Dante Can Save Your Life: The Life-Changing Wisdom of History’s Greatest Poem.”And what a story it is.What a fascinating story it is. If you love poetry, and even if you don’t, this is a remarkable book.It’s a story about how Dreher worked through serious physical illness brought on by his family, himself, his and his family’s history, and the sense of place. He tells it so well that the reader beings to see in Dante what Dreher found, and more – the reader begins to recognize himself in the journey.Of all the things I expected from this book, that turned out to be the most surprising, although in retrospect, it shouldn’t have been. That’s what good writing does. And it says something about both Dante and Dreher, and Dreher’s candor, openness and vulnerability in telling a story that is often painful.With Dreher and reader for the journey is Dante, himself guided by the Roman poet Virgil.Dreher takes the scenes and lines that connected most with himself and the situation he was trying, and largely failing, to deal with. Along with his Orthodox priest and his therapist, he works his way through his own personal Inferno and Purgatorio. He doesn’t necessarily reach Paradiso (Dante does, however), but he does find healing.How Dante Can Save Your Life is a much larger story than one man’s journey. Dante is one of those writers not studied much any more – a dead, white, European male. While he often criticizes the church and the popes, he is very much in the Roman Catholic tradition. The Divine Comedy is a profoundly religious book – and that alone might be sufficient eliminate it from the curriculum.That is criminal. It’s one of the great works of Western literature. It will still be read and treasured long after the more contemporary and trendy stuff is forgotten. What Dreher does in his book is to explain how meaningful and important Dante is for many of the same things that bedeviled us in late medieval and early Renaissance times that still bedevil us today. For that is the genius of Dante and The Divine Comedy – the poet and his great work still speak to the human condition.The Divine Comedy has been translated by numerous authors and writers over the years, including Dorothy Sayers, Clive James, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and many others (and that’s just a few of the English translations; there are many others in other languages). Dreher prefers the translations by Robert and Jean Hollander and Mark Musa; the only translation I’ve read myself is by John Ciardi.Read How Dante Can Save Your Life, and you will read of how a great work literature helped guide one man on what was at times a harrowing, life-threatening journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L3NXGXVHE4WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GIBTC#wasThisHelpful","R2L3NXGXVHE4WE","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michalle Gould is a writer and poet who worked on the poems in “Resurrection Party” (2014) for some 15 years before publication. She currently works as a librarian in Los Angeles and is working on a novel set in England in the 1930s.As its title (and cover) might apply, the poems of “Resurrection Party” are about death, and specifically, the artistic imagination engaging the meaning of death. The poems have allusions to Shakespeare, Hardy, the Bible, Greek mythology, Dutch painting, John Donne, the science writer Lewis Thomas, Matisse and Michelangelo.Riddle on MetamorphosisTo be human is to be like a cloud chalked into the sky  that some eraser could sweep off the blue board at any  momentTo be immortal is to be solid as a pear in an old Dutch still life  that would choke you if you tried to swallow it, no matterhow small your bite.But what does it mean to be a cloud shaped like that pear?There are two kinds of sacredness often ascribed to a saint’s  body,either its lack of decay or its absence altogether from the graveAs you never see the skeleton, the clouds has no bones to rustlebut simply shifts: becoming a turtle or a tablet of bread, whose  pieces fallNot to feed but to instruct, naked an particular in shape as we  must learn to beIndeed, what does it mean to be shaped like a pear, and then change into a turtle or loaf of bread? Our short time on the planet is like that metamorphosis of the clouds.“Resurrection Party’s” poems have an almost mediaeval sense to them – literary, more formal, reading like an after-dinner entertainment read at local baron’s court.

"Jessica Goodfellow’s “The Insomniac’s Weather Report” was first published in 2011 but reissued in 2014 by Isobar Press (in Japan). It’s her middle volume of poetry; A Pilgrim’s Guide to Chaos in the Heartland was published in 2006 and Mendeleev’s Mandela in 2015.Her poems center on the natural elements like water, in all of its various forms and uses; and a series of 30 poems built around the idea of a fugue and its various definitions. In between are nine “flotsam and jetsam” poems; however, even calling the section that relates the poems to the water theme.Here is one of the water or weather-themed poems:RainThe insomniac flings pebbles at the clouds.He says they won’t stop following him.

(If you fail to keep secrets, you will burn.)No one can convince him otherwise.No one is awake.  (The patron saint of running waterFinally the rain runs itself dryover the closed eyes of the insomniac  is also the patron saint of silence.)The poems of “The Insomniac’s Weather Report” are filled with vivid and rich language; Goodfellow makes full use of the sounds of words to blend into the theme; one, entitled “Chance of Precipitation,” has words and structure that sound like a steady rain on a metal roof.

"It’s an arresting idea, and not easy to pull off: assemble a poetry collection around the idea of conception, pregnancy, and childbirth – not, however, like a child is conceived and born, but as a woman is constructed from childhood to adulthood.Welcome to “Birthing Inadequacy: Poems” by poet and writer Natasha Head.The works in the collection are a combination of poetry and short narratives. They are confessional in nature; “self-examined” is perhaps a better description. She recounts scenes from childhood and growing up, the accumulated experiences that, in both good and bad ways, contribute to whom we are as adults. Time is both telescoped and abandoned, because our collective experiences, traumas and delights remain with us, shaping actions and reactions.The poems and narratives are grouped in five sections: conception; first, second, and third trimesters; and afterbirth. They have the feel of an ongoing flow, always happening in the present. This is one from the “First Trimester” section:Dark MatterSlipstreamparticles collidetransferenceRealities mergecouplingsensing the potentialIs this the me you wish to seepropped up pedestaltrip the switchBlackness now as you ponderin the dark there is no sense of my selfwhich might influence your desireShortcut nowspace and time need pay no mindthe wormhole trumps their powerNow meek and mildno more girl gone wildyou knew that taste would sourPulsing waves distort my senseswhile you decidewhere you’ll mark your fencesCollar tight, the leash is snughave you determinedthis is love?Head grew up in Nova Scotia, now lives in Alberta.

"Jim Shalabon, co-lead of the now-defunct rock band Eyebeams, is in London to find out what happened to his other co-lead, Kirk Howell. Howell was found dead in a London alley; the cause was an overdose of drugs. A major problem with that determination is that Howell didn’t take drugs, ever. And found with the body is a copy of a poetry book by Shalabon’s father, an émigré Russian who settled in America, abandoned his family to return to Russia in the early 1980s, and died not long after.Thus begins ""Little God Blues"" by Jeffrey Anderson. While it is largely a murder mystery (Shalabon might be the first rock star detective), it is also a story about London, about rock music, and about the search for self.And there’s a romance, too.It might be easy to get lost in all of these threads, but Anderson is a wonderful storyteller. His cast of characters is large, and range from a Greek student studying physics, a former British spy suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease and a 13-year-old girl seeking her disappeared mother to an Oxford professor, assorted detectives from Scotland Yard, a barrister and a jailed felon. The story develops in pieces and hints, each one taking Shalabon deeper into the central mystery, which because three connected central mysteries – two deaths (from the same kind of drug overdose) and a disappearance.I was hooked from the first chapter.The novel isn’t entirely set in London; Shalabon makes a few side trips, like to Greece, his home of San Francisco, and St. Petersburg. But all the while he’s moving closer to what happened to his friend, and moving closer to understanding his own father, and, by extension, himself. And he’s falling deeply in love with a young woman whose father’s various business activities is scrutinized by police in several countries.Anderson’s novel is big, often complex but deeply engaging. You watch a formerly hedonistic rock star mature into something much more than that, as he learns at least some of what happened to his father. And while the central mystery is ultimately solved, not everything is answered. Much like life.Anderson is currently based in London, where he writes short stories and novels, but he’s originally from San Francisco and has degrees in economics and Russian from the University of California – Santa Barbara.A sequel to ""Little God Blues"" is due out shortly – if it’s half as good as this one it will be well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25NZWC098RXAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYE90V8#wasThisHelpful","R25NZWC098RXAI","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Deerslayer” is one of the five “Leatherstocking Tales” written by James Fenimore Cooper, with The Last of the Mohicans being perhaps slightly better well known, thanks to the 1992 Daniel Day Lewis movie. Cooper set his novels in central New York State, and today the region is known as “Leatherstocking Country.”It is also the region where poet Daniel Bowman Jr. was raised, and it provided the title for his first collection of poetry, A Plum Tree in Leatherstocking Country.Bowman, an associate professor of English at Taylor University in Indiana, has assembled 43 poems of geography and memory, some reaching into his childhood  and the people who shaped his life and others examining the seasons, poets, music and baseball (Cooperstown and its Baseball Hall of Fame are in Leatherstocking Country).The poems are accessible and immediate, originating in or influenced by particular place, but nonetheless familiar and engaging. They remind us that our own hometowns and regions continue to exert a powerful pull, even if left long ago for other places. These are the places that shape us, both because we were once part of a specific geography and a specific family.And these places can exert powerful influences upon our own children, even if they’ve never lived there. Here is Bowman’s “April Poem:”Every year about this timeI bury my mother’s bones.And in Maythey spring up as lilacsand in June they float softlyon the Irondequoit Creekand in July they march downColumbia Streetand end with smoke.In August they becomePoison Ivy creepingalong the trail where I walkwith my daughter.Soon they’ll be hiddenunder dead leaves and snow.The thaw will have its sayagain next yearand I’ll reach for the shovel,happy for moonlightand a grasshopper’s song.The poem speaks to many things – memory, family, the influences on succeeding generations, the circularity of daily life within the seasons. The flowers, springing from “my mother’s bones,” return each year. The idea of a natural order, outside but shaping human existence, permeates the words and phrases.Bowman’s poems have appeared in several books, including Tania Runyan’s “How to Read a Poem,” published by T.S. Poetry Press. He’s also written a novel, “Beggars in Heaven.”“A Plum Tree in Leatherstocking Country” is a beautiful collection, poems of quiet, reflection, and memory. The poems remind of the richness of the places we come from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FH1SPDIP99VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983009163#wasThisHelpful","R1FH1SPDIP99VQ","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To enter the world of Tania Pryputniewicz’s “November Butterfly: Poems” is to walk with Queen Nefertiti in ancient Egypt, Queen Guinevere in Camelot, and Joan of Arc as she makes an appearance in the 21st century. It is a collection that focuses on women, many famous but many not, but it also embraces notions of history, time, perception and understanding in intriguing and original ways.Pryputniewicz uses precise, simple words and phrases in her poems. This has the effect of focusing attention on the stories she’s telling, often across several related poems.For example, a full third of the collection is comprised of poems based on the legend of King Arthur, although none of them are about Arthur himself. Instead, Pryputniewicz writes about Guinevere, Morgan le Fay (or “Morgayne,” as she writes the name here), and Mordred, King Arthur’s nephew / illegitimate son. In Arthurian legend (first appearing in the account by Geoffrey of Monmouth of the kings of Britain), Mordred is a scoundrel and traitor, helping to upend Arthur’s kingdom when he forcibly marries Guinevere while Arthur is fighting in France.In “November Butterfly,” Pryputniewicz paints a different although not entirely contradictory picture, adding complexity to the simple account told by Geoffrey.Mordred’s Dream: A Refusal(Mordred to his mother Morgayne)I stand barefoot in the darkening woods,Your horse bears down. His hooves crescentthe dirt, casting rinds of Earth on my feetas he circles, one more animal bentto your will. From muscled halvesof his chest, heat radiates. Your slightboot and rim of cloak skim my cheek.I’m no hunter, mother, nor simple quarry, nor witchlike you. Guinevere paces her battlementsat dawn when Arthur’s gone, just a girlin pale slippers like falcon hoods,so lethal, so light. Were I to be mortallywounded, would Avalon’s ferryhalt for me? Unsmiling in your saddleabove, a planetary cold in your eyes,you begin your fade; outline of oak trunksreassemble in the air your horse occupied,the rowan fringe of your lips.In the poem, Mordred is refusing his mother’s demand that he betray Arthur. But the fact that the title indicates this is a dream, and the subtitle “A Refusal” doesn’t preclude a later acceptance, moves the figure of Mordred into a different place. He knows what she is asking is a terrible wrong, even if it is “only” a dream.Pryputniewicz is the managing editor at The Fertile Source, an online magazine devoted to topics related to fertility. While “November Butterfly” is her first published collection, her poetry has been published in numerous literary publications.She has also done work in what she calls “poetry montages,” combining a poem with music and photographs to create a rather hybrid type of art form, similar to but different from the three forms she draws from. This is a poetry montage for “Mordred’s Dream: A Refusal:”Not all of the poems in the collection deal with historical figures. The title poem, for example, takes its name from a butterfly caught on the windshield of a car, still alive, with its ragged wings and staring eye. It’s a haunting poem, one that lingers in the mind long after it’s read.“November Butterfly” does what often only poetry can do – take familiar subjects and rework them into a different (and intriguing) understanding. Many of those subjects are historical and the stuff of legends and myth; others are the common and everyday. But Pryputniewicz challenges our understanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBU00RNPIZ4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC9FC9O#wasThisHelpful","R3TBU00RNPIZ4U","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The late 1950s, before Rachel Carson and the environmental movement, before thalidomide, was a time when America still believed in itself and in technology. Only later would we come to understand that technology is a two-edged sword. It can bring great good; it can also bring unintended and unexpected consequences. The fire of Prometheus brought warmth and light; it also brought destruction. Technology is never neutral.Jeannine Hall Gailey grew up in one of the great centers of technology in America – Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Like its sister site at Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge was a focus of America’s atomic energy program. Gailey’s father was a professor at the University of Tennessee, and a consultant at Oak Ridge. Specifically, he consulted on robotic-based ways to clean up nuclear waste (this was not the 1950s; by the time Gailey lived in Oak Ridge, the problem of nuclear waste had long been recognized).Gailey did not grow up in a nuclear wasteland, despite the Geiger counter in the basement of her home; despite considerable poverty, Appalachian Tennessee was a place of considerable natural beauty. What she does in “The Robot Scientist’s Daughter,” her fourth collection of poetry, is to combine that natural beauty surrounded her childhood with the unnatural, destructive and often deadly effects of nuclear technology and research. That technology had its own kind of beauty, which she summarizes in the opening poem of the collection.Cesium Burns BlueCopper burns green, sodium yellow,strontium red. Watch the flaming lightsthat blaze across your skies, America—there are burning satelliteseven now being swallowed by your horizon,the detritus of space programs long defunct,the hollowed masterpieces of dead scientists.Someone is lying on a grassy hill,counting shooting stars,wondering what happenswhen they hit the ground.In my back yard in Oak Ridge,they lit cesiumto measure the glow.Hold it in your hand:foxfire, wormwood, glow worm.Cesium lights the rain,is absorbed in the skin,unstable, unstable,dancing away, ticking away,in bones, fingernails, brain.Sick burns through, burns blue.Many of the poems in the collection are entitled “The Robot Scientist’s Daughter,” with a parenthetical word of phrase to differentiate them, such as “villainess,” “medical wonder,” “triangulate,” “experiments in sleep deprivation,” and “brushes with death.” Some 20 of the poems are so entitled. But even those poems with different titles are also Gailey’s story of growing up near Oak Ridge, sharing that point-counterpoint of natural beauty and technology fallout. All of the poems are written in a narrative, almost journalistic fashion, bring with them a sense of news and urgency.Gailey’s previous books of poetry are “Becoming the Villainess,” “She Returns to the Floating World,” and “Unexplained Fevers.” She’s received a number of awards and prizes, and her poems have been published in American Poetry Review, The Iowa Review, Prairie Schooner, and other publications.“The Robot Scientist’s Daughter” is a remarkable, cohesive collection, built upon the same theme. It is a story of a unique childhood, and an American childhood. It is also the story of nature and technology, and the bargain we make between the two, often without fully understanding what we’re doing.It is indeed the fire of Prometheus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R383GVLXL434ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936419424#wasThisHelpful","R383GVLXL434ND","ASQW8Y9DY6LM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASQW8Y9DY6LM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great looking dinosaur but that is the only positive thing that I can say about it. It is not something that children can open themselves and even for an adult, the packaging is cumbersome, requiring strong hands and a wire cutter to extricate the beast.  There is no on-off switch so you can never quiet the him (the UPS person said that something was growling in the box) and (maybe blessedly) the batteries will drain quickly.  Battery replacement involves a Philips screw driver which is a nice safety feature and honestly, I would not bother replacing the batteries.  Labeling leads you to think that T-Rex actually stomps his foot, but that it not the case.  The dinosaur is articulated but minimally pose-able and there is a lot less movement than expected.  As for age appropriateness, 4-6 is about right.  The sound effects are initially interesting but by the end of the afternoon, the kids were pretty much done with it.  Hasbro could have skipped the batteries and stuck with a decent Jurassic Park inhabitant with voice overs by the children.

"I love the concept of naturally infusing flavors into my water and was happy to try this bottle out.The lid and flip top opening fit snugly with no leaking problems thus far.  There are textured indented grip areas on the sides which help prevent the bottle from slipping out of the hand.  This bottle is made of hard, clear plastic which hopefully will be durable over time.  The infuser basket is well designed, fits well and is easy to assemble.  The basket is in proportion to the 22 oz. container but the bottle is a bit  too compact for a good infusion.  Whatever little amount of fruit you stick in there has to be cut into tiny pieces and unless the fruit has a pretty noticeable flavor, it does not hold quite enough for my taste.  A handy recipe download is included which was helpful and I have had the greatest success adding leafy things like mint and fresh herbs.  One advantage of its size however is that it is great for kids even if you choose to go with straight water.  All in all it is a product that you can work with and adapt to a variety of needs.  I have had other products from this company and find them to be very responsive to customer needs and feedback.

"This combo apple slicer and corer is not a must have but does make preparing fruit a lot easier and safer for the fingers.  The rubber grips are comfortable and provide a little more protection from slippage than my all metal slicer.  It works well on any size of apple as long as it is not larger in diameter than the slicer itself but know that the smaller the apple, the larger the core you will get.  Neither this or my Pampered Chef slicer (which creates 10 smaller vs 8 larger pieces)  completely cuts the skin at the bottom but the pieces pop out with minimal nudging.

"The Dynamic Chef fish spatula is a versatile tool that should be in every kitchen even if you never prepare fish.  I have used it with salmon, perch and tilapia.  Narrower than other spatulas in my collection, it slides under the delicate fillet and lifts it without breaking up.  It is sturdy, flexible without being floppy and the slots allow any cooking liquid (great for poaching fish) to drain away.  It works equally well with fried eggs and my grandmother’s recipe for paper thin sugar cookies.  Because it is metal you cannot use it with non-stick cookware.

"I am a long term consumer of Coconut oil but have never purchased this brand.  I am using it for both cooking and skin care and have not been disappointed.  It has a distinct but not overwhelming coconut smell and adds a subtle overtone of sweetness to whatever I fry or saute. I have yet to try it in baked goods.  The label indicates that it becomes a solid below 77* but I have found that it needs to be significantly colder for this to happen.  To avoid spills and for ease of measurement, I keep it in the fridge and warm it up in the microwave till it is the consistency that I an looking for.  It is a little more expensive than the Viva lab brand  and lots more expensive that Natures Way, both of which seem to have comparable characteristics and are just as good.

"If you are looking for convenience, easy packing, simplicity of preparation and clean up, this may be the product for you.  The cook in bag is lightweight and opens with minimal effort.  I would definitely suggest stirring or shaking the bag half way through the reconstitution and found that we got better results if we added an extra minute to the process.  The meal was flavorful enough but tasted better with a hit of hot sauce.  Texture wise, the meat was inoffensive but did have the consistency that I would associate with thickish, wet particle board; it would never be confused for freshly cooked meat.  On the really down side, it is an expensive ($10/Bag) convenience.  The portions are small in terms of satiety and it would be reasonable to use two bags to feed 2-3 people  rather than the 5 that the bag advertises.

"This is not a scripture journal that appeals to me; possibly I am just not the right audience.  My experience is primarily with the NAB, Jerusalem and Message Bible translations, all of which seem to touch the soul of the contemporary reader more deeply than the CEB.  For people new to the practice of daily pondering and journaling, it seems a bit dry.  The passages are thematically related, followed by prompts that stop short of really engaging this user.  The book is nicely bound with a sturdy cover and is small enough to tuck into a a purse or book bag.  The downside to its small size is that the print is very very small and could prove difficult for older eyes to read and does not offer much in the way of writing space.

"We have tried quite a variety of coffee makers over the years and always return to the Mr. Coffee.  Their longevity varies (5 months- 5 years), but on a whole, they last proportionately as long as the more expensive models.  The difference between 10 and 12 cup capacity may appear insignificant but the ability to brew a larger pot is helpful in terms of time and efficiency.  The large opening on  reservoir is easy to fill and having the water level visible on the side is helpful.  We were using a Proctor Silex that requires filling the pot for  water measurement and then pouring it into the coffee maker and though it did not seem like an inconvenience at first, it was.  This is not a fancy coffee maker ~ no clock, timer or pre-set options ~ but honestly, all you really need is an on/off switch.  Because it does not have an automatic shut off mechanism, you do need to be attentive.  It is easy to clean and the black plastic does a pretty good job of hiding any coffee splashes.

Unlike other reviewers, I find this product very lacking in sweetness and if I did not see ""Peanut Butter"" on the label would be hard pressed to discern its presence.  After eating several of them, I have decided that  to some extent, Vega One bars may be an acquired taste although I am not sure that it will ever be a taste that I enjoy.  This product is not made in a dedicated factory so may contain traces of milk, rendering it legally but not ""ethically"" vegan.  Vega is in full compliance with the labeling requirements and for many Vegans, the potential trace is not enough to deter them from supporting a product that is in other ways free of animal product ingredients.

Because of the lighter color and the absence of any artificial coloring, the clean up when it does happen is pretty easy. The pieces are small and not overly hard which the older cat prefers.

"This is a lovely Pintrest type book with creative ideas but it despite the claim that these art projects are for kids, the skill and patience involved exceeds that of most children and many of their parents.  The author herself extends the caveat ""Many of the projects in this book can be made by kids but most will require careful adult supervision""  which puts these projects right smack in the world of what grown-ups want and need.  Old envelopes, empty boxes, calendar pages and newspaper along with card stock and construction paper are commonly found in most homes but for an outcome that remotely resembles the photograph, you also need a full complement of craft tools and the ""experience and disposition"" to use them.  If you and your children have the time, inclination and dexterity you might end up with a finished product that bears some resemblance to the pictures but you are running the risk of significant disappointment.  On a positive note, the book does suggest activities that will draw upon the child's own creativity and lived experience (cards, crowns, houses)  that can be done with minimal adult interference .  I am a firm believer in creative play and have found that left to their own devices children often have more fun with the box than anything it ever contained.  Skip the book, stock  up on markers, glue, scissors and duct tape, be there to to support their creative efforts.

"I have tried  to convince my family that whole wheat pasta is worth eating with little success over the years and although they were less turned off by the Barilla brand, they did not embrace it.  The shells are thinner than the competition but were not completely cooked at 7 minutes and had crossed the line to a pasty/mushy  consistency  by 9 minutes..  Whole grains have the benefit of being more complete nutritionally, but there are more palatable ways to incorporate them into the diet  without wasting a pot of good sauce on pasta that sticks to your teeth rather than to your ribs.

"Barilla Veggie pasta is a bit more hype than substance since the nutritional content will never measure up to eating actual vegetables.  If however you view it as a supplemental source, particularly for people who refuse to eat anything that resembles a carrot or spinach leaf, this is a nice addition to the meal. If you have vegetable suspicious eaters, there is a slight greenish cast to the pasta but covered up with sauce, they will not notice it.  It cooks up nicely within the time suggested on the box and holds up well with whatever topping you put on it.  Even when made into a baked casserole, the rotini held its shape without drying out.  As with most other pasta manufacturers, this is a 12 oz box instead of the 16 oz. packages of a few years ago so be sure to double check your recipe ahead of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYWUDJO6KCGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBKA6NM#wasThisHelpful","R1KYWUDJO6KCGN","A2D7X9N3IV3S7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D7X9N3IV3S7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For a quick and flavorful enough meal prep aid, this is a good product but not something that I would use often.  As with any processed ingredient, it is high in sodium and relatively high in calories.  We used the Sweet Onion version in the recipe that was on the package and people thought it was good but unexceptional.  My guess is that this flavor would best compliment ground beef but it might do well with chicken or pork depending on additional ingredients.  Cooking sauce is the latest darling of the marketing industry but to me, it is not a significant improvement over generic soup with some added spices.  Purchased in packages of 8 containers, it is reasonably priced and cheaper than some of the competition, though still more expensive than a can of soup.

"Wool socks have always sounded more appealing than they turn out to be in real life because regardless of their claims to the contrary, they always make me itch.

I line dry most of my clothes so am not sure how they would do in the dryer but machine wash without problem.  Sold as men's socks, they are advertised to fit women shoe sizes 8+ but I suspect that for women in the lower end of the size range, they would be too large.

"This is a cute novelty, not a toy so if you are expecting a sturdy item suitable for children to play with, keep on looking.  The plastic is thin and cheap but adequate for its intended purpose which is to hang on the wall, light up and give voice to phrases from the movie.  My niece is a huge fan of this movie and was thrilled to have Olaf in the bedroom.  Her mom was thrilled to have it there too because it does not take long for it to be pretty nerve grating for adults.  As far as serving as a night light, it really depends on how much brightness your child can tolerate and regardless of their devotion, may find it more of a distraction.  The greatest negative for me is the cost (big price tag, batteries not included)  which is way more than it is worth in terms of durability, duration of interest and life enhancement value.

"...this is a fine product.  The cubes are small, the serving size not huge but they are intended to add a bit of crunch and flavor to a meal rather than being the meal itself.  Comparing this product to bags of commercial salad croutons, the nutritional value is better and tossing a few on top of low fat yogurt adds interest without too much damage.

"I have been working with this product for several days and am ambivalent about it at best.  This is my first experience with a touch screen and with Windows 8 and I found that it is not quite as intuitive as I would like.  The manual relatively unimpressive and is completely picture driven, always referring the user to on line explanations.  The screen images are clear and bright and it is nicely sized.  The camera will handle both video and photos and this comes with a year subscription to Office Online which is a really nice feature. My problems started the second day.  Turning it on produced a time/date page only with no ability to sweep from any side or corner and no amount of tapping the Windows button brought up the start screen.  It would not turn off despite holding the on-off button down.  Despite the invitation to call or email ready and willing support staff, the phone call got me to an unidentified VM box and after 24 hours I have yet to receive a return email or hear anything from the on-line chat other than they would get back to me soon. The tablet comes with a keyboard case which you can plug into if you prefer a more traditional manner of use so I tried this approach to unfreeze the screen.  There is no explanation of keyboard usage in the manual and I could not navigate the screen.  Still searching for the ""mouse wheel"".  After hours of fussing with it, I shut it down by holding the off button for nearly 3 minutes.  Later I tentatively restarted it, the Windows start page came up and the touch screen works..  All in all, I have no sense of confidence in this tablet.  It takes an eternity to charge and does not hold it for the advertised 10 hours.  I am not a techno wizard but can manage a laptop, iPod, phone and Kindle relatively well and do not view this tablet as the kind of thing that should require  vast expertise to use.  I would not recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MM703O1HA6WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZVNOGK#wasThisHelpful","R1MM703O1HA6WV","A2D7X9N3IV3S7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D7X9N3IV3S7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Aprons are not a fashion accessory for me because I am genetically incapable of cooking without one.  Not only is this one pretty, it is well made and functional.  The fabric is heavy enough without being stiff and the contrasting pocket/ties add interest to the printed body.  It washes beautifully and so far does not hang onto the stains.  Unlike some mass produced aprons, this is generously sized and well proportioned to fit most people well.  The ties are formed by a single long strip that slides through the facings creating the neck loop.  The only small draw back is that even though it is quite long,  there is the potential for one end to come all the way out, requiring that you thread it through again.

If you are using more of watercolor paper, then this will still work, but you have to take some care when peeling it off.The only real issue I have with the Scotch is the thickness of the tape. it does tend to get caught on your straight edge.But since it tends toward the stickier side of the range you don't have to go wild with taping down the entire edge of the paper, you can just block the corners.This will hold the paper down.. so no movement in the middle of drawing or moving your tools.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3LWP7NAKDGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HVHXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3P3LWP7NAKDGE","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The spring hinges allow wide angle of expansion to fit any face or head.The placement of the bridge piece can create issues for some noses, and considering the weight, you could be pushing them back up your nose.( I have a bump where they should rest on my nose, so that is why I mention this..)But there are more than a few considerations.First.. they are heavy and large eyes.  Check with whoever does your lenses before you pass the point of not being able to return this frame.Depending on your prescription, you may or may not be able to get higher index lenses.. which you should have to eliminate the weight factor. Also make sure you have your Pupillary Distance perfectly correct.  The large lense size created alot of issues with my lab and the various lense coatings.  They had to be sent back several times.Higher index lenses will be less of an issue for the lab.They are worth trying on.

"First, this is the material that is missing from undergraduate stats textbooks: a critical analysis of the applications of statistics. While you do not need to know statistics to read this book, you should if you really want to walk away with new knowledge.The real point of this book is Silver contrasts Bayesian ideology with Frequentists approaches to forecasting. Bayes is not very well covered in undergrad stats texts. I remember the textbook I used in stats basically stuffed it in the conditional probability section as a few pages with little fanfare. And most books on Bayes seem targeted for the graduate level and don't offer a novice disscussion.The issues I have with this book are mostly directed at style of writing.  I found Silver's style hard to read at times. It read more like an academic paper translated afterward to be a mass market book for general readership.  Also the structure did not really work for me. Each concept goes from overview to specific to more specific to detailed.  well that is how it read to me personally, and it seemed redundant. Again this is my personal view on it, you may find the flow intuitive and easy to read.Overall a well researched book written by a brilliant person.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNLUNTRAYUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420411X#wasThisHelpful","R3UNLUNTRAYUE","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The other reviewer did a great job outlining the features of this item. So I am not going to repeat any of the information, though I do want to add a few things.  This item deserves more than one review.A few considerations for those buying this item. Not really cons, but some minor issues.First, the elastic strap is not adjustable, so this will not simply fit on a cover of any notebook as suggested in the product description. I use moleskine notebooks, the cardboard covered and this just bends the cover. So if might work on spiral notebooks that have strong covers, or it might work if you slip this over the entire notebook. This is not a con, and it is common sense.The upside is that the elastic band is snug.. everything about this is snug.  The pencil holders really hold your pens or pencils in this as you carry it around.The canvas material and the design do not allow for the compartments to hold very much.. the zipper pocket does have a nice size, but it does not have alot of depth. This is true of the outside pouches. If I were to make one change to this, it would be to allow for the zipper pouch to expand a little bit more.This is perfect for taking to class with just your book and the minimum of what you need. Or as a sketchbook caddie as it is designed.It is a well made clever item and the price makes it a great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYE98U4RLK95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QSTJYO#wasThisHelpful","R2UYE98U4RLK95","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The feel of the leather is nice and it gives it a professional look and feel. Usually pencil cases are designed for school kids or the crafting market so you really would not want to pull one out during a meeting. Or in the case of the craft/artist type they are typically too bulky to be convienent.So this pencil case fits the need for someone who wants to organize the pens and paperclips rolling around their briefcase or purse.

"I have several booklights and this one wins for the thought put into the design and the features.The issues I have with most book lights is that they might work well clipped to a book or they have an awkward size..This booklight will sit on a flat surface or you can clip it to a book. Okay so other booklights can do that.  But this also folds up to a perfect size to put into your pocket or leave clipped to a book.The arm and the light itself can be adjusted and will hold position.

"The four stars are because this is a great book on the Intel Parallel Studio and how to utilize the tools in your workflow.As a book to learn Parallel Programming; it is lacking. Considering the target audience is experienced programmers, I expected better coverage of both design and implementation considerations related to parallel programming. Everything is addressed from an application and algorithm level and completely ignores any coverage of system issues. ( IPC and Shared Memory are only covered at a superficial level ).So if you are going to use this as a tutorial on parallel programming alone, it is seriously lacking. You will not understand enough to know you have serious gaps in your learning. That is probably my biggest issue.As a book on the Intel Parallel Studio, this book is well worth the price.  This has some great labs and walks you through the tools and various parallel technologies provided with the Intel suite. The Intel documentation is hard to navigate and this book is a great jumping off point.  The author's provide code to test in the tools with bugs so you will understand the how and the why.This is the first printing, so there are alot of editing issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38DDN7KFX7DLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470891653#wasThisHelpful","R38DDN7KFX7DLB","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Montegrappa makes great pens.  This is not my first Montegrappa and they all perform flawlessly. The ink flow is perfect and the nib glides across the paper.This is a heavier pen and has great balance. Though the pen has a very wide barrel and the taper at the end is not comfortable for gripping. The image really does not impress a person that this is a wide pen. But it is.The colors are somewhat marbled and the light really makes it pop when you are writing with it as the various tones of blue move.For the price this is a steal.

"I really want to like this pen, and in some ways I do.First, nice color and size.  The magnetic cap is actually a great feature, and so is the ability to unscrew the nib from the body for cleaning. ( though this also seems to be the core of the ink flow issues as well ).The ergonomics really make fun to write with.  Though there are issues with inkflow, and don't slow down when the ink does flow or you will have wet spots. I don't consider this a fine nib. Though I generally prefer a pen which can produce crisp lines..  so it might be my own bias working against the pen.I use fountain pens for everything, and I would not use this as a daily writer. Though the nib is smooth even though it is a bit wet for my liking, but is an effortless pen.Here is where I put this pen.. I think there are better pens for the price.. Lamy studio is alot cheaper a 100% reliable, or the Lamy 2000 for around the same price is an outstanding pen.This is not a great starter pen, because the ink issues will turn you away from fountain pens. Also, if you were buying a business gift for someone you knew was into fountain pens, they would be unimpressed with this and you.  For your spouse or a friend, it would be a nice gift.This pen really turned me off of visconti.

"First, this bag is worth the price.. It is light,but can carry some weight.This bag is designed to be fashionable and functional.  The strap is comfortable and has a wide range of adjustment.  The design of the top of the bag has the staps mounted at an offset from the top of the bag.. this was a really smart feature since it allows the bag to form fit your body and distribute the weight more evenly. Also the straps adjustment buckle looks cool.  The strap padding and width of the strap really make it a comfortable bag.The material has that water resistant nylon type feel, and feels strong.The back magazine pocket is roomy, plus it does fight for space with the inside compartments of the bag.. So you can stuff the magazine pocket without making the flap impossible to close ( eventually there is a limit to this, but I put a textbook in it.A 15 inch laptop will fit, but this is really designed for the slim mac's and such.. my Dell 15inch xps was a snug fit.. ( but it actually made me feel like it was actually secure. ).The main compartment is roomy. There are several felt stacked pockets inside.. the felt is a brillant design. it acutally makes them all usable.. most laptop bags make these stacked pockets with firm nylon and they are impossbile to use for anything other than business cards..Okay here are a few issues I have with the bag.. first it is a very compact bag in height.. I wish it were another inch or so higher..The outside pockets are too small.  my laptop charger won't fit, and even my glasses case won't fit. And it is the height of the pockets that is the issue.. since they have magnetic closures there is very little tolerance for having secure pockets.The magnetic closure is also an issue for the main flap.. there is very little tolerance, and you really have to shuffle the load to ensure that it stays secured.Other than that it is a great bag..  though it is expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ULAJWVDY4UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H0J8CK#wasThisHelpful","R7ULAJWVDY4UO","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 2 lamy pens:  the 2000 extra fine and this one extra fine.I like them both, but for the price, the studio is a much better value.  First, it has a nice weight and balance. The construction of the pen is a smooth metal gripping surface and a brushed metal body.This pen has alot more weight than the 2000.  The major difference is the nib.. the studio is not a great quality nib, and ink flow can be inconsistent at times. Though it has improved as I use it more and break it in and I have gotten used to it.It comes with a piston converter so you can use either an inkwell or cartridge ink.The one irritation I have with the pen is the clip.. it is twisted to give it an artistic look, but it also makes it very thick.. so clipping the pen to a journal or notebook is not practical.For the price it is a great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FSZN2GQ12ALU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00115KY18#wasThisHelpful","R1FSZN2GQ12ALU","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For me it is an issue since it the balance is off due to the feather-like weight.  The other issue is the ""capping"" as the other reviewer defined.  If you don't cap the pen when in use, it is very small.. and when capping you really have to press it on for it to stay. and it almost seems like you are going to strip the threads doing it..

"This is probably the most recommended book by the historians I know in the 82nd Airborne Association. Marshall's unique position allowed him to write an authoritative account of the Paratroopers operations in Normandy.This reads like it was taken from his offical military records, so there is detail. The first part of the book is the 82nd, and the second part is the 101st.his drawings and maps are very specific to the local actions of specific units. And they are not great, since they are basically hand sketches. ( again probably taken from his orginal reports, though this is just a guess on my part ).  So you will get the detail, but you really need to have a basic understanding of the entire operation to really appreciate and follow his accounts.

"I had a slightly larger samsill backpack which I had to replace due to the width. My usage for backpacks is with my walker and the bicycle type basket, and for wheelchair when I am in the hospital. The width limitations of the basket make this perfect.The reason I mention the above is because I will not use the straps, which I have to wonder if will stay together if a person filled this backpack to full capacity. It does expand, and the support panel reinforces the bottom  well. But the weak point of this is where the straps are sewn into the backback. It is not an issue for me, but from other reviews it has been an issue for others.The material has a weather resistant quality. I don't think it will be water proof. I have been stuck in the rain with this when waiting for paratransit and this did a better job than my other samsill backpack of not absorbing water through the backpack.The front pocket has a zipper compartment which will easily hold a nook or the smaller kindle. (not sure about the older kindle which I know is wider ).My only other issue with this is the 15.6 laptop size. Yes it will fit, and the laptop protection will take care of everything except one weakspot at the top of the backpack.

"This series is great, but when these were written the resources available to Mathematica users was limited.Also, before I became disabled I was a software engineer since,, well more than 10 years. ( yeah I am really old now ).  So I understand what progammers and everyone has come to expected from a guidebook titled ""Programming"".  And this is not a ""hello world"" kind of book, nor is Mathematica really fit that paradigm.And of course the obvious point is that when these were written the documentation for Mathematica was not as evolved as it is today. Today we also have a nice selection of books available for Mathematica which cover it well. ( the Navigator is probably one of the best, and for programming The cookbook is actually good. and anything with Paul Wellin's name is a better fit for the programmer ).Now to this book. This is actually a great book and series if you want to understand everything about Mathematica. Trott explains every fine point about mathematics and using Mathematica for mathematics. It is not an easy read, as others have noted in their reviews because there seems to be alot of examples which are not concise nor do they illustrate concepts very well. Yet the book is full of them.  ( though Trott has taught me alot about various fields of mathematics. From modeling earthquakes to forest fires ).I have run into aspects of Mathematica, the finer points of patterns and manipulating very complex lists.  This book has illustrated not only how, but why you should choose one construct over another.  Trott does a great job of presenting the various programming elements of Mathematica, and stresses a process in which you simply do not translate from ""C"" to Mathematica. From page one he stresses that you should not focus simply on the result, but the entire process of deriving the result.So as a Mathematica user and programmer this is a great book, however, it is a better reference than it is a primary source of learning the basics. But as you advance with Mathematica this book is a great resource. Even the Mathematica documentation can be frustrating if you are not sure what question you need to ask if the first place, and the circular references and links don't help either.The CD as mentioned contains all of the books, so no need to buy all the books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCFF2HTJ9BN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0387942823#wasThisHelpful","R3DCFF2HTJ9BN0","ARKL8PLBDB4T5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARKL8PLBDB4T5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One problem was with my protective rubber boots. Trying to enlarge the hole to one inch was not a DIY job. I wasted money and destroyed the boots. It you have rubber boots that protect the lamp fixture from road dirt, take the boots to a machine shop. It is impossible to enlarge the socket access hole with any home tools.Other than that problem Kensun gets a 5 star rating. There are some suggestions for solving some common problems. Skim this for anything helpful.This concerns installation and adjusting the beams. Note that when adjusting your light, low beam shouldalways have a sharp cutoff: Bright light below and dark above. It they don’t,  you have an installation problem.Installation is straight forward except there is no mounting hardware to secure the ballasts to the car. I assume from the low cost charges by professionals that wire ties were used. I drilled and mounted the ballasts to the framework, using silicone and washers to prevent loosening. A secure wire tie mounting (tight to the car), is OK. You will need your own ties.Connecting the wires is bullet proof as the connectors don’t allow mistakes. The short part of the wiring harness will be closest to the battery with the long wires leading to the opposite side headlight. The harness is quality. Don't understand the negative comment.My big problem was enlarging my rubber boots as mentioned earlier. I still need to resolve the problem.The HID beams have a very sharp cutoff that makes beam adjustment easy. The cutoff is much sharper that my old Halogen lights. Although the lights are bright to on coming cars, they are not blinding. I do not get flashed by on coming cars.The included instructions are minimal. For beam adjustment, I recommend going to U tube. A good site there is ChrisFix – adjust headlight beams. There are others. It’s your choice.I encountered a “nut behind the wheel” problem. An easy call to tech support and they sent me a set of bulbs that helped discover the problem.I bought another HID set from eBay several years ago. The experience turned me off as I was cheated by the supplier so never installed them. I bought a complete set from Kensun, thus could compare the two systems.I am very happy with Kensun. They are superior to the cheaper set. If you review HID systems, Kensun comes out tops.I recommend the 5000K bulbs. The light approximates daylight where as 4300K is on the orange side and 6000K begins to have a blue/green tinge. I want to see in the dark. The 5000K gives the brightest light. Either side of 5000K begins to reduce the strength of the beam.WHICH IS BRIGHTEST? Someone tested all the Kensun varieties. The standard ballast, 35 watt 5000K system was significantly brighter than even the 55 watt system. That was a surprise. light meters can be subjected to different light frequencies but the 35 & 55 watt systems emit the same frequency.There are folks who are like some young kids. They confuse being different and being better. Just remember the two are not the same. Blue or Purkile lights may look cool but their light output sucks.Note about the headlight lens.Most cars have clear plastic headlight covers. These will cloud due to dust and dirt attacking the plastic. I restored them with 1500 grit wet/dry sand paper – used wet. (Do not use a more coarse paper. It will seriously increase your time with the polishing end.).Work the sandpaper in small circular patterns. Be careful, be CLEAN, do not allow foreign grit to get in your sanding. Just a single stroke will create significant damage. Continue sanding until close examination shows there are no scratches, fogging or pits on the plastic ( there are fine scratches from sanding). You may have a few really deep pits or scratches. Ignore them.If the damage is extensive you may need to buy replacements at $100 plus each. It’s your call.Follow your sanding with “White” polishing compound. It takes a lot of time depending on the destruction. Polish until all the fine sand paper scratches are removed. Wash with water adding a few drops of detergent. NOTE: If you try to stop short on the sanding, no amount of polishing will work. do each part properly.HID lights do not solve the problem of messed up plastic headlight covers. You can buy restoration kits but they are no better than my system and much more expensive. Some kits use a clear solution to fill in scratches after a thorough cleaning. They look good but the solution is softer than the original plastic and will not last like the original. Faster ain't always better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OO5ZQU9VO58K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050ZAFGO#wasThisHelpful","R3OO5ZQU9VO58K","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"KENSUN gets ``an A+ for customer service. I do not yet have enough experience but for this one comment.IMPORTANTMy Isuzu Rodeo has a rubber boot that protects the inside of the headlight from dirt. I destroyed it trying to enlarge to one inch for the Kensun HID bulb. Learn from my experience.by using the following procedure.Using a one inch hole punch, place the rubber boot on a wood board. Carefully center the punch around the boot hole. Firmly holding the punch, begin hammering the punch (I recommend a dead blow hammer or a rubber mallet).. A better solution would be to use a hole punch and a hydraulic press. Or best, pay a MACHINE SHOP to make the hole for you.Do not try to cut through in one whack or give two dozen ""love taps"" either. The rubber boot distorts when impacted. Examine your cut after each ""whack."" Replace the punch exactly where your cut is and repeat until you have the required one inch hole.Trying to drill the rubber causes the boot to be voilently ripped from your grasp, resulting in tearing the boot apart. A rotary file may work if you are willing to commit a month or so of your time.I do not know anything about the various types of boots, so if you have a solid boot like plastic, ignore this. You won't have my problem.The 4 stars is an attempt to balance their excellent service with their totally inadequate instructions.

"As a believer in Netzari theology, the author does not believe in 1 Thes 4:17, where the church is ""caught up"" by Y'shua in the clouds [this is a significant part of End Times prophesy]. The purpose in buying the AENT is to discover Biblical truth. Why buy a Bible that the translator does not believe it himself? [added 4/5/15]To begin, the AENT has some good points but some serious flaws. Sister Hannah has an analysis of the AENT with so much detail it is difficult for me to assimilate it. Her scholarly criticism of the AENT reminds me of, “I can’t see the forest for the trees.” Translation: There is so much detail that I can’t see the big picture.Since the big picture includes the End Times and is a major part of Protestant Theology, It is necessary that we pursue it. I do not fault her criticism, only that it does not adequately show us the real problem with the AENT.I admire Mr. Roth’s scholarship and his clarity but he allows his personal bias to cloud his analysis. For example in his objection to the Rapture he attacks the Catholic Church’s position on the Rapture rather than the Biblical foundation for it. That is a good debating strategy. But it only works if you fail to see its misdirection. The real basis for the Rapture is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:14-18 and it is quite clear.What we see in Thessalonians is the first reappearance of Jesus but notably He does not actually return. He stops short, in the clouds. The second coming occurs following the Tribulation. Roth’s philosophy denies the Rapture. This analysis seriously distorts the entire End Times events.More on this later.HERE IS MY TRY AT THE BIG PICTUREMr. Roth’s theology is founded on the Messianic Jewish philosophy called Netzari. They are Messianic Jews. They believe in the risen Messiah so they are similar to Christians. But there are significant differences. To me the most important are the Apostle Paul’s ministry and the Christian Rapture.For brevity this comment only touches on these two. Reference pages 933-938 in the ANET for Roth’s analysis of both the Rapture and the Apostle Paul. His revealed philosophy underlies the reasoning behind his footnotes.Will you agree that God is logical? He always has a purpose for everything and everything is motivated by love. Matthew 25, the Parable of the 10 Virgins is telling believers about the Rapture. But we must understand the ancient Jewish wedding if we are to see its meaning fully revealed. [There are a few websites that explain it fully. For brevity, I don’t do that here].Understand that in that wedding there is no sexual love or motivation. What motivates it is a call to duty. There is a deep respect for each other. It goes beyond our modern understanding of a wedding but we sure could use some of it today.To understand the big picture for the Rapture and Tribulation, we must know their purpose. The Trib is for the Jews who God has always loved.  Don’t believers usually come to Christ during a crisis?  Is not the Trib a big time crisis? God wants all His children with Him. But remember, He gives us free will. They are free to choose but must choose on their own.Its purpose is to bring His children Home so He can regain the fellowship lost in the Garden of Eden. The 144,000 must be His witnesses during the Trib. Didn’t God tell the prophet He always has a witness?Since both the Rapture and the Trib can’t be for the Jews, the Rapture must be for the Bride of Christ, the Church. The reason is found in the ancient Jewish wedding. God’s purpose for the Rapture is to keep the Church safe.The wedding ceremony is founded on the groom’s  promise to the Bride that she will always have security and safety. The parallel for the Rapture is in the 7 day sequestering when the now official union is consummated. Read about the wedding for a complete understanding.Sorry, I planned to include the AENT translation of Matthew 25:1-13 because it really adds clarity to its purpose. The differences are positive, minor but significant. That would make this too long. Hopefully this adequately describes the big picture that Roth’s footnotes hide.NOTE: I am a Christian. I believe the Bible is written by God to His children, the Jews. To really understand it requires that we understand Jewish history, tradition and culture. Did you know that God's calendar [Exodus12] states the year begins on Nisan one. That is our March 20 and its the first day of Spring.Isn't it just like God to begin our year at the true beginning of the year when nature springs to life, rather than in the dead of winter? That's our God!","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RFIFYX8R9HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934916420#wasThisHelpful","R28RFIFYX8R9HR","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The authors are clear and to the point. IF you accept their Baptist theology, you will like it.My problem is they fail to understand that God wrote His instructions to His children, the Jews. To understand the Bible requires an intimate relationship with the Jews, their history and culture. The authors fail miserably. Thus in many places, particularly in Jesus' parables their analysis is less than worthless because it not only misses the mark but seriously miss directs the reader. The problem may stem from [once saved, always saved.] Wrongly interpreted, it is a tool of satan.If you can find a copy of this commentary, check out how totally wrong their analysis of the ten virgins is. Much of the commentary is OK. But when an author's foundation is flawed, I have difficulty trusting anything they wrote. There are other good commentaries. Check out the analysis of the ten virgins before buying one.This example details my difficulty with their commentary.  Let me use Matthew 25, Jesus' parable of the ten virgins. To understand this, requires that the reader sees the comparison to the ancient Jewish wedding [an Internet search reveals one or two sites that nail it. I like the church - based in WV] The comparison is between the wedding and Jesus' meeting His bride [the church] in the sky. His purpose is to honor His commitment to protect His bride from harm [the Tribulation].I will leave the discovery to you, the reader, when you research the ancient Jewish wedding. It is beautiful once you have an understanding of Jewish culture. I would like to hear from anyone who does this. I  was blown away and had to totally revise my understanding of many precious Christian beliefs.As to 'once saved, always saved' -- Personally I believe our salvation is secure as long as we hunger for a personal relationship with God. Example -- Do you read a few verses in His book everyday, trying to really understand Him? Don't read a couple of chapters in a ""through the Bible in  a year plan.."" All God asks is for our heart to be right. It's easy, simple and straightforward. He is a loving God, not mean or cruel.We just can't be self centered and insist on doing things our own way. When we said our salvation prayer, did we leave out the ""repent"" part? If we did not promise to turn away from our old life AND DO IT, we cannot say we follow Jesus and make Him Lord.Continue to do right and we are secure in 'once saved, always saved' foundation. It is no accident that the parable of the Talents immediately follows the ten virgins. We have responsibilities and we receive the consequences -- good and bad.If you do not accept that God wrote the Bible to the Jews, I feel sorry for you. Maybe you believe in Replacement theology [that Christians have replaced the Jews in God's plan.] All negatives on this comment will come from that group.

"I gave this to a teenage friend after skimming over it. It uses the NKJV translation solving a readability problem inherent with the King James that uses antiquated words and sentence structure. Please don't misunderstand. I like the KJV. It was my first Bible and is one of my Bibles I use. It is definitely NOT a Bible for new Christians or teenagers.A Bible is only effective when read. Why intimidate new Christians with a difficult book that is even difficult when written in plain English? The NKJV is not as easy to follow as the ""thought 4 thought"" translations like the NLT. But it is friendlier to the Holy Spirit. It works for me and is the Bible that goes to church with me.My friend found the NKJV readable so hope she learns to read it for understanding. The study part is designed to appeal to teenagers and is a helpful guide in receiving what God is telling us.Every new Christian should be given a study Bible, not just  any old Bible. It is a complex book with many hidden messages. Would you give a mathematics book written in Hebrew, to a student and expect them to get a passing grade?I found the publisher (Thomas Nelson) is on friendlier terms with the Holy Spirit than most mainstream  publishing houses. I believe in the Trinity and Jesus' promise that we receive the Holy Spirit as comforter and a source for God's power. It is with this power that Jesus won the lost. He promised that we could do the same. This is how God's desire to win the lost to Christ is best achieved.Although not as popular as the ""Life Application"" study Bible by Tyndale House, which is not Holy Spirit friendly, The Extreme Teen is a solid Bible. I recommend it, particularly for teens. It may be the best out there but I have only a few ""studies"" for comparison.

"The Bible is written, by God  to the Jewish people, using their culture, customs, calendar and feast days. If a Christian fails to understand this, they lose the ability to receive much of its message. It is complex, with messages inside messages.One important understanding is learning about the relationship of Christ (the Bridegroom) with the Christian Church (the Bride of Christ). It follows a direct pattern mirrored in the ancient Jewish wedding. It is not only the ceremony but involves the entire procedure from the selection of the bride by the father, building the new home by the son, the feast, the ceremony and the 7 day consummation of  the union. This can enlighten you about the Rapture and the Tribulation.Look it up on the Internet; it is not explicitly explained Biblically but Mesianic Rabbis' understand it. Although not a Jew, I've discovered that Messianic Rabbis, like Cahn are better equipped to pass on Biblical wisdom, partly because their knowledge Marries the O.T.  with the N.T.It has been said that people who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Please tell me how Biblical history and current history differ? If you  believe God is the author of the Bible, this makes sense to you. Believing, gives you an immoveable anchor on which to rest your faith. Without that you have a constantly moving anchor at best. Every sailor knows how to ""set"" an anchor. Is a moveable anchor what you would use to anchor YOUR boat?Another analogy is a child's relationship with a loving parent. A child, when either hurt or afraid, knows he can run to her parent for comfort, protection and support. Do I serve a loving God, who even more than a loving parent, is my Father in heaven? Or is he a distant god who asks and rewards in ways a loving parent finds abhorrent? Having the security of knowing your loving God is why the Bible is so important in a Christian's walk. It is that relationship in which the Harbinger was written.All that said, there are several other prophesies coming together that offer validity to Cahn's book.On the Harbinger's readability, it is an interesting read that intertwines fact with fiction. Cahn takes several events that followed 911, compares those to ancient Biblical history and shows a pattern between them and events unfolding in America today.  Whether one believes the message does not detract from it making a good story. Novels must be based on a believable story that flows easily from beginning to end. The Harbinger does that. By the way, a harbinger is a warning of things to come, so it is an appropriate title.Read the book, you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TKG8RQ2XVXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161638610X#wasThisHelpful","R18TKG8RQ2XVXR","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From several reviews I expected a chair that only fits light-weight, small frame folks. Never to see 70 again, I am an average 5' 8"" and an overweight 175lb guy that can slide into a 40/42 suit.The #17 indicates that the inside span between the arms is17"" (and it is a true 17""). The cloth is strong canvas. There are individual, locking brakes on the rear wheels, accessible by the caregiver's foot but not the user. All 4 wheels are 8."" The two front wheels rotate; the rear are fixed. The wheels are a composition plastic with hubs that have well designed, metal bearings. I see no shortcuts in the quality of the transporter.Update: Forgot one thing. There are rubber foot pads on the frame, next to the rear wheels. By putting your foot on one, it gives added leverage when tipping the chair back to negotiate obstacles; a nice touch that overcomes the smaller wheel size.I sit comfortably, with more than ample room. A 19 would be excessively large and uncomfortable for me. Personally, I don't care for foot rests but a taller person would want to use the footrests. For me, they always seem to be in the way and hinder me when trying to motivate under my own power. I walk short distances with a cane and my wife pushes me on longer ones - when I just stick out my legs. Even at Costco or the mall, I make do without rests. Thank goodness tho, they all have floors whenever we pause. Nice, needed exercise!Several other transporters weigh 15lb, so the extra 4 lb (this is 19lb, less w/o the foot rests) increases its strength - a good thing. If you can pick up 15lb, you surely can handle 19lb. Like all transporters, it picks up with one hand by cloth handles sewn into the seat  (here, one on each side), making it a breeze to jerk up and toss into your back seat or trunk. Unless you drive one of those super-tiny gas sippers, you don't even need to collapse the handles and footrests but they will accommodate.It lacks some unnecessary bells and whistles, available for a couple 'a Benjamin's more. When you get this, you pay a couple 'a saw bucks extra for a stronger frame. For my money buy this as a #17 unless you are 200lb plus and need a 44/46 suit. If  you have a 17"" chair at home (measure it between the handles or arms), that will tell you how you fit.If I designed a transporter, it would be like this. All wheels are 8"". Larger 12"" wheels (offered on the more expensive transporters), make traveling on rough outdoor terrain (like a family picnic) or possibly manhandling someone backwards up brief stairways a bit easier. For normal interior buildings with moderate floor level changes this is super. Any problems are usually solved by pulling the transporter backwards. With the #17, a stronger caregiver can tip and lift the patient to negotiate minor obstacles easily (but done easier with a standard chair).If your caregiver is strong, they can tip a standard wheelchair back, balancing it on the large rear wheels to navigate difficult obstacles. I don't feel this is as practical with the 8"" wheels, but works for transitions of 2/3"" high. I hope this gives you an idea of its capabilities and limitations.Although I got mine from a friend, Amazon has great prices. From my experience on my many other purchases, they stand behind what they sell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNPKEV2MDWTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A6HMAA#wasThisHelpful","R2BNPKEV2MDWTU","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure what you get that makes this worth a couple of Benjemins when our stripped Glory was a single Grant but here is the info we can offer. I’m no cell expert but have some info on the service providers that may be helpful.First a note about the Huawei Glory. I use Amazon extensively but like the easy return options at Wally’s (a last resort, love hate relationship). They have it at half price, making it a super value.Good customer support and a good phoneBiggest problem is the on-screen keyboard. Even laid “landscape” my small size 8 fingers hit wrong keys about 1 of 4 entries. A stylus is a must for me. A 32GB SD is less than ten bucks from our Asian friends, making the total package unbeatable unless you are a hi-dollar, gadget freak.. This is my 6th cell and am happy with the technology strides over the years.Our experience with service providers: Although Tracfone is new to us, I am impressed, with their support, the phone and with their flexible system of refill cards. Not a major cell phone user, we wanted a cost effective, flexible “no contract” phone. In our opinion Tracfone is the best available and here is why.We have used US Cellular, T-Mobile and Tracone as no contract and Verizon, AT&T and Sprint as contract. But this only concerns our experience with the three no-contract folks.First US Celular: as their dealer they cost me almost $200 and it was a bitter learning experience in dealing with a company that does not give a toot about people. I cannot recommend them in any way.T-Mobile has poor reception in our area of N.C. but our main problems are their incredibly poor customer support and refill plan. When they changed their refill system it wound up costing us almost $300 in lost minutes. There was no sympathy and no recourse. We cannot recommend thenTracfone has a plan that eliminates all of the problems we had with T-Mobile. Their support folks have been great. The contract companies are easy to deal with but we are retired and cannot afford their high monthly cost.Last is Magic Jack. Although not a cell phone provider, their broadband Internet phone service is an objectionable, alternative for some folks. Their auto renewal system gives dishonest information and should be reported to the government Do we recommend them or is there a better alternstive? The answer is NO and YES. We used MJ for three years before learning of VoIP. If you have hi speed Internet, VoIP is a cost effective way to get good low-cost phone service.We found that the lowest cost system is to buy an OBI HAI VoIP interface device (Amazon has great prices). Get the cheapest one for simple home use. Obihai has several service providers that discount to ObiHai owners. Their service is cheaper and better than MJ. Also our provider, PhonePower, has very nice, Calif based support. NOTE We recommend at least a 5mip Internet broadband.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILXGRSZ15XKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FE2UGNU#wasThisHelpful","R2ILXGRSZ15XKF","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must begin with an explanation of the two different schools of thought mirrored in EVERY study Bible. This is critical to choosing a study Bible that agrees with YOUR personal theology. This is almost never explained to prospective readers.Study Bibles fall into two basic categories: liberal and conservative. The liberal school believes the Bible was “God’s word” as written and understood by men. Thus it is open to interpretation.Conservatives believe God is the author and it was penned by “scribes.” As a conservative, I can’t believe an all powerful God, creator of the universe would not write His OWN book to His children – you and me.Does it makes sense that a God for who we lay down our very life in His service, that He would trust men to NEVER make a mistake in interpreting His intent? Believe that and you have to buy one of my tickets on the next Mars shuttle. Only one left. How about it?That said “The Word in Life Study Bible” is conservative and it is one of the best choices of the conservative study Bibles. I won’t go into its details; they are covered elsewhere.There is one important point not covered and that is, “What are really the main differences in the two schools?They are important.” It is important if you want the fullness of God as promised by Jesus in John 14. Jesus promised we would receive the comforter (the Holy Spirit). Jesus received the Holy Spirit, described in John 1:28-34. It follows that Jesus performed His miracles with the power of the Holy Spirit and that is mirrored in John 14 when we are promised the power to do Jesus’ works. Liberals deny this interpretation.Don't misunderstand; Jesus is God and all powerful but here He was man and capable of dying for us. In heaven, we don't die, do we? Does it make sense that God's laws apply differently here and in heaven? Jesus received the Holy Spirit for a reason; otherwise why does the Bible make a point of it? God is logical. He has a reason for everything. God structured our whole world on order and logiic - right down to how atoms function and are the building blocks for everything - everything..Further, in the interpretation of Genesis 1:26-27, liberals deny, exclude or offer alternate versions of the implied Trinity. This is key to watering down the importance of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit’s role in a Christian’s life is removed, it destroys our power. And that was Jesus’ key to winning the lost.In Africa today, many thousands are coming to Jesus by way of Reinhard Bonnke. He is a man of God who uses the promised power of the Holy Spirit to win the lost, just as Jesus promised. So don’t tell me I’m wrong.The Bible is a complex book with many messages about life and God. Think about what is important to your Christian life and how you want to grow closer to Him. Then decide what is a good choice for your personal study Bible,A study Bible helps understand difficult or hidden meanings. It should not be a substitute for your own understanding. Go with God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RYKXUJN920TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0840719469#wasThisHelpful","R3RYKXUJN920TL","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I like their approach.Head first books offer a unique approach  your traditional “text book” style. Type A people may not like it as they relate more to the quick and brutal approach to learning.Because its style is unique let me try to explain it. Picture yourself in a small class where your teacher presents ideas together with practice sessions, then follows each new concept with a Q&A period. This is the best word picture I can think of. At the end of chapters there is a review. “Did you get it?”On each page the book uses pictures with short groups of traditional text together with “cartoon” like text.. It is a very open presentation.If you are learning disabled, their open format is well suited to your way of learning. As a teacher, I discovered that learning is easiest when a teacher can build on a student’s existing knowledge. HTML AND CSS have little for most people to build on. This book does the best job of bridging that I have seen.As a beginners book, it is first class. On completion, you will be ready to tackle advanced concepts.

He has written (or rewritten) 30 - yes thirty - books with the same basic title, using the same basic text. He sells these on the  Internet, making money. This is not something a true Christian would do.Each ""book"" attacks a person who wrote about supernatural experiences but King's basic attack uses distorted theology. To use a Swiss expression, by calling himself Christian and a pastor, ""He decorates himself with foreign feathers.""His books try to turn opinion into fact. The Bible documents examples of every supernatural events including visits to heaven. Why not go to the source for information?

"UPDATE (Feb 2013) Do NOT let the bulb dry out. There is a piece of gauze resting against the bulb that needs to be kept wet. Let it dry our and you will be buying a replacement bulb.(Original comment) Have had the HM-200 for several years and it does a good job (repeatable readings, ease of use). I give it a 5 because of quality and customer support. Based on quality/price, the PH-200 is about the cheapest available, including units on ebay.Suddenly my HP-200 stopped working yesterday (readings going wildly wrong mostly reading a 10.0 no matter the water tested). I called the company HM DIGITAL to find out why I could not calibrate it. The answer was that the sensor should be replaced every two years or so. He said there is a gel that gradually drys out. This is a wakeup because all ph meters use similar technology. Why this is important is that some ph meters do not have replaceable sensors. You can buy cheap meters but you take your chances on accuracy, mickey mouse calibration etc.If you are considering this or have one, I found a supplier that sells a replacement sensor at a reasonable price. the supplier is allwatercare com. in Atlanta. They also sell many different water testers and discount. I paid $38 for my replacement sensor while all other suppliers I checked wanted around $75 to $80. The company also has buffer solutions, cheap batteries etc. I think other companies just want to sell new units. Hope this helps.NOTE: My wife said she had dropped the meter a while ago but there was no apparent damaged. The sensor is a glass bulb and although the unit continued to work but it may have damaged a seal allowing a leak, accelerating the gel loss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2547BKB55BYFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00132G102#wasThisHelpful","R2547BKB55BYFB","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 4/17Discovered it is necessary to close the slide with the full force of the spring. (So my initial comment on the slide is wrong.) This locates the laser beam correctly and is repeatable. What is not known yet is the accuracy of the beam. The beam is CLOSE to true but there appears to be a slight change in beam position when the bore sighter is rotated in the chamber. Without a access to a good calibration setup, this is the best I can do for now.  SUMMARY: The sighter is in close agreement with the gun sights. This is a positive report and am impressed with its performance so far. My position on the two devices covered in the first comment has not changed.This bore sighter has none of the chamber insertion problems I hear about with other cheap pistol bore sighters.1) The sighter fits easily in the chamber and is identical to a 9mm round. It is well made and brass.2) It has no adjustment screws. But without a precision calibration setup, I can only say it seems to be fairly accurate.3) Battery life is short, as expected but the supplied alkaline's hold up for at least 2-3 minutes. That is more than enough time to install the batteries, chamber the sighter and check out how it compares to the pistol sights. I used the same batteries four times before they began to wink out.4) There is NO caution of ""don't close the slide."" Which is an idiotic requirement, as a pistol's barrel does not lock into firing position until the slide closes. So this passes this test with flying colors.5) The kit includes 4 batteries; two are needed for one operation. So you can get two battery loads without resorting to buying more. I still have the second set. The laser lights as soon as you begin to screw the two parts of the sighter together so be quick. Closing the slide slowly or letting it snap on spring action made no difference in the beam position so I close it firmly by letting the slide snap the last inch or so of travel while pointing the gun down to hold the sighter in the chamber.6) Shipping was very fast (from AZ). This is a very good vendor. There are several vendors offering the same sighter. He is cheapest and the service is first class.7) It is well made and has excellent value for the small investment.That covers the pro.The con is that the bore sighter indicates that my Taurus 24/7 9mm 4"" barrel, shoots about 3"" high at 15 yards. This conflicts with my pistol bench testing, which shows that my pistol sights are accurate to less than a half inch at 15 yards.This means the bore sighter has a problem. I cannot explain that at this writing. Once able to do exact testing, I will update this comment. The rating will either increase or decrease depending on the results.To be clear, the bore sighter seems to be accurate in my jury rigged calibration setup yet in testing with my pistol it is considerably off. I cannot explain this so I will not give this a bad evaluation.I do have another comment that has to do with a pistol laser beam, NOT with this bore sighter. I favor the pistol laser beam as explained here.Being retired, the strength in my arms and hands ain't what it used to be. Since I've not used a pistol for decades, I needed to get up to speed if this is to serve its purpose (home and carry defense).I purchased hand and arm weight and exercisers, knowing that accurate shooting requires more than average strength. This is an oft overlooked problem.I knew I needed solid feedback to tell me what was needed to improve my accuracy. The pistol laser provides that perfectly and it has proven to be a much better investment on my way to becoming an accurate shooter. My optimistic goal is to have a 2"" group at 10 yards.I use the laser beam when dry firing (no bullets). Dry firing exercises train my muscles to overcome our normal tendencies. These are the root cause for inaccurate shooting. I probably dry fire 3 to 5 hundred times for every live round fired. The laser beam on the target exaggerates the very small movements in my pistol, showing where and how to improve. I can't see this without the laser beam. It is particularly useful when dry firing (for obvious reasons) and is why I dry fire so often. Hey, dry firing is FREE.No need to bore you with how to be a better shooter; Youtube is an excellent resource. The many Youtube videos are like hiring your personal NRA expert that is on your beck and call 24/7. They cover stance, trigger, hand hold - all aspects of pistol control. I like Hickok but many have great points too.After two months, I'm slowly gaining accuracy. The biggest problem has been developing sufficient strength to hold the pistol steady and to be able to control my trigger pull without even a slight waver. Watching the experts on youtube, there is a long road ahead for this old codger. Patience and persistence.SUMMARYFor my circumstance, a cheap pistol laser has been a better investment than a bore sighter. The reasoning is that modern hand guns are delivered, shooting with excellent accuracy. Manufacturing tolerances give computer accuracy and factory testing on every weapon. This precludes having any ""turkeys"" in the market place.That said, any problems that surface on the range will be with the ""whatever"" that is firing the pistol. The solution is to find the exact problem and fix it quickly. This is where the pistol laser and expert training comes into play. Once the basic steps are known so old habits are erased, it is a matter of watching the laser on the target to identify any small problems remaining.Good luck, have fun. For me, developing accuracy requires diligence but is fun with the right training aids. NOTE: I like my Taurus 9mm but it is about 10 oz heavier than a comparable  Glock 19. In my novice opinion, the extra weight adds some stability but requires more muscle control for accuracy (my take after firing both for an afternoon.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R391M7JGT8QUF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HW9QB8#wasThisHelpful","R391M7JGT8QUF0","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most reviewers miss the purpose Mel Gibson had in making this film. This will explain it from a Christian perspective. The crucifixion of Christ is central to all believing Christians. It is their beginning, their end and their rock. Love or hate them, if you expect to understand them read this without developing opinions until the end.Bear with me as I have to lay some groundwork for you to understand my comment. I don't ask you to believe the Bible, only to understand the purpose of the film.The movie is meant for Christians. It is meant to show what Christ did for them and for everyone (whether they understand or not). The Bible was written over a period of 1400 years by 44 different people. It is complicated because it has a number of different messages or themes, of which I will not attempt to cover.For the purpose of this comment, what is central to the Bible are four basic threads. 1) It is a book of prophesy, mostly prophesy about the coming Christ (there are over 100 of these, all of which were fulfilled by Christ). 2) There is the story of his 3 year evangelism, in which He proved by miracles that He was the Christ (prophesied 100's of years earlier). 3) It describes Christ's sacrifice, death and resurrection (proving that Christ has power over death). 4) It describes what a Christian is to exhibit in their life (How they are to live).You may believe the Bible is a total fake, I am not defending it. But that does not change what I state above. Those four threads exist in the Bible. That is fact. I need to say that in order to explain the reason for the film.The Bible states that God sent Christ, His Son, to be a sacrifice for all. Before Christ, Jews had to sacrifice animals to absolve them of sins but animals were not perfect sacrifices. Christ had to be a PERFECT sacrifice. He was (Proven by Jewish history and their losing their homeland). Also to fulfill the prophesy given 700 years before His arrival (see Isaiah chapter 53), that He had to suffer the terrible punishment you see in Gibson's film.Let me pause. Non-Christians will find it implausible, inexcusable and abhorrent that any god would be part of the acts seen in the film or in my statements. To make it even more confusing, God is a loving God. He wants only good for everyone. Talk about something inexplainable!It is a waste of time for me to try and explain or defend this. You can discard the Bible as fiction but it is what is written on its pages. In that, there can be no dispute.The Bible is unique in history. There is no book that is a compilation of different authors where they all agree and present a cohesive message, let alone doing it over a period of more than a thousand years.So what was the purpose behind such a violent, unpleasant film?Christians understand that Christ was a sacrifice for their sin, allowing them to enter the Kingdom of God. But before seeing the film, I did not really comprehend it on a visceral level. If I am an example, the film is a success; ""It was important that I experience His sacrifice"". If you feel that you, your church or group will benefit from a better understanding of Christ's sacrifice, get the film. It has no equal in its scope or purpose.That was the purpose of ""The Passion of Christ."" It shows the price that God and Christ really paid so that Christians could enter the kingdom.I can hear someone saying, ""Whoop Eee Doo."" See! That proves my point that most reviewers do not understand the film. Some will feel my comment is crazy, stupid or worse. That does not change the truth presented here. Remember that I only present what the Bible states, not asking you to believe it.If you question me and want to investigate on your own, go to the Internet. There is a free Biblical resource that will help you look into it. In your search engine, type ""eSword"" to find the site. I've always believed that the truth is revealed when you understand all sides of an issue.If you want to look into the existence of Christ, investigate the ""Shroud of Turin"" on the Internet. It is believed by many that this is the shroud that covered Christ when His body was laid in the tomb. It is a controversial but a fascinating story.If you want to look into whether history and archeology back up the Bible, look up ""Ron Wyatt"" on the Internet. He was an amateur student of Biblical history and discovered some interesting facts. As with all things relating to the Bible, everything has its naysayers so you can come to your own conclusions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PIGJLRAMZ3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00028HBKC#wasThisHelpful","R23PIGJLRAMZ3Y","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Chinese made legally licensed Meyerco product. Meyerco makes a quality line of knives and also sells their US made line (for a lot more $$$). This 3 inch (closed) knife generally shows good workmanship and has a quality 440C stainless steel blade (holds an edge and sharpens easily). For the price it is a really good buy. That is the plus side.The Negative is in how it opens. It is an A/O or assisted open. It does that but not well. First, a 4 inch knife is easier to open one handed than a 3 inch (this one). That means the assist really has to work well. I took it apart to determine the problem and see if it could be improved. The answer is yes (to some extent) but I do not recommend it unless you have some skill in knife design.The design of the spring is unique, giving the blade opening force a ""double kick."" It should open fully after the initial push from the thumb. Instead it hangs at about 130 degrees (0 degrees being closed and 180 degrees full open). This forces you to push the blade full open. Doing than brings your thumb into contact with the very sharp blade (uh huh). Maybe a better solution is to use arm and wrist action so centrifugal force gives additional momentum to the blade. I don't like that because everyone within 50 feet will know you opened your ""quick open"" knife - It's like shouting hey I got this deadly knife and I'm a bad a**."" Now this takes a little practice as you can easily lose your grip and the knife goes flying. Hopefully you don't have to retrieve it from that blond's dress with the plunging neckline. Anyway, you get the idea.Note: At this writing, the picture does not show the serrated blade, which is about 75% serrated with a straight blade section at the tip and again at the heel.Summary: It is a really nice little knife with a design problem. I do not believe Blackie Collins designed his knife to have this problem, so I blame the Chinese execution of his design. I hope the heat treating of the blade was better as that is more important than the quality of the blade steel (Properly heat treated, 440C should have a hardness in the range of 58RC). Sorry, I can't test that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21M0GCH8ADABR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012QSRG0#wasThisHelpful","R21M0GCH8ADABR","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Atlas Shrugged"" was written to voice a possible future political climate as Ayn Rand foresaw it. It is similar to George Orwell's ""1984"" in that their main theme includes a controlling  government. But Atlas Shrugged's purpose, government and its scope are very different. The tongue-in-cheek humor and allusion in 1984 is missing from Atlas Shrugged.  1984 was written in 1948; Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Both are well written. Both, in order to make their story work, weave in a little science fiction.Atlas Shrugged is also available in audio book form, for those intimidated by its 1000 pages.Atlas Shrugged is far more complex -- and long than 1984. The government's purpose in both is similar but Atlas Shrugged begins with a normal country similar to that of 1950 America (sans the influence and control of the Constitution). Powerful politicians, business leaders and scientists are the policy makers. These ""behind the scene insiders"" sell their form of ""government"" to a gullible, ignorant and self serving public, using two tried and true political ploys: (1) to each according to their ability and to each according to their need (translation: class warfare); (2) for the good of the people.The protagonists are also powerful business leaders except they oppose the idea of government control over the individual. They fight for individual freedom for all as outlined in the original Constitution.A note to younger readers: Rand's style uses lengthy character development and conversational interaction. Although a real ""page turner,"" it is not the fast paced modern style of writing. It is important to the story (especially to her conservative views) but at times seems a bit wordyAs a novel, it is a great read and I do not want to spoil it. I only give you the essence of the book so you can decide if it is a book for you. I leave the details for your exploration and discovery. To accept an abbreviated summation of Atlas Shrugged is like looking at a picture of the Grand Canyon and believing that you done ""been 'dere, done 'dat.""Atlas Shrugged's real purpose unveils the weaknesses and consequences of liberal thinking. It is an accelerated picture of the politics from the 1930's, through to a fairly accurate mirror of what Ms Rand foresaw would exist in today's politics - and beyond. Happily, it does not have a sad end.In a sentence, Atlas Shrugged is an epic novel of romance, mystery, conspiracy and intrigue. It is well written and gripping despite its technical and political weaknesses, which are easily overlooked. (Remember, it was written in the 1950's.) It is heavily influenced by its conservative author. This is so evident that a person steeped in liberal philosophy will find it most objectionable. Conservatives, independents and libertarians will find it thought provoking, controversial and enjoyable.In keeping with the liberal agenda of today's universities, 1984 was on my required reading list. Most people have heard of, if not read 1984 but few have heard of Atlas Shrugged.I mention the following to exemplify the political climate in the media and publishing world. There are two ""top 100 lists"" of America's greatest novels, both published in the late 1990's. Atlas Shrugged heads one list but deserves no mention in the other. One list was authored by the editorial board of Modern Library (associated with the publisher Random House) consisting of 11 authors (who graciously included a number of their own novels). The second is a poll of 200,000 selected readers. I leave it to your wisdom to select the one listing Atlas Shrugged #1.Ayn Rand was an influential conservative, ahead of her time. Today, there is a conservative ""Think Tank"" named after her.

"A rewrite 3/6/2011 to address some comments by Liberals.Please refer to these abbreviations.BK=Beck; MB=Milbank; page=#;  paragraph=P.  Tea Party=TPMLB uses BK's occasional comments (IE  humor, sarcasm, honest error)  to sidestep BK's numerous opposing positions. That is a common tool of ""smear journalists."" Label these as ""smobs"" short for smear bombs.Some of MB's comments ""make mountains from molehills."" Example: trashing BK's historical facts by using faulty dates (the fact is the issue, not the time). Call these ""doop"" short for dogpoop.Other ploys use isolated examples or slips to label BK, yet ignore the side supporting same. Call these ""Birp"" for a Bircher/Pravda Clone (Pravda was the official Communist newspaper, the John Birch Society was a radical conservative organization). They both used lies and distortions to manipulate opinion.Not a rabid BK supporter, I only comment on TV, not listening to BK radio or reading BK books. I do not always agree with Beck but rail against falsehoods, thus my objection to the book.#2 P1= mostly ""Smobs."";  Mortal enemies? That's a Birp#2-3 P4= last election shows Tea Party influence with nation-wide support, proving MB's paint brush of the TP is ""Birp."".#3 P3=BK does not specifically call Obama a Marxist =Smob.#3 P4=BK did make jokes about Weiner but not ""penis jokes."" Again a Smob. Also, Weiner was first to attack. More Birp.#7 P3=Complete distortion: Israel did not attack the flotilla; it was a rescue of Israeli monitors being attacked by on board people. Watch the Israel video for proof. A big time Birp.#9 P3=BK's advertisers have been under constant attack from a number of Liberal sources so MB's comment is a distortion =Birp, Birp, Birp.#10 P2=Neither BK nor TP leaders say He is any kind of TP leader. Another Smob.#10 P4=BK always says to check out the facts, usually giving sources. Birp.#11 P1&4=The idea of a World government is decades old, even Bush#1 promoted it once or twice. But BK strongly opposes it. Hello, another big time Birp#14 P2=BK strongly opposes any kind of violence and is not surprised supporters are not violent. Part Birp, part Smob.#15 P4=Supporters are not frightened; instead He promotes examination and preparation. A Smob.#17-19=The story of BK's tears; presented as fact, Undocumented stories have no place here so  this is a Birp.#20=MB makes fun of Beck's tears, about Palin's and BK's ""special needs kids."" As a father of one, I find this section reprehensible. No one understands that pain. I will not comment on the rest of Ch1. It shows me an ugly side of the author and disgusting.Ch2=BK's early history. Can't comment as not being a strong BK fan, I don't read his books.Ch3= Ties BK to Church of LDS, which is a turnoff for middle America. I'm not Mormon but this attempt by MB is identical to racism. Being opposed to both religious and racial discrimination, much of this chapter is not worth comment. BirpCh3 Second part=Concerns the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. MB follows the vein of early attacks on our Constitution by attacking the Christianity of our Fathers, then, tying this to early Mormon writers. In short, MB is not credible. To shed light on our history, I point to a frequent guest of BK's - David Barton and his ""Wall Builders"" It's a well documented history of our Founding Fathers and the Constitution with little known facts - interesting.Ch4=Milbank is wrong. BK does not believe ""The end is near"" but he documents a vast array of facts to show that our country is under attack. MB ridicules this extensively.Making fun of serious matters is effective with anyone not appraised of the truth. Again, I suggest you research it.  No surprise that this is Birp.Milbank ridicules ""end time prophesy."" As a Christian I'm more familiar than most on it but have no dog in the fight. It is interesting how so many peoples, both ancient and current, converge on the concept. But to ridicule it while lacking real understanding of the philosophies is unworthy of comment. Can't decide if this is Birp or Smob.Ch5= MB is back on BK's ""fear trip,"" discounted earlier. On #85 MB discusses the show with Massa ( saw it). This too is distorted. Beck allowed Massa a platform not offered by other media..The interview was a waste, which BK acknowledged. Total Smob.#89= MB discusses a Jon Stewart show. Both Stewart and Beck weave comedy into current events and both are smart, What's the point? Another Smob.Ch8=MB says BK glues Obama to Hitler. But this is a smoke screen. The real divide between MB and BK is the concept of whether Big Government leads to a better America. That is a legitimate debate but MB distorts the real issue with a continuation of ""Smob and Birp.""It appears the author does not have the knowledge or maybe the intelligence to tackle the real issue and so resorts to ""S and D."" But for intelligent readers; research it.I hate to skip Ch9, Woodrow Wilson, ""the light and love of Liberals and father of the IRS."" You didn't know he enabled the IRS with the ""Income Tax"" 16th Constitutional Amendment? Well that is only part of his ""legacy against America."" Research the real W. Wilson to understand BK's politics.Ch11=A flash of MB brilliance. Having seen some of the shows the book uses as examples, I can  say MB has done a marvelous job of distorting facts. He uses sarcasm, innuendo and falsehood to paint BK as an over-the-top, nut. What MB does not disclose is that BK documents everything he says with either video, audio or quotations to make this points. A prime example of BirpCh11 reveals MB's politics by the people chosen.. All are left of center; none are mainstream. MB supports them; BK opposes them.Summary: If the book's purpose is to inflame Liberals by trashing BK it's a success. For me ""Barf""","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFGTFO7MZSKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385533888#wasThisHelpful","R2FFGTFO7MZSKZ","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"INTROSorry for the length but the XXL550M is a complex device with many features and options. If you know a lot about GPS's, just read the PROS, CONS & SUMMARY. If you want details, this is organized by headings so you can easily skip to what interests you. Because of the misinformation, this turned into a review instead of a comment.Many of the other comments are misleading or plain wrong. I tried to correct the errors by including factual information. I have no axe to grind. I just like the XXL550M and feel it is a great value in a GPS. I hope this helps you save money and decide on a GPS.PROSIt does EVERYTHING well that others complain about! I can't think of a use this will not accomplish. Are they rating a different GPS? Mine is the XXL550M (free maps) - Hey, could it be that even tho I'm a hi-tech freak, maybe I've just mellowed into an easily satisfied old pansy.The XXL550M has an easy to read 5"" screen, which is not too big - not too small; easy to program (improved software over the XXL540); easy to change the display for individual preference, including voice options and volume; screen display has many readout options to choose from including a compass; fast and accurate map display; the XXL550 has a large 2GB of non-replaceable memory (memory can't be added); automatically adjusts for day/night viewing; easy to move from car to car; good TomTom website support; comes with a nice plastic screen protector; updates with the latest software and maps FREE.NOTE: It comes with a ""stick on"" dash mounting disk. This is important for those in Calif and states that do not allow windshield mounted GPS. (For those just driving through, get or make a large bean bag for a temporary GPS mounting.) It also is good for those who want the GPS closer than a windshield mounting. The disk mounts permanently but the XXL550M can still be moved from car to car. There is a well written, abbreviated manual that gets you going and a complete manual on the Internet. Also included are two cables, one for the car and one for the computer. Best of all, it keeps me from getting lost.CONSNo cons. But you must have (or have a friend, or local library?) with HI SPEED Internet in order to download the software options that make this GPS really usable.My first GPS so can't compare to others but it far exceeds my expectations. It gives me features I did not even think about.SCREEN, FEATURES & OPTIONSExcellent graphics (you can read really tiny 8 point type - but you have toget close to the screen); screen changes automatically for day/night viewing; brightness sets to your preference; Street names given well ahead of arrival; many voice options including manual and automatic volume with auto speed.TomTom encourages users to give feedback on map errors. If my experience is an indication, software updates are frequent (after 3 days TomTom had new free updates when I connected the XXL550 to their website again. The battery must be replaced by TomTom. I expect its life to be about 5 years with proper use. Most battery powered devices will operate on external power even when the battery is worn out. See use and care for Li-Ion batteries. One thing do not keep the GPS on constant charge. Let it fully charge and discharge regularly.I deliberately went way off course and it shows you the way out of any hole you can dig. But it does have a compass too, for those with ""tracker blood"" in their veins. The XXL550 gets warm (not hot) while in use so it must use a lot of power. The battery is rated for 2-3 hours but use the usb cable connected to the cigarette lighter (all necessary cables are included)Too many options to list here, optional screen colors, voices, displays, many  more. There are extra cost options for finding the cheapest gas and other perks you might find useful.It does anything you should need, except to avoid traffic jams. This is covered with an extra cost device and a software package but I know nothing about it.One thought: It seems that an ability to report on traffic jams is time sensitive, very complex and difficult to accomplish quickly, so think about that before you buy. The XXL550 has a usb port, so be careful. DON'T buy this traffic device if it has a pin connection.5"" hi-resolution screen (320 X 240 pix) - good enough for my ancient eyes. I like the 3D view but 2D available.Definitely buy the ""M"" model 4 the free maps. Maps give a GPS its style and usability. New maps don't just give more accuracy and add data.SATELLITE SIGNAL & WEBSITE SUPPORTThe antenna worked well inside my house. Anytime you connect the XXL550M to your computer the TomTom website lets you update with their latest free software. TomTom also offers you the extra cost options. I got a $10 coupon to encourage me to buy, buy, buy.Getting on the TomTom website (the XXL550 connects automatically when hooked to an Internet enabled computer). It may present some problems for anyone not used to how the Internet works. Read the download manual carefully, follow the website instructions and you will be OK. Some things on the TomTom website took a little ""figuring"" but using the download manual was able to do everything without needing Tech Support. (Thus I have no idea about Tech's abilities.)Other Thoughts: To access all features, register and download the TomTom HOME software (must connect to HI SPEED Internet). Nice free features there. This model has 2GB memory, large enough to load most but not all options.PROGRAMMINGSuper easy to program for trips. (My wife programmed our trip - even before we set up the GPS on the Internet) The well thought out design makes it very user friendly. The included manual is short but you can download a complete manual for the ""XL"" GPS (It's the same as the XXL550M except for screen size.) Didn't check if it will program a complex trip with multiple stops but with the ease in programming, I don't see that to be a problem. It does offer an automatic choice to reverse your trip and send you home with no programming needed.MOUNTINGThe window suction mounting device and GPS makes a secure mounting duo when you are sure to lock the GPS into its mount (It does take two hands). The XXL550M has metal spring clips for a secure mount, not cheap plastic that wears out; a well made device. Mounting design makes it easy to remove the GPS, hiding it when leaving the car. The battery lets you take it on a hike but it still thinks you are a car (sorry hiking trails are not on the map). The window mount is easily removed so you can take it on another car.It goes without saying that the windshield should be cleaned before mounting the suction cup (moisten the plastic cup for better adhesion).COMPETITIONI looked at other GPS's and when this is on sale it is by far the best value for the money (Garmin look out). The map is a no-frills but extremely complete and super accurate map. Having used computer maps for years, it is not possible to have a map that is free from errors, so am sure there are some. Hey, it's is not a perfect world.SUMMARYThe GPS also gives an option for driving speed ('course my speedo works too & it's lots bigger). Speed is updated about every 2-3 seconds. This means the GPS updates street names, car position in that same time frame. When streets are close and driving fast, you can ""over drive"" the map data but it did surprisingly well in our 500mi test trip. There may be options other GPS's have but this has more than I need.Considering the distance to and from GPS satellites (a couple thousand miles give or take a city block), and the calculations required of the tiny XXL550M computer, I am surprised at its speed.NOTE: Be sure to download the TomTom free, ""speed"" package. It improves the ability of the XXL550M to access satellite signals and gives it a faster reporting time.Map detail amazes me - it locates me within a few feet. A GPS can only give longitude/latitude; the XXL550M's computer has to take that raw info, map it and show an actual map location - within several feet. All in 2 seconds!

"My first ML-2855ND printer was DOA because the interface circuits on the board were bad. This made it impossible to set up.  I called Samsung tech support because this problem is very unusual (in 25 years working with computers it was a first to have something that seemed to function but would not set up). The printer comes with both usb and network ports and I tried both.They did a quick phone analysis and determined that they would ""fix"" it for the paltry sum of $169. I said that I just bought the printer and wasn't there a guarantee? The response was $169 please. Mine was ""I don't think so.""Samsung states that there is a warranty but this may be some of the new definition for ""transparency"" being floated by some of our leaders. If not, it sure is good old double speak.I contacted the retailer and they exchanged it, even paying for return shipping. This is one of the largest Internet suppliers and I give them ""Egg""cellent feedback for their support.To be fair, I have several Samsung products, including the ML-2855ND printer. All have given me good service but I have become VERY leary of buying Samsung products because of this experience. With this printer, I decided to pay extra for a one year warranty with my replacement printer.It has given me good service for the month I have had it. It installed easily, is quiet and I have no complaints. Will I buy another Samsung product? I honestly don't know. If I do, it will be with great caution and I have to figure in the extra cost for extra warranty.It is a replacement for a very similar ""Brother"" duplex laser printer (main board circuit failure). It should not have died after only 2 years of service. NOTE: Electronic circuits usually fail within 3 to 6 months and then tend to last forever. (The Brother printer was the exception.)[Since I had just bought a new toner cartridge for the Brother, I tried to get it fixed (over $400 and then to buy a new Brother over $300).] This printer was under $160 with the warranty and shipping.Unfortunately, I must give the printer a bad rating because of Samsung. I have never had this kind of experience dealing with computer manufacturer's since I started in this business in the early 1980's.Evaluate this as you deem fit. I have tried to be fair with the printer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MB2SE5XZ1F6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00154IEWG#wasThisHelpful","R2MB2SE5XZ1F6N","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review addresses three areas of a Dake Bible: (1) style and format; (2) size and quality of the versions and (3) what to expect from a Dake Bible (per your Christian growth).As you will see from other reviewers, it is a controversial Bible and we do NOT recommend it as a first study Bible. Right up front, it is impossible for you to determine its worth unless you compare a Dake to other resources. Bibles are very personal choices. Please understand that we believe you can find value in most everything but that also requires enough knowledge to separate truth from fiction.We also mention other resources for comparison, which seem to be absent in other reviews here.FIRST, what to expect from a Dake Bible.You may know that the author, a southern Pentecostal preacher (1902-1987) Finis Dake, devoted his life to creating it. Dake felt guided and inspired by the Holy Spirit to write this Bible. He only wrote comments when he believed he was directed by the Holy Spirit. This is more like a commentary, married to a Bible, than a study Bible. The Dake Bible is the exclusive property of the Dake organization.It is only available as the original King James. The notes are usually on the same page (referenced by verse) as the text, making it an easy reference. The Dake has many insightful comments that you will find informative. Although worthwhile, it is definitely not an ""end all"" resource.Dake also comes in a computer version (my wife uses this exclusively at home, only taking her Dake to church). Other computer Bibles are eSword (free, my preference); The Thompson Chain Reference DVD, Quick verse and others. Look for one than incorporates a STEP reader.Bibles with the Apocrypha include the Jerusalem Bible, which is similar to the NIV in literary style (our preference); the New Revised Standard Version with the Apocrypha by Henderson among others. Henderson publishes some wonderful Christian resources at affordable prices.If you are a student of the King James, also examine a Thompson Chain Reference Bible. Both this and the Dake are unique in that they represent a lifetime work. The Thompson is possibly the most comprehensive Bible as an all-in-one resource, with more depth than the Dake but lacking in Dake's personal and sometimes controversial touch. They are so different, they cannot be compared. The Chain Reference's disadvantage is that it is difficult to learn and effectively use - but worth the effort. Note, there are study courses (link [...]) and a DVD computer program is available.DO NOT buy the NIV version of Thompson's. It is a remarkably poor attempt to marry Thompson's references to the radically different NIV translation.If you are inclined to more English language friendly, translations - consider a Life Application Study Bible or an Open Bible, (New King James). We stop here not because there are no other good study Bibles but because this is not a book about Bibles. We own over a dozen different Bibles and have had three Dake Bibles.Because Dake's notes are extensive (they are longer than the Bible text), we suggest getting the expanded or large print version, unless you have the eyes of an eagle (even in the large version, the print of the notes is small). NOTE: None of the Dake users we know accept ALL of Dake's Biblical interpretations.For these reasons, we strongly suggest that you borrow or at least peruse a book store copy before buying one. Also, read our section on ""size and quality"" before coming to a decision. We are very UNHAPPY with our latest Dake. Some, who buy a Dake Bible on impulse, wind up putting it on a shelf.The bottom line is that (with reservation) this can expand your Christian faith, providing you are a serious student of the Bible. If you want to really understand God's Word, you will find a Dake useful but for more ""eye opening"" revelations, read or hear from books and tapes by Messianic Rabbis.A knowledgeable Messianic Jew can put together the Old and New Testaments in ways not possible with almost all Christian authors, including Dake.Some examples: The life of Jesus met all of the rules Jews required for a betrothal and marriage (if you aren't sure of its significance, please look it up). The crucifixion of Jesus met all the requirements for a ceremonial sacrifice. There are many, many more, few are even on a Christian's radar. The value here is that it will strengthen your understanding of Jesus, His love for us all and the special place Jesus has for Jews and how integrated He was in Jewish life and culture. Jesus did not turn His back on Jews, rather He offered God to all men.SIZE AND QUALITYFor size, we much prefer the larger versions (we are getting old). For type, we buy genuine leather (money available) because they last for decades. That is until we bought our latest Dake. Their genuine leather version was made it China. China makes some of the world's finest harmonicas; we don't generally trash Chinese products. They are more than capable, when they put their mind to producing quality.DO NOT BUY THE DAKE, GENUINE LEATHER BIBLE.Save your money and get imitation leather, vinyl, hardback or the DVD computer version. We hope the other Bibles are not made in China. You may want to check on this before making your purchase.It is sub-standard. The leather is not top grain but a sorry cut of leather. The gold, ""edge page"" guilding is rapidly wearing off our new Dake. In comparison, we have no problem with any of our US made Bibles; some are more than 30 years old. The leather of this cheap Dake's remains stiff, with a plastic feel not characteristic of any but the cheapest cuts of leather. This is despite our repeated treating the leather with the best leather softening products available. A top grain leather is soft and supple. With occasional treating, good leather improves with age and does not deteriorate. My first Bible, a Scofield Study Bible, with a genuine leather cover is in marvelous condition after almost four decades. Also, all of our other leather Bibles have a facing leather inside cover. The cheap, Dake Bible even messes up on this standard feature.We wrote the Dake organization asking for a comment but were ignored.STYLE AND FORMATThe large print version necessarily expands the comments (large print takes up more space than small). This means that more of the comments must be shifted to other pages. We mention this because one of the nice features of a Dake is that much of the commentary is on the same page as the referenced Bible text. Look both over as this becomes a personal decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRCVIOFVKSCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1558290877#wasThisHelpful","R1YRCVIOFVKSCO","A19JLVWKE8KY0Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JLVWKE8KY0Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm using the Marantz SR6009 as the centerpiece of my audio system. To cut to the chase, it is a fine sounding, well provisioned, and fully featured receiver for playing recorded music. Once you complete the initial setup, the SR6009 is a joy to listen to. Do keep in mind, though, that this receiver does not have Tape Monitor inputs and outputs, as used to be the standard for stereo equipment.Now then, on to the details for those interested...My Reviewing Perspective*Prior to obtaining the SR6009, I was using a Harman/Kardon receiver with a pair of 2-way Paradigm 3se speakers, a turntable, a cassette tape deck, a 10-band per channel equalizer, and two CD players.*I mostly listen to non-music radio broadcasts, both AM and FM, rock, jazz, and classical. I don't like a lot of low end and set the midrange as the lowest part of my equalization curve. For music, CDs are my primary source, followed by vinyl, self-recorded cassettes, and digital files.*Most of my digital music has been self-ripped in a lossy format for mobile listening. I don't own many commercially produced MP3, AAC, or other digital music files.Setup*It is easiest to first setup the SR6009 with a TV/monitor, a Wi-Fi network, and, if you own one, an Apple iOS device available. When the receiver is powered up for the first time, a few screens take you through the steps required to establish a wireless connection and do some basic configuration.*Using Apple Airplay on iOS makes joining your wireless network especially simple.*Once the SR6009 is capable of joining your Wi-Fi network, all the setup, configuration, and maintenance settings are accessible via a web browser. Anybody who has administered a Wi-Fi router through a web browser will find working with the Marantz browser function to be familiar and straightforward.*Something I was not accustomed to from my old system was having to manually associate specific input jacks with each output setting. That is, I had to, for example, set the SR6009 to use ""Analog Audio In #5"" when ""CD"" is selected on the front of the receiver. I don't view this as a flaw, of course, because it increases setup flexibility. But it's something to keep in mind, especially if you are upgrading from older equipment as I was.Operation*Since I'm using the SR6009 as an audio receiver only, my setup differs from home theatre setups because I do not have a TV or monitor permanently connected to the receiver.*The combination of the remote control, the front display, and the browser-based management function are sufficient for full control of the receiver (note that the Marantz app for smartphones does not provide full access to settings, so you cannot rely on the app for tweaking and adjusting).*Even though the front panel and display are minimalist, using and controlling the SR6009 in day-to-day use is intuitive and uncomplicated.What I Like*There is an extensive set of input and output jacks, which provides lots of possibilities for expansion and reconfiguration.*Phono inputs and a grounding terminal are built in. Viva vinyl!*Streaming music from my iMac (running OS X Yosemite) and iDevices (iOS 8) is extremely easy and seamless using AirPlay.*I have my primary CD player connected through one of the Coaxial Digital inputs, and I've been rediscovering my CD collection. Most of my discs now sound richer and more detailed. To my ears, Marantz has put an excellent digital-to-analog converter into the receiver.*Most importantly, the SR6009 produces clear and pure sound, with an amplifier that handles highly dynamic music with aplomb. It performs very well with the kinds of music I listen to, at the (often loud) volumes I enjoy.Caveats*There is no Tape Monitor functionality, so I've retired my standalone equalizer. This was a conscious tradeoff: I now have slightly less granular control over the output tone but have gained a direct digital connection from CD player to receiver (the built-in equalizer function has nine bands at 63 Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, and 16 kHz).*The lack of Tape Monitor also means owners of three-head tape decks lose the ability to monitor recording quality in real time.*There is only one set of Pre Out jacks. Again, this can affect people with tape decks because another, more frequently used component might need the connection.*While special equalization for compressed digital files is available (""M-DAX""), lossy formats still do not sound very good at higher volumes. They're somewhat improved at the high and low ends, but the midrange remains fuzzy, distorted, and indistinct. Don't expect miracles...*If you do not keep your Wi-Fi network running 24/7 and the SR6009 is set to maintain wireless access in Standby mode, the SR6009 must be manually rejoined to the network after your router powers-up (this seems to happen because the receiver cannot change its IP address when set this way).The Bottom Line*The Marantz SR6009 is a well-designed, fine sounding audio receiver. It is a great choice for bringing older sound systems into the present day, unless you are strongly attached to making recordings on a tape deck or love playing with your graphic equalizer. Four stars.----------Update (April 2015): No problems to report after two months of daily use and two firmware updates over Wi-Fi.Update (July 2015): No problems to report after several months of daily use.Update (November 2015): No problems to report (still using daily).

"Icebreaker's Drifter Hood is a very comfortable, pared down midlayer or light outer layer. It's great for times when you might think about throwing on a fleece pullover but don't want all the zips, cords, pockets, loud colors, and other features that scream OUTDOORS GEAR!!!I do have a couple of caveats. First, Icebreaker has decreased the wool content of the fabric for this season (Fall 2014). I own both an older and the current version; the newer material feels less wooly and more slippery-synthetic. I think the fabric is equally comfortable but it doesn't drape as nicely as before. Second, the Drifter Hood has a slimmer cut than other Icebreaker garments. I usually take a Medium with Icebreaker but I found I like the fit of a Large size Drifter better.Four stars, for a wool-blend top that is great for lounging, breezy evenings on a patio, or hanging out at a brewpub.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXHNRZA18JX0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4GOAW6#wasThisHelpful","RXHNRZA18JX0R","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using the Speck StyleFolio with a first generation iPad Mini. The case is a fine solution for when you don't want to drag around a heavy, super-rugged case (like a Pelican or OtterBox) but need more protection than a simple screen protector/stand (such as the Apple Smart Cover).Things I like*Not heavy or bulky*A plastic shell fully encompasses the back of the iPad and holds the case on very securely*Many landscape oriented tilt positions, including for typing*Snapping closure both keeps the case closed and locks the cover out of the way when holding tablet in portrait positions*Full access to all ports and buttons maintainedCaveats*The case doesn't support portrait oriented tilt positions. You have to hold the iPad in your hands.*Using the rear camera is awkward because the front flap of the case covers the lens when the case is open. In order to take pictures or shoot video, you need to partially fold the flap and hold it away from the camera opening.*My case arrived with sloppy or frayed stitching in a few places. Speck provides a 1-year warranty so if the cover does begin to self-destruct, I hope it's within the next twelve months.Bottom line: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because I don't use the rear camera on my iPad much and the poor stitching, while somewhat disappointing, does not make the case unusable out of the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8QSRE9HLAP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY3EEJW#wasThisHelpful","RK8QSRE9HLAP6","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am using the TP-LINK UH700 USB hub with my PS4. Since Sony only provides two USB ports on the console, a hub is a must-buy for anybody who wants to do more than just plug in game controllers. I've got a couple of DualShocks, a Turtle Bay audio transmitter, Turtle Bay headphones, and a Microsoft keyboard hooked up to the hub.Things I like*Slim, compact footprint. The hub is about half the size of a game disc case in length, width, and thickness.*Independently powered. This means less wear and tear on the PS4's power supply and less heat to disperse from the console. I would rather replace a USB hub than send in the PS4 for an inconvenient and expensive repair job.*On-off switch. Unlike many powered USB hubs, the UH700 has a power switch that lets you turn off the hub when it's not being used.One minor thing that would make the UH700 better would be a slimmer adapter.

"Anybody who goes to see live music that is pumped through a PA system, even in bars and small clubs, is familiar with the GIG DILEMMA: I know it's incredibly flippin' loud in here but these foam cylinders make it sound like we're 50 feet underwater! So a lot of the time, you end up taking out your earplugs and dealing with ringing ears for a couple of days or, worse, long-term hearing damage.The DUBS Acoustic Filters are a great solution to this problem. They are designed to provide both less overall noise reduction (foam plugs typically claim around 30 dB while the DUBS are rated at 12 dB) and better musical fidelity than cheap roll-and-insert plugs.  Now you can ""turn the volume down"" a bit at a show but still be able to hear high and middle range sounds. Ride cymbal fans, rejoice!Wearing the DUBS feels similar to wearing earbuds or a Bluetooth earpiece. A spherical soft-rubber gasket holds the DUBS in your ear canal. Unfortunately only one size of gasket is included, so you're stuck if the plugs feel uncomfortable or don't fit well. Further, a lanyard or neck cord attachment points would be a significant improvement. If you drop a plug or one falls out of your ear, it's going to hit the ground. That's not a good thing at a crowded, sticky-floored joint or in a muddy, trampled festival field.Now for the most important thing: how do the DUBS sound? To my ears, they are biased towards the low end, with slightly boomy bass. If you already own Beats headphones or think subwoofers are one of the greatest inventions ever, you'll like wearing DUBS.Bottom line: DUBS Acoustic Filters are a vast improvement over foam earplugs...but could use a couple of minor design changes. Four stars, particularly if you always hang out near the bass bins or love kick drum.----------Note:If you prefer a more even and balanced sound, take a look at Etymotic Research ER20 earplugs--I've owned a pair for several years and like them as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PWC3SJTK9ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW1IZ5Q#wasThisHelpful","R20PWC3SJTK9ZN","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is this disc? Is it an album? Is it a jam session? Or is it a document of an ephemeral work of art that cannot ever be exactly duplicated? Or, as some would have it, is this an elaborate joke at the expense of Savages and Bo Ningen fans?Well, if you agree that a signed urinal or an image of a dusty piece of glass can belong in a gallery, Words to the Blind might be to your liking. As a live, Dada-influenced event performed in an art space, this 37-minute work is deliberately meant to challenge and provoke listeners. It's about as far from a fist-pumping, lighter-waving, sing-along gig as you can get. The sleeve even includes a manifesto and artistic statement of purpose for the record.Musically the piece owes more to Sonny Sharrock and electric Miles Davis than it does to rock. It's simultaneously driving and complex, with overlapping, sometimes oppositional playing. Things never devolve into total cacophony or chaos though; both bands keep to a fairly linear, accesible path throughout. Listeners don't have to worry about keeping up or possibly getting lost as they do with, say, Ornette Coleman or Sun Ra.So, yes, I do like Words to the Blind. But keep in mind I also like free jazz and Surrealist art and literature...","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ISSNN0SZ1Q3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3E6JZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1ISSNN0SZ1Q3M","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Woods was the sound of (three) radioactive elements kept in close proximity imploding and the resulting catastrophic explosion that destroyed everything around it.  Turbulent, manic, and distorted, raging with the heat and light of a thousand suns, Sleater-Kinney's last album was, above all, UNHINGED and seemingly the apocalyptic end of a rrritous era.But somehow, somehow, they're back! And on this album, No Cities to Love, S-K has managed to hang on to all the power and energy that elevated The Woods over their previous work. The difference is now it's used to build instead of to destroy. Gone is the obscuring veil of fuzz and over-compression, leaving a walloping yet incredibly precise sound.The time apart allowed all three band members to add even more to their formidable chops. Carrie Brownstein's voice remains passionate but is now much more controlled, Janet Weiss' drumming is even more agile and inventive, and Corin Tucker can now swing it on her vocals like an indie rock Ella Fitzgerald (check out Gimme Love, it's almost like she's scatting with the drums and guitars, yow!).Intricate arrangements and amazing musicianship don't have to lead to self-indulgence, though. This record is much more concise and pared down than The Woods. None of the songs meander or contain anything superfluous. Every element fits into the whole and serves a purpose...at 32 minutes in total length, there just isn't time for wanking, noodling around, or tangents.Don't believe any of this? Check out the samples. Then pick up a copy of the album. Longtime fans will love the chance to hear fresh material from a band that seemed like it had called it quits. New listeners will be rewarded by a set with crystalline sonics, great hooks, and impassioned playing and singing that is a fine entry point to Sleater-Kinney.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ROXZ1C289UNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPMI3N0#wasThisHelpful","R2ROXZ1C289UNO","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ibex, for anybody unfamiliar with it, is a Vermont company that specializes in wool garments and accessories. Almost its entire product line is manufactured in the USA.Ramble pants are made from heavy weight wool. While both the raw wool and the twill fabric are sourced from outside the US, according to the Ibex website, the garment itself is made in Northern California. The grey color is not a pure grey; in strong light it  takes on a slight brown/orange cast (you can see this effect for yourself in the Ramble's product pictures on the REI website).The construction is very sturdy. The waist fastens using a rubber-rimmed snap, which is more robust and reliable than a sewn-on button. The high-stress areas at the top and bottom of the pockets are reinforced with rivets, as on Levi's jeans. All the stitching and sewing is high quality. The Ramble, with proper care, should last for years and years.In actual use, these pants are very comfortable to wear. They are cut like rock climbing pants, with plenty of room for a base layer underneath and a loose, mobile fit in the upper legs. The upper inseam/crotch is gusseted for even more freedom of movement. Overall, the look is clean and tailored enough for informal workplaces but retains enough of an outdoorsy feel for travel and active uses. And even though they're unlined, the pants don't ever feel itchy because they're made of merino wool.The only things I would change would be to add two more belt loops, have the factory do a better job of clipping loose threads after sewing is completed (at this price point I expect a cleaner finished garment), and offer short, regular, and long inseam options. These are quibbles, in any case, and don't take much away from a very comfortable, functional, and warm pair of pants.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XP0WS1N4NXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSAB4O0#wasThisHelpful","R26XP0WS1N4NXO","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried the Oxo Good Grips Shower/Tub Drain Protector as a replacement for a drain cover with a different, flatter design. The Protector was placed in a shower/tub combo.I've returned to using my older cover because the Oxo Protector does not stay in place over the drain as well, especially when water is flowing from the faucet spigot directly onto the Protector. Even though the Oxo has a weight on the top, its bottom lip is not wide enough to keep it from frequently shifting out of position.A wider lip would make the Drain Protector a very good product. The current design, however, does not work well in my bathroom. If I had a stall shower or a tub where the drain was offset from the taps, I think I would like it a lot better.Three stars--it does work nicely once in its proper place over the drain.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REROW339N8H2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEBMFM#wasThisHelpful","REROW339N8H2R","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The problem is that the Thumb Grips come off too easily while playing.

"This thick all-wool coat is a great piece for anybody who wants a comfortable and subtly styled outer layer...and is a little nostalgic for that high school classic, the letterman jacket.The Europa has a generous, boxy cut with plenty of room to spare, especially in the sleeves (sound familiar, former varsity athletes?). Details are sparse; this garment is unlined and has only two exterior handwarmer pockets. All the zippers (one main, two pocket) are high quality YKK chain zippers that slide easily. The main attraction, of course, is the loden wool. It is a sturdy, dense fabric that is very effective at holding in warmth. It's a little rough to the touch but a cool thing is that you can feel the lanolin in the wool fibers.Overall, the Ibex Europa is a nice casual jacket for around town use. It is understated and mellow and cozy. I do think it's too bulky and too minimally featured for demanding outdoors or non-cushy travel use though.Four stars.

All the devices I connect to the Nighthawk X4 were previously configured for the Linksys router's wired/wireless network.*The i7 iMac is my primary machine and the one I use to administrate the wired and wireless networks provided by the router.*I'm not an engineer or a tech geek. As such, I won't be discussing bandwidth, throughput, error rates, or other quantitative measurements in this review.Setup:*Setup and configuration on my administrator iMac was very simple. I used the ""Genie"" automated setup. It was able to automatically configure both WAN and LAN settings on its own. Total time: about 5 minutes.*During setup, the application asked for the DSL login information I use with my ISP.*Genie downloads a router management application to your computer that must be installed before setup is 100% complete. The app is about 50 MB. Unfortunately, it doesn't run on Snow Leopard but it doesn't seem to be necessary for operating and accessing the router.*My G4 iMac and PS3 were able to access the network over Ethernet immediately after plugging them into the router.Pros:*The power adapter has a narrow, rectangular profile. Anybody using a plug strip will appreciate the adapter's skinny footprint.*According to the Shields Up firewall checking website (grc,com), the built-in firewall is set to complete stealth mode by default.*In addition to using Genie, the router can be configured via web browser. Browser-based configuration also provides access to advanced settings.*The browser-based management screens are easy to read, understand, and navigate.*The router offers a secure (WPA2) guest wireless signal that is hived off from the rest of the network.Cons:*This router is pretty big, about the size of a ream of letter-sized paper, and has four antennas that stick up from it. It ain't pretty and you can't really hide it from view. *There isn't a way to change the login name used to configure the router (it is easy to change the password, though).*There are a lot of lights on top of the router. When the router has a lot going on, all the flashing and brightness can be distracting. There is a switch on the back panel, though, that turns off all the lights except for a power indicator.Operation:*The router takes a lot longer than my old router to start up from a powered down state. This won't bother anybody who leaves their router on 24/7.*No problems with the wired connections to my DSL modem, desktop computers, and PS3.*No problems with the connections to my wireless devices.*I live in a densely populated area--both people and WiFi networks--and the router seems to be effective at both avoiding interference and maintaining contact with whatever is connected to it.*The signal quality is stronger and more stable than with my old router. Rooms that used to need a WiFi repeater for good connectivity now receive a decent signal.*Both high bandwidth activities, such as streaming video, and general `Net surfing are handled well by the router.*Multiple connections, wired and wireless, are handled well by the router. Lower priority devices will experience slowdowns when the network has multiple users but that's by design! The important thing is that the person watching a movie or playing an online game won't be affected much when someone else just wants to do a quick email check or sync a Kindle bookmark.Bottom line: The Netgear Nighthawk X4 is a fine router for Mac users. It is just as easy to setup as an Apple product. It provides a robust signal in both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, even in an environment full of other WiFi networks and devices.

"I'm using the Sennheiser PX 685i headphones with an iPhone 5c.I like them. I think they produce nicely balanced, clear sound, are more comfortable to wear than earbuds (especially for long periods), and work well with Siri, phone functions, and voice-enabled apps.However, it is worthwhile looking at the negative reviews here too. These 'phones clearly don't fit every ear shape comfortably. And if you are somebody who loves lots of bass, likes the extremely tight fit of earbuds or sound isolating earphones, or wants a blingy accessory that screams how expensive it is, these Senns aren't for you. But if you want a pair of headphones that let your music stretch out and breathe while also giving you full hands-free access to your iPhone--at a moderate price to boot!--give the PX 685i a try.Four stars.----------One more thing...Sennheiser should redesign the plug. If you use an iPhone case that does not leave a lot of open space around the headphone jack, the plug cannot be fully inserted into the jack.

"Ibex, for anybody unfamiliar with it, is a Vermont company that specializes in wool garments and accessories. Almost its entire product line is made in the USA.The Recycled Felted Wool Commuter Bag is a minimalist, cleanly designed and constructed messenger-style bag. The fabric is a felt made from a blend of recycled wool and artificial fibers. It is extremely lightweight and has a very visually interesting finish, with spots of various colors popping out from a grey background. It looks cool and is nice to touch.If you like lots of pockets, slots, zippers, and closures on your bags, the Commuter is not for you. It has two places to hold stuff: a slash pocket underneath the main flap and a roomy main compartment that has a soft cloth divider to create a laptop/tablet holder. That's pretty much it. The strap has an unmovable wool pad but can be adjusted on either end using the twin buckles. Closing the bag is simple yet effective. Just pull the two metal toggles (they're attached with elastic to the inside of the bag) through their respective metal-reinforced holes.Overall size and capacity fall in between Timbuk2 Small and Medium messenger bags. A laptop, some papers, and a small water bottle will fit nicely. Bulky or puffy items, however, don't work too well because the bag is fairly narrow and doesn't expand much.I think there are two important things to know before buying the Commuter. First, the felt is not waterproof or water resistant and the bag does not have any kind of waterproof liner. Second, the combination of the simple shoulder strap suspension and the lack of a cross-body strap make the Commuter unsuitable for serious bike riding. It's more of a public transit or car bag than a bike messenger bag, despite its styling.Other than that, I like carrying the Commuter Bag and it has a very unique look to it.

"Let's cut to the chase. The two big questions about this new, massively hyped jacket are:1. What is FullRange insulation?2. Why do I need the Nano-Air after Patagonia has been pushing its Capilene base layer-Regulator fleece midlayer-hard/soft shell outer layer system for so long?The first answer is simple. FullRange is Patagonia's proprietary version of Polartec Alpha insulation. Both FullRange and Alpha are extremely lightweight and breathable and remain warm when wet. FullRange, according to Patagonia, is stretchier than Alpha.Now, then, whether you need a Nano-Air depends mostly on if you often use an insulation layer between your fleece and shell layers. The Nano-Air is a big improvement over down or older synthetics if you do because the Nano-Air is just as light and thin as the others, the Nano-Air's insulation AND materials are fully breathable, and the Nano-Air's outer shell has a soft, cotton-like hand.What the Nano-Air is not good at is acting as an outer layer in windy, damp, or wet conditions. Its shell material is not waterproof and, by design, air moves very easily through all parts of the garment.In actual use, the Nano-Air is very comfortable and well designed. It has a fit similar to most insulation pieces, where it is roomier than most midlayers but still slim enough to go easily under a hard or soft shell jacket. There are three outer pockets, one chest and two waist (if you want two chest pockets, get the Nano-Air Hoody). Each pocket is welted so that the entire outside of the jacket is flat and free of obstructions. Another good feature is the drawstrings at the hem for cinching down the bottom part of the jacket. The cuffs, though, are not adjustable in any way.A welcome change from many other Patagonia jackets is that the main zipper is a chain zipper, not a coil zipper. Yes, it's a gear geek point but chain zippers are stronger than coil, require less force to slide, and are easy to repair out in the field.Cleaning the Nano-Air is easy, since you don't have to deal with down or worry about maintaining a pristine DWR finish. When it gets dirty or funky, you can just toss it into the washing machine. It air-dries fairly quickly but can also handle some time in a coolish dryer. Nice!Bottom line: the Nano-Air is a great improvement over Patagonia's older insulation layers, such as the Down Sweater and the Nano Puff Hoody. The one thing to keep in mind is that its outer shell is not the usual shiny, slippery, water resistant material found in similar garments. As such, the Nano-Air is not much of a defense against wind and water on its own. Don't leave home without a robust outer layer if you're not assured of fair weather!----------NoteComparison shoppers should take a look at the Marmot Isotherm Jacket. It uses Polartec Alpha and has a more traditional slick nylon outer material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FCRH4RCAN2GU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSJ1RPW#wasThisHelpful","R3FCRH4RCAN2GU","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yep, I'm going 5 stars on the Contigo Cortland Water Bottle. Why? I've been searching for something like this for a long time: a lightweight yet sturdy water bottle that is slightly smaller than a standard Nalgene, has a self-attached cap, and has a robust leakproof closure.I have the 24 oz. model of the Cortland. It has all the features I was looking for plus a built-in carabiner-style clip. It is now my go-to bottle whenever I don't want to carry a full-on quart sized bottle. The only time I would not recommend the Cortland is when you're somewhere that requires you to purify your own water. The interior of the cap has a lot of crevices and tight spaces, due to the sealing mechanism, and is difficult to keep sanitary without ready access to hot, clean water.Overall, Contigo has made an excellent bottle that is well suited for commuting, work, school, and most travel and outdoors use. The Cortland is now part of my core gear kit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4J1AJVAS8PU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVODHO4#wasThisHelpful","R4J1AJVAS8PU6","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, here's something important to know: if the product photo is accurate, the Nano Puff Hybrid on offer here is the first generation version from Fall 2012. That's actually a good thing because the current version has a much smaller fleece zone and has waist pockets instead of chest pockets. For active use, the earlier design is a lot more functional and this is an opportunity to get one.I own the original version in the blue/green color combo and, to be truthful, I love the way it looks but it hasn't become one of my favorite pieces. Why? Mainly because the Hybrid is stuck in the middle--it's not a full-on soft and toasty R2 fleece jacket but it's also not an all-over abrasion resistant, windproof Nano Puff jacket. I can't quite decide if it's best as an outer layer or a midlayer. It is incredibly lightweight and compressible, though, and is comfortable to wear. I mostly use it around town and for carry on-only airplane travel now. It does get a lot of comments due to its unique look!Three stars (unless you've spent the last few years lusting for a jacket that is mostly a Nano Puff in the front and a R2 in the back and lower torso...then it's a five star dream come true).

"I like using the Nano Puff Vest as an outer layer, either in 50˚F and above temperatures or as backup insulation during non-sweaty activities. The PrimaLoft fill is extremely lightweight and compressible, but the polyester shell and lining do not breathe very well. So, the vest holds heat in nicely but can quickly become clammy if you're working hard.The fit is fairly slim but not as tight as some of Patagonia's other technical garments, such as the R1 Hoody and Pullover or the Piton Hybrid Vest. It's actually pretty close to how classic Synchilla vests are cut, now that I'm thinking about it.Overall, the Nano Puff is well designed with the exception of the zippers. It is very easy to get the vest's fabric caught up in the zipper sliders, especially the pocket linings. You have to remember to be careful when opening and closing the pockets!Four stars for a good alternative to down-fill vests, particularly in rainy conditions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJEXOROPX8RW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ1LF16#wasThisHelpful","RJEXOROPX8RW9","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're familiar with Patagonia's classic fleece vests, the best way to think of the Piton Hybrid Vest is what happens when a Synchilla Vest goes on a diet and gets serious about staying active.The two Polartec fleeces used in the Piton, Wind Pro and Power Dry, are thinner, lighter, stretchier, and a lot more compressible than Synchilla. Both fabrics have a smooth outer finish to make donning a shell over the vest easier. The overall design of the Piton is geared to people who want a very close fitting garment with a long hem (the extra length helps the vest stay put under a harness or backpack waist belt) for climbing or backpacking.In actual use, the Wind Pro does block more wind than regular fleece, including technical fleeces such as Patagonia's R1 or the material used in Marmot's Alpinist Tech Jacket, but definitely isn't windproof. The Power Dry sections wick and breathe effectively while providing some heat retention. As you would expect, though, the Piton doesn't insulate as much as the similarly light and thin Nano Puff Vest.So think carefully about what you want out of your vest before picking up a Piton Hybrid. The Piton is not soft and cozy like Synchilla. It won't store as much heat as a down or Nano Puff vest. It has a slim and clingy fit. But the Piton is extremely lightweight, has lots of stretch, works well with packs and harnesses, and layers easily.Four stars, keeping in mind the Piton's intended users and uses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R399KCG81PRK2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006887DTE#wasThisHelpful","R399KCG81PRK2Z","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using the Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4 wireless headphones with my ""fat"" 60Gb PS3. Overall, I am very satisfied, although I have a few quibbles.What I like*Setup was easy. All you have to do is connect the PX4's base station to the PS3's Optical jack and to one of the USB ports. Then set the PS3 to send audio to the Optical jack, if it wasn't already configured to do so. If you have another A/V component that needs an optical audio signal, the base station passes the signal through, even when the headphones aren't being used.*The headset is reasonably well made and comfortable to wear for long periods. No, the build quality and materials are not up to the standard of those AKG or Denon studio cans you've had your eye on but the PX4 does the job well enough in my opinion.*There are lots of configuration options, including the placement of the virtual speakers in the soundfield, a volume limiter, peak sound limiting, and mic sensitivity.*I also have a home theater audio system hooked up to the PS3 and the PX4 works seamlessly alongside it. When I'm not using the headphones, the base station automatically turns itself off and doesn't interfere with anything.*Most importantly, the PX4 system generates a soundfield with good separation and presence for the virtual speakers and the headphones sound more than good enough for gaming.Caveats*The base station does not support DTS sound. This can be a pain if a game does not allow configuring its sound output within the game because you then have to fiddle with the PS3's Optical output settings to force Dolby output. You also have to remember to return the settings to their original configuration.*For the most part, the wireless connectivity is clear and trouble-free. However, I live in an area where there are lots of Wi-Fi networks overlapping each other. When there is a lot of Wi-Fi activity going on, the sound can suffer from dropouts and static.*An extremely minimalistic Quick Start guide is the only documentation provided in the box. Turtle Bay should pack in at least a stripped-down manual so that quickly checking how a feature works or how to change a setting doesn't require firing up another device.Bottom line: all you need to know, really, is that once you start playing with the headphones on, you forget you're wearing them and quickly become immersed in the game. Four stars, keeping in mind that people living in places with a lot of Wi-Fi traffic might find wired headphones to be a better choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VW3HHOXTJQ0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHV0XV0#wasThisHelpful","R3VW3HHOXTJQ0I","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 2013 redesign of the R1 Pullover made it the best midlayer fleece for active use today. It goes well beyond everything else currently available in both form and function.Patagonia shifted from a single fabric design to a zonal, dual fabric construction. The main body of the pullover uses a fleece that is very light weight and compressible yet warm, while areas that often get damp (underarms, underarm gussets, collar, cuffs) use an even lighter and faster drying fleece. Both fabrics have a smooth, shiny finish to make layering over the garment easier.The key to the high performance of the fleece fabrics is how they are made. Small squares of fleece are woven in a grid pattern on the inner face of a stretchy, translucent backing. This gives the fabrics the ability to be both warm and breathable. The fleece squares hold warm air while the thin backing allows moisture and vapor to pass between each square, unimpeded. Much better than earlier generation fleece!Other details which set the R1 apart are thumbholes on the sleeves, cuffs that stay put when pushed up, an extra long main zipper that makes it easy to dump lots of heat quickly, and a chest pocket that doubles as a second heat vent.My only caveats are that the cut and fit are fairly slim since the R1 needs to fit under a shell or other outer layer and, yes, it costs a lot more than those boxy, heavy el-cheapo fleeces that are a common sight at discount and fast-fashion stores. But if you want your fleece to be more than just a glorified baby's blanket, the R1 Pullover is well worth its price. And let's face it, if you don't lead a reasonably active lifestyle, you don't need this kind of technical garment.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7YFW7HGI2DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M45VUZI#wasThisHelpful","RY7YFW7HGI2DS","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been trying out various types of eco-bulbs over the last few years, both fluorescent and LED. The Kobi Electric K8L6 LED bulb is one of the best I've used. I have it installed in an eight-bulb chandelier fixture alongside several other makers' eco-bulbs. It currently gets 3-4 hours of daily use, which will increase to 5-7 hours per day as we move into late autumn and winter.What I like*The bulb generates bright light evenly over the entire surface of its globe. A lot of LED bulbs have dark zones.*Instant-on. Unlike CFL bulbs, LED bulbs reach their full brightness immediately after turning them on and, even better, are not harmed by frequent on-off cycles.*Opaque globe. This bulb is bright enough to use an opaque material for the globe, which helps to make the light warmer. Another benefit is that the bulb's appearance is unobtrusive. Some LED bulbs, due to clear globes or by design, have a high tech look that is not always desirable.*No mercury, so no haz-mat handling is required when the bulb ""burns out"" (many years from now).Four stars, subject to revision in a few months.----------Update (February 2015): no problems to report.Update (September 2015): no problems to report.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E9QA5HR3W4RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9WRUNQ#wasThisHelpful","R1E9QA5HR3W4RY","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes, the OXO Good Grips 8-inch Chef Knife is very comfortable to hold, due to its well-designed handle, and won't stress your bank account much. But the blade is too lightweight for extended use or for easily cutting through anything that is thick or dense.Even though it may seem counterintuitive, a heavier blade actually is less fatiguing and more precise than the thin, light blades found on most budget knives.  So anybody who does a lot of prep work or cooks daily probably should step up to a professional (or at least ""pro-sumer"") quality knife.

"The best thing about the OXO Good Grips 5-Inch Utility Knife is that it has a very good handle. The handle is comfortable to hold, has been designed to give you a lot of leverage over the blade, and cleans up easily.Obviously, given the price(!), this knife is not a heavy-duty or professional caliber knife. The blade does OK with soft ingredients and breads but its thin metal construction makes it too flexible for general use. Plus sharpening will cost more than buying another knife (it's best to have serrated knives professionally sharpened). That's not a good way to operate in my book...So, I think the Utility Knife could be an acceptable choice for casual or occasional cooks but anybody who works in the kitchen regularly will want a knife with a heavier, more robust blade.

"The Victorinox Santoku and Steak Knife Set is a good way to try out a santoku style knife without breaking the bank and also get a set of everyday-quality steak knives in the bargain.First, let's talk about the santoku. It feels very lightweight in the hand and when sharp, is easy to maneuver. No special cleaning or care is necessary since the blade is stainless steel and the handle is made from Fibrox, a tough material derived from silica, calcium, alumina, and a few other minerals (see the comments to this review for a link to more info on Fibrox). Ordinary chopping and dicing of vegetables and other soft ingredients is no problem; however, for working with meat and carcasses, I think a heavier knife is more effective and easier to work with.The steak knives are fine for general use but, in my opinion, feel and look a bit too insubstantial and informal for entertaining.Bottom line: I think the Victorinox Santoku is a knife that can either serve as a decent general purpose knife for casual or infrequent cooks or as a way for serious home cooks to see if a santoku fits into their workflow before committing to a professional quality version. The steak knives are functional but not particularly special in any way. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 since you get five Swiss-made knives at a value price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBUJFR6XANRQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFLTR4#wasThisHelpful","RBUJFR6XANRQD","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The De'Longhi Dolce Gusto Circolo is a nicely designed and well-constructed coffee maker. It is easy to operate and clean. What comes out of it varies greatly in intensity, flavor, and aroma. I think it works best for straight espresso and for hot chocolate.|My Reviewing Perspective|I drink a lot of coffee. At home I make it using either a drip machine or a French press and drink it black. When I want an espresso or anything involving steamed milk, I go to a coffee house or coffee bar. I stick to the basics and very rarely add syrups, sweeteners, or flavorings.|Why the Circolo Interested Me|Sometimes I'm in the mood for an espresso but can't be bothered to go out. I also sometimes get a craving for coffee at night but not often enough to keep a supply of decaffeinated beans around the house. So the Circolo seemed like a good way to be able to make the occasional espresso or cup of decaf without a lot of fuss and without having to store several varieties of beans.|General Thoughts|*The Circolo has an interesting, oval design. It looks much more graceful than most small kitchen electrics.*All the parts fit well and are sturdily made. With proper care, this machine should last for a long time.*The major disadvantage of the Circolo is that it only accepts Nescafé Dolce Gusto capsules. Owners are currently locked into using only the coffees sold by Nestlé.*There are no single country-source coffees (there is no way to get my favorite coffee, Kenya AA, for example) nor any specialized blends (say, Fair Trade) available. Further, Dolce Gusto capsules do not seem to be widely distributed in the US. I live in a major, hugely coffee-centric city and I cannot find a convenient place to buy them locally. Online ordering is my only option right now.|Capsule Tasting Notes|A starter variety pack of capsules comes with the Circolo. I also ordered a box of decaffeinated Lungo capsules from the Dolce Gusto website, using a coupon that came with the machine.I've graded each type of capsule on a A (best)-B-C-D-F (worst) scale.ESPRESSO: B+*caramelized flavor, thin crema, aroma OK not great, starts slightly bitter with pleasant finish and aftertasteAMERICANO: F or C*F: weak, over extracted, no flavor, poor aroma (suggested water amount)*C: barely acceptable flavor, similar to cheap diner coffee (half suggested water amount)DECAF LUNGO: D or C or B*D: very little flavor (suggested water amount)*C: slightly bitter (half suggested water amount)*B: strong, full flavor, slightly reminiscent of instant coffee (minimum water amount allowed by machine)CAPPUCCINO: C*slightly sweet, neutral aroma, mouth feel of full fat whole milk, more like a caffè latte, lots of milk with a touch of coffee (8 oz total volume from 6 oz. milk & 2 oz. coffee)LATTE MACCHIATO: B*foamy, milky, sweet, faint coffee flavorLUNGO: C*slight coffee flavor, like an espresso bar Americano with lots of waterCHOCOCINO: A*rich, foamy, strong chocolate flavor, nicely balanced between milk and chocolate|The Bottom Line|For my tastes, the Circolo makes an acceptable espresso shot and a fine hot chocolate. The other drinks are just OK at best and aren't satisfying.And while it's possible to make passable decaf coffee by severely cutting back on the water used, the resulting yield from each capsule is extremely small. It will get expensive really quickly making full mugs of coffee this way.So if you're somebody who has similar coffee habits to mine, the Circolo is limited to use as an espresso and hot cocoa maker. When coupled with the small selection and restricted availability of coffee capsules, the Dolce Gusto system is unlikely to get heavy use in my kitchen.

"I'm using the Belkin MIXIT 30-pin ChargeSync Cable with a 4th generation iPod Touch. I have the blue colored version. The cable works as it should for both charging and syncing.Build quality is fine. A nice feature is a raised tab on the 30-pin connector that makes it easier to grasp when inserting or removing it from a device. I also like the pleasant blue color of the cable itself--now that I have both Lightning and 30-pin devices, it's easier to grab the right cable with just a brief glance.

"If you are trying to break away from the subdued, but aren't yet ready for full-on bling, this may be the watch for you. It's large, rose tone gold colored, and has faux diamonds surrounding the watch face--it is not for the faint of heart. After you get over the shock of the mere idea of faux diamonds and commit to wearing the watch for a few days, however, you realize that the faux diamonds actually blend into the design as a whole quite well. If you aren't used to wearing large watches, you can think of it as a functional piece of costume jewelry rather than as a day-to-day watch.While I do intend to wear the watch when I don't want to wear a bracelet but still want to add a little pop to my look, I do have two reservations that will likely prevent me from making this my everyday watch. Not surprisingly given its size, the watch is rather heavy, so much so that you really can't forget you're wearing it. Also, if your wrist is bony, you may find that the dial digs in to your wrist.The manual (or lack thereof) is another source of complaint. A booklet does come with the watch, and while it describes some ancillary features such as the degree to which the watch is waterproof, it misses critical points. The watch has three inset dials; however, there is no information on the purpose of these dials or on how to reset them if needed. The insert also does not address how to resize the watchband. I took it to a watch shop to have it resized, but if I had wanted to do it myself, I would have been on my own.Overall, this watch is a nice addition to my wardrobe, but due to its weight and size, it is not likely to become my everyday watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3REP6175MYF93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CA0EJL4#wasThisHelpful","R3REP6175MYF93","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first laid eyes on the House of Marley Liberate BT sound system, I was impressed. It's a nice looking wireless speaker that fits well into pretty much any environment, including offices (no, it's not shaped like a giant spliff or sporting Jamaican flag colors!). So I was excited to pair it with my iPod Touch.Unfortunately, there are some important things I've discovered I don't like. First, the Liberate only puts out decent sound at low to moderate volume levels. Once you start cranking up the power, the midrange becomes really prominent and everything sounds muddy and blaring. A related problem is that whenever the Liberate is first turned on, the volume resets to a high level. It does not remember any previous settings.Another thing I don't like is that there is no way to replace the battery. The Liberate's enclosure is completely sealed up, except for a mini-USB port and a 3.5mm plug jack. When the battery no longer is rechargeable, you'll either have to keep the Liberate connected to a power source all the time, losing the portability, or get rid of the entire system. That's a big waste, especially since Marley does not seem to provide any way to recycle or otherwise properly dispose of the Liberate. If you listen to music for several hours each day, it would be easy to put the battery through a few hundred charge cycles and  wear it out in about a year. That's not a very long lifespan.Bottom line: if you only occasionally listen to music at work and don't want the ability to make things loud, the Liberate could be a good choice. However, the inaccessible battery and mediocre sound quality at higher volumes limit the Liberate's usefulness for me.-------NoteOn my iPod I mostly listen to rock and jazz in MP3 and AAC formats. I tested both wireless and wired connections between the iPod and the Liberate. I had no problems getting either type of connection to work. I also tried out all the sound equalization options offered in the iPod's Settings menu in an effort to get better sound from the Liberate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFI5ZSWXEL1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC27UF8#wasThisHelpful","R2QFI5ZSWXEL1C","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This iPhone 5c case has a major design flaw: the sides are slippery! Even with a super-protective, shock absorbing case (which this case is not), it's never good to drop your phone. The slick and glossy edges on this thing make it all too easy for your phone to slip out of your hand.The case is quite light and fits well, though. If you are extremely careful with your phone and are mainly looking to protect the back from scratches with a bit of (depending on your personal style, choose one) Kardashian-style bling or 1950's Formica sparkle, it might be OK. But I think most people will do better with a case that has grippier sides.Two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375UPVZT2NO7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMPXK4W#wasThisHelpful","R375UPVZT2NO7H","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After receiving the MarBlue Slim case several weeks ago, it has become my official go-to case. The easy snap on, snap off design makes the case ideal if you want protection on the go, but prefer to use your device without a case at home.  The device fits snugly, which is a plus if you carry your Kindle in your bag and might otherwise worry about it falling out and being damaged, but at the same time, it doesn’t share the downside of some cases you feel you need to pry rather than pop out of the case.The kickstand design is also an advantage of this case. I am able to prop up the case at the angle that best suits my needs in any situation without bothering about the Kindle sliding down the rubberized stand. The inability to prop up the device both horizontally and vertically is the only significant downside I have experienced with this case.Overall, a winner for those interested in design flexibility without adding significant weight or size to your device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSO611PXDA3TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZNOVS#wasThisHelpful","RSO611PXDA3TU","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Icebreaker has made a great mid or light-duty outer layer here. Merino wool with a soft, fuzzy finish inside is a lot nicer to wear than polyester fleece. And it's machine washable to boot!There are some things to keep in mind though:1. Icebreaker cuts its clothing slim. If you are unsure about which size to get, it's probably best to size up.2. However, the current version of the Sierra doesn't fit as narrowly as in previous seasons. It's looser all over. No, Icebreaker hasn't suddenly become a ""Big and Tall"" brand but its pieces are now more forgiving for people who aren't built like marathoners.3. For some reason Icebreaker uses left-handed main zippers on all its products, not just its women's line. In other words, men's items have the zipper pull on the left side. This is the opposite of the standard practice in the US and takes a little while to get used to.Overall, the Sierra Full Zip is a comfortable, well-made jacket. It's fine for any use where you're not counting ounces and aren't that concerned about how quickly the piece dries. And if you already have a Sierra in one of the solid colors, have a look at the Break-Up Infinity style. It has a state-of-the-art camouflage pattern, licensed from Mossy Oak. I got it because it reminds me of the hunting themed lining of a rectangular Coleman sleeping bag I had as a kid.

"Have you ever worn your Patagonia R1 fleece layers around town (since R1/Polartec PowerDry fleece really is the best available) but felt a bit sheepish (ha ha) because you looked like you were getting ready to camp out for a month or strap on a climbing harness?Well, the Upslope jacket is a nicely tamed version of Patagonia's highly technical R1 Full-Zip jacket. The Upslope, while not a baggy garment by any means, has a more generous, forgiving cut. The cuffs, collar, and waist are made from a knit, ribbed material that is stretchy and gives the Upslope a more tailored look than a Full-Zip. Best of all, the Upslope is great for layering because the R1 fleece has a smooth and shiny finish. Shells and overcoats glide right over it.I think the Upslope is best for in-town and soft-adventure travel wear. It is a bit heavy compared to more technical fleeces, such as Patagonia's R1 and R2 lines and the Marmot Alpinist Tech Jacket, doesn't have ultra flat pocket and zipper construction, and the zipper pulls are bits of knotted rope without rubber grasps. As I said before, this thing wants to be *civilized*! But you still get high performance and comfort that blows away those big-box store and fast fashion chain cheap-o fleeces.All in all, a cozy, warm jacket that fits into daily living well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJ2X4NSZONYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8C98ZS#wasThisHelpful","RJJ2X4NSZONYS","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own lots of Bugsaway stuff--shirts, hats, socks, neckerchiefs, you name it! When the permethrin fabric treatment (Insect Shield) is near its peak strength, the insect repellent function of Bugsaway clothing works quite well. I've worn Bugsaway in both dry and humid areas and I recommend the line to anybody who wants to reduce the amount of DEET they put on their skin.The downside of Insect Shield is that it eventually washes out of fabrics. Early generations of Insect Shield were rated for only 25-30 wash cycles, while the current version is rated for 70 washes. If you're travelling fast and light and only carrying a couple of shirts, it's pretty obvious that the constant washing will get you to 70 washes quickly...especially if you're on a multi-week trip or getting heated up and sweaty a lot.So, I was instantly interested in the Sandfly jacket when I came across it recently. An outer layer does not have to be washed nearly as often as a shirt. Plus a jacket offers more flexibility if you're in an area where you don't need constant insect protection. My only worry was that the Sandfly might be too heavy or bulky to wear in hot conditions.The Sandfly, I was pleased to discover, is very well suited to wearing a thin, wicking base layer underneath because the majority of the jacket is made out of mesh. It is extremely light weight, breathable, and compressible. It has a slimmer cut than many ExOfficio garments, but still fits more generously than Patagonia's slim fit or anything made by Icebreaker. It may be more accurate to call the Sandfly an overshirt rather than a jacket; it has no insulation and offers no protection from cold or wet.ExOfficio could improve a few minor things, though. First, the chest pocket doubles as a stuff sack for the jacket but there isn't any kind of attachment point (like a fabric loop) to use when the jacket is packed and stuffed into the pocket. This means you can't tie it to a pack or clip it on your belt. Second, the chest pocket's inner zipper slider doesn't come with a zipper pull. Finally, the main zipper is a thin coil zipper that is quite stiff and a little difficult to get started. Slightly larger teeth and a larger slider would make the jacket easier to open and close quickly. None of these are showstoppers in any case.Bottom line: I wish the Sandfly had been around years ago. Then I wouldn't be the owner of several Bugsaway shirts that are near the end of their insect repellent lifespan but aren't that suitable for around-town wear.

"What's the deal with all the open-world sandbox games with ""dogs"" in the title lately? Sleeping Dogs, Watch Dogs, what's gonna be next? Eating Dogs, Walking Dogs, Lap Dogs, Hot Dogs?Anyway, Watch Dogs is fun if you like sandbox games. Don't look for a lot of innovative gameplay or a radically new take on the genre. With the exception of invasive multi-player (more about that below), it's a mashup of a lot of stuff that has come before it.In video game math, we can say:Watch Dogs = Grand Theft Auto + Deus Ex + Max Payne(free roaming, multiple ways to beat missions, a super slo-mo powerup, lots of guns)Watch Dogs = Grand Theft Auto + Heavy Rain + Lisbeth Salander + Edward Snowden(gang warfare, a dark, disturbing, voyeuristic tone, hacking, conspiracies, NSA-type surveillance)Watch Dogs = Grand Theft Auto + Clockwork Orange + the Untouchables(carjacking, ultraviolence, Chicago)So if any of that turns your head, you'll probably dig Watch Dogs. Or if experiencing a deviant dystopia that is influenced by Orwell, Kafka, and Gaitskill sounds cool, you'll like Watch Dogs.The feature that seems to have received the most hype is the persistent and invasive multi-player. You don't have to launch a special multi-player mode to have other, REAL people enter into your game. Unless you're involved in a mission, another player can try to hack you or tail you at any time. I've never been big into multi-player gaming so I can't say this makes or breaks Watch Dogs for me...but I do think it's an interesting way to keep the game constantly changing and challenging for everybody. The online car racing, on the other hand, is exactly like it is in other driving games. As usual, knowing the courses and their shortcuts thoroughly is the key to succeeding.Ubisoft could have done a few things better. First, the load times are atrocious on PlayStation3. Every time you die or fail a mission, it's a long wait for the game to reset itself. This takes you out of the game and breaks up the flow. The only game that was worse for this is Stuntman. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the same studio, Reflections, was involved in developing both games! Second, again possibly related to Reflections, driving is kind of a pain. Pretty much every vehicle is hard to control because of floaty, super squirrely, or unresponsive handling. Finally, the story and character development doesn't rise above typical videogame level. While the writing in Watch Dogs is no better or worse than in most games, Ubisoft could have taken more care with such a highly promoted, Triple-A release. None of these are showstoppers, though.Bottom line: Watch Dogs is a fun and, thanks to current events, highly topical game. It might make you paranoid as well. Four stars.----------Oh yeah, if you've ever had a hankering to hang out with Al Jourgensen or see the Survival Research Laboratories (SRL) workshops there are a few things in the game that will make you laugh.

"My household is chock full o' Timbuk2 stuff. Messenger bags, totes, camera inserts, mobile phone pouches, and more. While we all appreciate Timbuk2's burly construction and lifetime warranty on its products, pretty much every item has something that could have been done better. Usually it's a small detail, such as Velcro hooks on a flap facing towards clothing (better to have the pile side that way to avoid knit fabrics getting caught up) but sometimes it's a major problem like a rucksack that won't close properly unless it's fully loaded.This time it's different, as the saying goes. The Command Laptop Backpack has been thoughtfully designed all the way through. It is truly a joy to wear and use. Every pocket, slot, buckle, and strap has been well thought out and elegantly blends form and function.I have the Carbon Full-Cycle Twill color/fabric choice. This grey colored woven fabric gives the Command a soft, pleasant hand with a professional looking texture. And grey, of course, is a color that works well in pretty much all office, school, and travel situations. Overall, the Command has a nicely understated and minimalist look to it.The most amazing thing about the design to my mind is that even though the Command is a 32-liter volume pack, it looks and feels like a much smaller pack. When it's not fully loaded and the bottom compression straps are pulled in, it feels, in both size and weight, almost like carrying a 20-liter daypack. Very nice. The other great feature is the TSA-compliant laptop compartment. When you're at an airport security checkpoint, all you have to do is flip the shoulder straps over to the front of the pack and open a zippered flap to expose your computer to TSA screeners. Helpfully, the straps are anchored to the top of the bag such that they lie flat and stay put no matter which way they're facing. There's even a handle on the long edge of the pack that allows you to carry the bag like a briefcase when the shoulder straps have been rotated. Again, very nice.Do keep two things in mind, though. First, while the suspension is very comfortable and highly adjustable, the Command isn't suitable for outdoor activity use because it doesn't have a waist strap. Second, anybody who is hard on bags might want to look at one of the nylon fabric color options. The Full-Cycle Twill will not stand up to abrasion, moisture, and abuse as well as the regular nylon fabric.Bottom line: five stars, for an incredibly well designed and constructed technology backpack.----------AddendumTimbuk2 takes its warranty program seriously. I recently sent them a pack with fabric and stitching that was beginning to tear. They repaired my bag and returned it to me at no charge, even though I had been using the bag for over a year. That's unbeatable service!Addendum 2The laptop compartment really isn't a hassle to access quickly. As I said above, the shoulder straps easily rotate out of the way when necessary, lie flat, and don't require unhooking or removing any straps or buckles to flip them over. I've posted some photos in the Customer Images area to show how it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8DLAICPBG1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSGFTPU#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8DLAICPBG1G","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a travel case for your Kindle Fire HDX 7"", consider the Incipio zipper case. It's especially well-suited for business travel, with a professional looking folio design and a smooth, leather-like finish.The case offers sturdy construction that should protect your Kindle even when you put it in soft luggage stuffed under your seat. It's hard to imagine using the credit card holders, but the penholder comes in handy for carrying a stylus. Once you arrive at your destination, it's easy to snap your Kindle out of the case. The back and sides of your device remain protected by a thin, light plastic cover that's designed to allow quick removal and reattachment. The button covers are well placed, allowing you to use your Kindle without removing the case for use during your flight.Overall, the case has served me well on a couple of work trips and I intend to use it in the future when I travel. There are, however, a couple of downsides to the case. First, the zipper is a little stiff. The main shortcoming, though, is the lack of a kickstand. iI you watch movies on your flight or later at your hotel you will be limited to holding your Kindle by hand. If it were equipped with a kickstand, I would be likely to leave my Kindle in this case even when I'm not traveling, but without that feature, I find myself switching between cases. Luckily, the hard back snaps off easily, so if your at-home case is easy to attach, this shouldn't be a major issue.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJ58NAJEJHT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZOIOU#wasThisHelpful","R2TJ58NAJEJHT2","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know what you're thinking. I'll pick up the FastFit Keyboard case for my iPad Mini and I can stop lugging my laptop around. Less weight, less space, no more trying to type on a virtual keyboard, everybody's happy, right?Well, it doesn't quite work out that way. The compact size of the iPad Mini has forced Belkin to make several design decisions that reduce the usability of the FastFit keyboard. The keys are small so it's easy to make ""fat finger"" mistakes even if you have slender hands. A lot of the keys have three functions. Some of the keys deviate from the standard QWERTY configuration. For touch-typists in particular, it is very jarring to have an Enter key where the semicolon/colon key is usually located.Aside from the physical layout of the keyboard, the FastFit does have many positive aspects. It is very lightweight, has an aluminum back that exactly matches Apple's iPad shell, and acts as a stand as well as a screen cover. It also supports the iPad's close-cover-to-sleep function, although that's not that useful when you're using the keyboard as a stand.Something Belkin should improve is to either provide more comprehensive setup and usage instructions in the box or post detailed information on its website. The printed sheet that comes with the keyboard is very minimal and leaves users to discover a lot of things on their own. Belkin's website currently isn't much help either, even in the Support section.Bottom line: the FastFit Keyboard is an improvement over the iPad's on-screen keyboard. However, I think hunt-and-peck typists benefit more from the FastFit because its physical design limitations make it difficult for touch-typists to work quickly and accurately. I do like the overall construction and features of the FastFit though; the problem is that the iPad Mini just isn't well suited for this type of accessory. 3.5 stars, then, rounded up to 4 because the FastFit's weaknesses are rooted in Apple's design, not Belkin's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8U8D0YF8DI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ED4N8WQ#wasThisHelpful","R1L8U8D0YF8DI2","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Circulon Genesis series is a lightweight line of pots and pans that is well made and has a nonstick coating that is safe to use with metal utensils. These two features alone put this Genesis set ahead of most value priced sets. However, the light and thin aluminum construction means that accomplished home cooks or those who can afford the increased initial cost might want to look at higher-end cookware.I do think, though, Circulon Genesis is nicely suited for uses such as:*A quick start for college students moving off campus*In a vacation house that is rented out*For people who don't cook often or mainly boil liquids and heat up prepared products*Anybody who wants robustly made, non-stick cookware that doesn't cost a lot, with the tradeoff of middling heat absorption and retention performanceCooking with the Genesis set is as expected. Each piece heats up and cools down very quickly. That's OK for dishes that are cooked hot-and-fast in a single step, such as fried eggs, but not ideal for searing thick cuts of meat or for anything that goes low 'n' slow, like braises. Also, the distribution of heat across each pan depends heavily on the shape and size of the stove burner you're using, due to the thinness of the metal.Bottom line: since Circulon offers a lifetime warranty on its products, durability concerns raised by the light materials aren't a big factor. So within the uses discussed above, I feel comfortable giving this set four stars. Committed cooks and those who can afford to spend more will, I believe, be happier by stepping up to a ""better"" or ""best"" product line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DR91MZT2VTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP3WEVE#wasThisHelpful","R28DR91MZT2VTR","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My reviewing perspective*I'm using the Shure SE112 Earphones with a 4th generation iPod Touch and an iPad Mini that are loaded with music in MP3 and AAC formats.*On my iDevices I mostly listen to rock and jazz. I don't like to hear a lot of bottom end, especially over headphones and earbuds.*I'm not an especially demanding mobile listener because when I want to hear great sound or listen to classical music, I rely on my home stereo (yes, that's incredibly old school, I know).What I like*These earphones generate good sound. The high end, midrange, and low end are well balanced and clear, to my ears.*The ear tips help ensure a good seal for blocking outside noise. Three sets of tips are included: large, medium, and small.*The combination of a light weight and the soft tips make the SE112s very comfortable to wear for long periods.*The Left and Right markings on the buds are large and easy to read.*A velvet carrying pouch and cleaning tool are provided.There is something important to keep in mind, though. As with anything that tightly seals up the ear canal, any movement in the earphones or cord translates into a distracting noise. Loud, busy songs can mask the movement sounds but they can be heard over most music.Bottom line: The Shure SE112 Earphones are a fine way to listen to music. The big caveat, in my opinion, is that the movement noise makes these earphones unsuitable for workout or any other use that makes the cord swing around.  If you can keep the cord still, though, the SE112s are a good replacement for cheap, stock earbuds.

"The Contigo Tranquil Bottle has a great feature not commonly found on water bottles: a two-piece cap that allows you to choose between a wide mouth and a narrow mouth. I really like the ability to use the wide opening when filling and cleaning the bottle and the narrow opening when taking a drink.However, I don't think the Tranquil is a good choice for serious outdoors use (trekking, camping, climbing, skiing, etc.) because the cap is not self-attached to the bottle and, according to Contigo's website, the bottle cannot be used with hot liquids. But for times when losing hold of the cap would not be catastrophic and you don't care about not being able to pour boiling water or a stew or soup into the bottle, the Tranquil is a very functional, well-designed water bottle.Four stars, keeping the Tranquil's limitations in mind.----------NoteSee the comments section of this review for a link to Contigo's instruction sheet for the Tranquil.

"I've been using the Samsung 16GB microSDHC UHS-I memory card to transfer files between an i7 iMac, a HP Slate 7 Extreme tablet, and a first-generation (""fat"") PS3, using the built-in card readers.I have not had any problems with data-transfer rates or writing and deleting files.  However, it is a little disappointing that Samsung did not include a card case. All you get is the micro-card and an adapter for using the card in SD-sized slots. This is just a quibble, though, and only is an issue if you plan on carrying the card outside of a device (say, in a camera bag).Four stars, keeping in mind that I am not making the kind of performance demands a DSLR camera or streaming video box would put on the card.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336MHRMOQ09EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVPU7KE#wasThisHelpful","R336MHRMOQ09EU","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hive Response case offers the standard features you'd expect in a Kindle Fire case, including a stand to prop up the device for movie watching or surfing, but with the added benefit of an eye-catching design. I'm not sure the honeycomb design offers the ergonomic benefits cited in the product description, but the hive design together with the soft blue color make this one of the most visually appealing cases on the market.The case slips on easily and fits snugly once in place, offering solid protection without the annoyance that sometimes comes with inserting or removing a device from its case. The case does not include a screen protector or front panel, so if you tend to be rough on your devices, you may want to consider another option. That said, the relatively thick rubber inner case along with the plastic hard shell should offer all the protection you'll need.I only have one suggestion for improvement. While the horizontal kickstand works well for watching movies, having a vertical kickstand option would make it easier to read hands free. The ease with which you can add and remove the outer shell would make this the ideal solution for those looking for a protective, but not necessarily super-rugged case.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3285XLUQ6U0SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZPF9M#wasThisHelpful","R3285XLUQ6U0SR","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The 2013 redesign of the R1 Pullover made it the best midlayer fleece for active use today. It goes well beyond everything else currently available in both form and function.Patagonia shifted from a single fabric design to a zonal, dual fabric construction. The main body of the pullover uses a fleece that is very light weight and compressible yet warm, while areas that often get damp (underarms, underarm gussets, collar, cuffs) use an even lighter and faster drying fleece. Both fabrics have a smooth, shiny finish to make layering over the garment easier.The key to the high performance of the fleece fabrics is how they are made. Small squares of fleece are woven in a grid pattern on the inner face of a stretchy, translucent backing. This gives the fabrics the ability to be both warm and breathable. The fleece squares hold warm air while the thin backing allows moisture and vapor to pass between each square, unimpeded. Much better than earlier generation fleece!Other details which set the R1 apart are thumbholes on the sleeves, cuffs that stay put when pushed up, an extra long main zipper that makes it easy to dump lots of heat quickly, and a chest pocket that doubles as a second heat vent.My only caveats are that the cut and fit are fairly slim since the R1 needs to fit under a shell or other outer layer and, yes, it costs a lot more than those boxy, heavy el-cheapo fleeces that are a common sight at discount and fast-fashion stores. But if you want your fleece to be more than just a glorified baby's blanket, the R1 Pullover is well worth its price. And let's face it, if you don't lead a reasonably active lifestyle, you don't need this kind of technical garment.Five stars.----------Note:At the time of the writing of this review, the seller's product descriptions are for the R1 Hoody, NOT the R1 Pullover. The main differences between the two are that the Pullover does NOT have a hood (!) and the main zipper is not offset. Also, potential purchasers may want to ask the seller if the product being offered is the Fall 2013 or Spring 2014 model of the R1 Pullover. The pre-2013 versions, in my opinion, are not as well-designed as the later ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UX18SEVJNWEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UM25PI#wasThisHelpful","R2UX18SEVJNWEP","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let's answer the big question: does NeoShell really do what Polartec says it does? Based on my experience with the Nabu jacket, the answer is yes...at least as long as the durable water repellant (DWR) finish on the outer fabric is working well. As anybody who already has waterproof-breathable rainwear knows, keeping the DWR in good condition is just as important as the membrane material when it comes to real-life breathability.The Nabu, then, offers something that didn't really exist before: a mix of hardshell waterproofness and softshell comfort and breathability. Before NeoShell, the closest thing to the Nabu was hybrid jackets that put hardshell panels in critical areas and used softshell fabric everywhere else. These garments, unfortunately, were a compromise and in actual use never really lived up to their promise.I find the Nabu to be a very comfortable and functional jacket. It is soft and stretchy, like softshells should be, stays quiet when you're in motion, has a flexible, lightweight lining, and is cut slightly long in the sleeves and hem to give lots of freedom of movement. I've worn it in some pretty heavy downpours, both with and without a pack on, and did not experience any leaks or discomfort. The Nabu is not that great for going fast and light, however, because it is somewhat heavy and not very compressible. Also, the breathability works so well that the Nabu may not be the best choice for extremely windy or cold conditions.A few small improvements Marmot could make would be to give the hood a wire reinforced brim (at this price point the laminated brim seems a little chintzy), make the Velcro wrist adjusters wider and longer, and change the design of the pleated gussets on the sleeves so that gathered fabric from adjusting the cuffs lies more flat. I don't think any of these are showstoppers, though.So, if you're tired of the crispy and stiff feeling of hardshells and aren't worried about the usual weaknesses of softshells (heavy, low abrasion resistance, not windproof, bulky), the Nabu is a great way to get waterproof-breathable performance more comfortably. Do keep in mind that if you already own a softshell, buying an ultralight hardshell, such as the Patagonia M10 or Marmot Super Mica, may be a better way to go, especially if you are counting ounces. You'll gain more layering flexibility and benefit from a having more robust outer layer in the rain. Travellers, on the other hand, should find the Nabu to be extremely useful and I think it will quickly become a favorite.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFS6CQV7YRM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFR7PKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TFS6CQV7YRM8","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the Northwall, even though it's not really an essential piece. In other words, if you don't already own a hardshell, an uninsulated softshell, and a fleece midlayer, buy those three items first. They will form the core of your gear kit and provide maximum layering flexibility. The Northwall, on the other hand, is great for times when you KNOW you wouldn't want to take off your fleece, aren't expecting really wet conditions, and don't want to wear two separate garments. Plus all of Patagonia's state-of-the-art technical features are present: welded seams, a unique drawcord system for adjusting the hood and waist, and the best fleece available today.It's important to realize that Patagonia gave the Northwall a minimalist design intended for active outdoors use. It is water resistant, not waterproof, does not have hand warmer or internal pockets, has a rather snug fit, and is cut long in the sleeves and back hem. Anybody who is looking at the Northwall for around-town wear only might end up disappointed because it is not particularly warm when you're not moving and doesn't have a lot of room for carrying stuff.But if you like the extremely light yet highly functional softshell material used in Patagonia's Knifeblade series (Polartec Power Shield Pro) and also like R2 fleece (the middle weight of Patagonia's technical fleeces), the Northwall is a fine way to get the best of both in one jacket.Four stars, keeping in mind the Northwall is best as an addition to your core gear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38DI56LNDZE56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GW4QGNS#wasThisHelpful","R38DI56LNDZE56","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Rapid because I wanted a bag that was truly waterproof and also usable as a comfortable hiking daypack. During my search, I narrowed my choices to two packs: the Rapid and the Patagonia Stormfront Rolltop Pack 30L.The major differences are:*The Rapid is sewn together, with sealed seams, while the Stormfront has welded seams.*Both packs have a similar strap and suspension design that utilizes an external, permanently attached framesheet to provide structure and stiffness, but the Rapid's framesheet is full length. The Stormfront's framesheet has a mid-back gap.*The Stormfront is made with a denser, stiffer material than the Rapid (800 denier nylon with waterproof coating on both sides of the fabric vs. 420 denier nylon with a waterproof liner laminated to the inner face)While both packs are about the same price, I went with the Rapid because it has many hiker-friendly features, such as exterior mesh pockets, hydration bladder support, and a Hypalon lash loop, and its flexible fabric is more comfortable for all-day walking. I wish the Rapid had welded seams since sewn and sealed seams are not as robust as those that are welded, but Sea to Summit has a lifetime guarantee so (hopefully) I'll be covered if any of the seams begin to leak. I also wish that the bottom of the pack was made from a higher denier material or had a double layer of fabric for durability in a part of the pack that receives a lot of abuse.Overall, the Rapid has performed well for me. I've worn it in heavy downpours and everything I had in the pack stayed completely dry. The shoulder straps do absorb some water, though, and require a few hours to fully dry out. The suspension is easy to adjust and comparable to those on alpine packs, with the exception of the sternum strap, which goes into slots and only has four possible positions, and the waist strap, which is a bit minimalistic for a 26L bag. Also, the rolltop works best when the pack is at least half full. When the pack is empty or only has a few items inside, the folds of the rolltop can loosen up slightly after closing the pack.Bottom line: the Rapid combines comfort with performance well. No more messing around with raincovers and trash bags when doing stuff in the wet!

The feel is very similar to the sort of giveaway ballpoint pens found in hotel rooms and not-so-fine dining establishments.While using a stylus is more precise than using your fingers on a touchscreen, something to keep in mind with this particular stylus is that it works best when held perpendicular to the screen.

"I like the Kensington BlackBelt 1st Degree Rugged Case for the iPad Air because it is very comfortable to hold and carry. Instead of using hard and unyielding plastic as the main material, Kensington made the BlackBelt out of a flexible, rubbery material. The BlackBelt, as a result, feels both grippy and soft in your hand.Don't worry--your iPad is still well protected. The case is very shock absorbent and has a beveled edge surrounding the screen, so that you can set your iPad face down without worrying, and thicker padding in the corners for additional impact protection.There are two things to keep in mind, though. First, the BlackBelt does not have any kind of membrane, covering, or lid for direct screen protection. Second, the BlackBelt has a two-piece design, with a transparent hard plastic insert that goes between the back of your iPad and the interior of the case. If you don't want your iPad's screen to be exposed at all times or if you like to switch cases often and you're a forgetful person, you may want to consider a different case.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R345925R4O91CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7BZI48#wasThisHelpful","R345925R4O91CQ","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Spy Among Friends is both a unique and thought provoking read.Unique because unlike many books about spies and spying, A Spy Among Friends is focused on the interpersonal facets of intelligence work. There is little discussion of spycraft or operational details. Instead, Ben Macintyre explores the psyches of three men whose careers and lives were mightily intertwined: Kim Philby, Nicholas Elliott, another elite member of MI6, and James Angleton, the legendary CIA officer. All three, over a period from the Second World War through the Cold War, were simultaneously helping each other and betraying one another. The consequences of their actions are well known; from Guy Burgess' defection to the USSR right before British intelligence was going to arrest him to the destruction of files to cover up the CIA's enabling role in Philby's activities, these three men were at the center of it all. Juggling and obfuscating professional ambition, personal life, and ideology was unavoidable and inescapable for them. Nobody, not even their own families and closest friends, knew the complete picture.Thought provoking because the Kim Philby case is simultaneously archaic and immediately relevant in today's world. The resurgence of tension and competition between Russia, the major European Union countries, and the United States is bringing back many of the political, economic, and human rights conflicts that arose during the Cold War era. It is a sure bet that the intelligence rivalry between ""East"" and ""West"" has intensified as well, with the new twist that low-level workers who are not social elites have the ability to do as much, if not more, intelligence damage to a country as Philby did. Present day informants such as Bradley/Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden would have found it extremely difficult or impossible in Philby's era to access the quantity and quality of documents they stole. Further, somebody like Snowden probably would not even have been allowed into the clubby and incestuous intelligence world of the 1940's, 50's, and 60's due to his lack of educational pedigree and social connections. These changes have significant implications for counterintelligence work that still have not been fully recognized, as shown by the failure of the NSA to contain or even perceive Snowden's activities until after he went public.Macintyre, in any case, is a fine writer, as readers of any of his previous books already know. He writes in a clean, clear, accessible style and has quite an eye for eccentric details of people and organizations. Macintyre liberally peppers his books with these drolleries and consequently keeps his narratives from becoming dry recitations of dates and historical facts.Bottom line: anybody with an interest in the Cold War, international relations, or the personal aspects of espionage should like this book.

"...you use the rear camera on your iPad Mini a lot.For the most part, the modulR iPad Mini Mobility Pack is a fine protective case with a nicely designed system of interchangeable components. The Pack contains a back plate that holds your iPad, a separate, shock absorbing front plate with raised posts at each corner for attaching accessories, and three carrying straps (shoulder, wrist, hand).A very odd design decision, though, makes the modulR case a poor choice for anybody who uses the rear camera frequently. In order to use your iPad, you have to snap the front plate over the rear of the back plate. The front plate does not have an opening for the camera. This means that when the case is open, the front plate blocks the camera. But when the case is closed, the camera lens is left unprotected because the back plate *does* have a camera opening.For non-Retina Mini owners, there is another problem: whenever the front plate is attached to the back plate, in any orientation, the microphone is covered up. The back plate does have a port that matches the placement of the rear panel mic on Retina Minis. But as above, the front plate will block both mic ports when a Retina iPad is in use.The only workaround for these problems is to carry the front plate separately when you want to use the camera or mic. Doing this, however, creates other problems because the front plate provides the shock protection and is where all the accessories attach. Plus it's a pain to keep track of yet another item when you're on the go.Bottom line: if you do not use your iPad regularly for photos, video, or Facetime, the modulR Mobility Pack works well. It is much lighter in weight, less bulky, and easier to put on and take off than most ""armored"" cases, such as OtterBox and Pelican, at the cost of providing less protection. The accessory attachment system adds a lot of flexibility to how you can carry and use your iPad. So, since I don't take pictures with my iPad much (I prefer a dedicated camera) and rarely use iPad Facetime or Siri (I do that stuff on my iPhone), I feel comfortable giving the Pack four stars. But constant users of the camera and/or microphone really should look at other cases. The same goes for anybody who needs truly robust impact and shock protection.----------AddendumI was also given a modulR Storage Stand, an accessory not included in the Mobility Pack, to review. The Stand attaches to the front plate posts and holds the iPad in landscape orientation (with the long edges horizontal). It has a hollow interior with cut-outs for storing a Lightning cable and an Apple 5W power adapter. It's functional and convenient for home or office use but I think it is too bulky to carry when commuting or travelling.Addendum 2modulR says this case meets ""Mil Shock Std 516.6"". This standard is a subsection of a broader United States Military standard, Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests (MIL-STD-810) and is essentially a drop test. It's worth noting that thicker and heavier cases such as the Pelican ProGear Vault, for example, are built to meet the same shock protection standard. However, manufacturers have a lot of leeway in carrying out the tests and there is no industry group or certification authority for consumer products making these claims.

Cellular and Wi-Fi reception do not seem to be affected by the case. Access to all buttons, ports, and switches is unimpeded.A design feature I particularly like is how Thule has made holding an iPhone more secure by beveling the top and bottom edges around the entire case and adding a non-slip finish to the areas where you naturally grip the iPhone.I do have a quibble that is a matter of personal taste. A large, reflective silver Thule logo is prominently placed right by the rear camera cutout. While this does not affect the functionality at all, I feel it makes the case a little obnoxious.  Whenever you're holding the phone to your ear or taking a photo, the logo screams to the world you have a THULE CASE on your phone! Of course, the sort of person who flaunts, say, a Tumi carry-on or an Arc'teryx jacket won't be bothered at all. To each her/his own taste, right?Aesthetics aside, I like the Atmos X3 very much overall and have made it the main case for my phone...I just wish the Thule branding was more restrained. Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MEEDZ2V35U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBIH1M8#wasThisHelpful","R3MEEDZ2V35U9","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought *this* would happen...Timbuk2 has, in effect, blown off the bike messenger gig, got a full-time job in an office and become kind of buttoned down. If you were good friends with an earlier version of the Classic Messenger, you might be wondering what's going on and if you'll be able to hang out with the new bag in the same way as before.Well, the Classic Messenger Bag 2014 is more or less the same on the inside as the previous Classic but has been scrubbed and cleaned up quite a bit on the outside. Now the squeeze clips are hidden away under the front flap, the main strap is softer and lighter, and the Timbuk2 logo patch has a more restrained look. Plus the new Cam buckle creates a sleeker, less-likely-to-get-caught-on-something profile by eliminating the gigantic loop of strap that used be created when the bag was hitched up high on your back.This new look seems a little odd at first since Timbuk2's style was fun and funky before. Crazy color combos, straps and reflectors hanging all over the place, and a cobbled together look was how Timbuk2 rolled before. But don't worry, the burly construction and comfortable feel have not changed. Things have just calmed down a bit and Timbuk2 is now set to move comfortably into middle age.So, if you're looking at your first messenger bag, Timbuk2 makes one of the best. They have a long history of quality workmanship and offer a lifetime warranty. If you're replacing a bag or adding to your collection, don't worry. The 2014 Classic may have become a bit boring on the surface but it's still a great messenger bag and won't let you down.----------AddendumTimbuk2 really does take its warranty program seriously. I recently sent them a bag with fabric and stitching that was beginning to tear. They are repairing my bag and returning it to me at no charge, even though I've been using the bag for over a year. Nice!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNX4IJK5INEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1O3WXI#wasThisHelpful","RCNX4IJK5INEI","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The FAVI Wireless Speaker for iPhone is interesting conceptually. It is a cradle that is able to amplify any sound generated by an iPhone without using a physical or Bluetooth connection. All you have to do is set your iPhone down on the Favi and it starts working. I tried it out with an iPhone 5c.Unfortunately, neither the wireless connection technology nor the cradle's amplifier and speaker are well suited for listening to music. Static and crackling is often introduced into the sound stream while the sound output quality itself is severely limited by a low-power amp and small speaker.Bottom line: for voice-only uses, such as conference calls, FaceTime, Siri, or non-musical audio and video streams, the Favi adds a bit of convenience if you're sitting at a desk or around a table. However, I view it as more of a toy than as a real aid to productivity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2X76GHGDBCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GY0UK8M#wasThisHelpful","R1A2X76GHGDBCS","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a hard shell case for your iPad Mini (I have a non-Retina Mini), the Pelican ProGear Vault has an almost perfect design. It is well built with rugged materials, can act as a stand, and every port, jack, and switch is protected when the case is closed up.So what's not to like? Well, there are a few small flaws that are not showstoppers but could have been easily avoided with some minor design decisions:*The opening for the Lightning port will only accept cable plugs that are the exact same size as those on Apple-made cables. This means you cannot use any cables with plugs that are even slightly larger than Apple's design, as cables made by accessory manufacturers often have. The opening is also very deep, which makes it difficult to insert and remove a cable without pushing or pulling on the cable itself, rather than on the plug end. This stresses the cable in an area that isn't meant to withstand much pressure, torque, or force.*While a metal hinge is used to connect the top and bottom of the case, the latch used to close the case is made of rigid plastic. It seems likely that repeated use of the latch over time will weaken or break it. Pelican does have a lifetime guarantee, though, so it may be possible to get a replacement case if the latch does fail.*There isn't a really comfortable way to hold the iPad in portrait orientation. The case latch protrudes backwards when the case is fully opened, making it somewhat awkward to hold on the right hand side.*The case hinge is not stiff enough to allow a full range of positions when the case is acting as a stand in landscape orientation. When the stand is opened to more than a 30-40 degree angle, depending on the surface it's resting on, the stand no longer supports the iPad.These are all minor things, though, and take little away from an extremely protective and functional case. I like the Vault and have been very satisfied with its performance overall. Four stars.----------AddendumFor anybody trying to decide between the Pelican Vault and the OtterBox Defender (I have both), the choice mainly comes down to three things.First, do you want your iPad's camera to be protected by the case? The Vault's camera port has a transparent cover while the port on the Defender is just a hole in the case.Second, does having an integrated screen membrane matter to you? The Defender has a sheet of clear plastic that covers the iPad's screen at all times. On the Vault, the screen is uncovered when the case is open.Finally, are you forgetful or klutzy? The Defender has a two-piece design with its lid doubling as a stand. The lid and case are not connected in any way, so there is a larger potential for mishaps than with the Vault, where the lid and case are connected by a hinge.In any event, the Vault and Defender are very similar to one another; each is a burly, strongly constructed case with lots of protective features. You won't go wrong buying either one.Addendum 2See the comments to this review for additional information about Military Specification MIL-STD-810G and IP ratings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNJ3WDLORP9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAXRVTG#wasThisHelpful","R2XNJ3WDLORP9B","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using the Belkin Dot Cover with a non-Retina iPad Mini. It is lightweight and provides basic protection to both the front and back of my iPad.Things I like:*Thin and light, with an easy-to-grip, soft matte finish.*The clasp is held in place magnetically both when the case is closed and when the case is used as a stand.*Easy to insert and remove iPad.*Understated, professional appearance.Overall, this a good case for undemanding environments, such as classrooms, offices, and cafes. Keep in mind, though, that it does not provide much shock protection and is not water resistant. It also does not automatically put the iPad to sleep when the cover is closed (an odd design decision). But if you appreciate minimalist design and are generally careful with your gadgets, the Dot Cover is a fine choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15UE6NAPF8TVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T0NM66#wasThisHelpful","R15UE6NAPF8TVF","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The OtterBox Clearly Protected screen cover does what it's supposed to: it provides scratch protection and makes it difficult to read the screen from certain angles.The big tradeoff, as you would expect, is that using the cover negates the benefits of having a Retina screen on your phone. Brightness, color intensity, and image clarity are all diminished by this cover, as with any privacy screen. It's like going back to the days when flat panel monitors and laptop screens had a vinyl anti-glare covering rather than a glossy, optically clear glass front.You can always crank up the screen's backlight to compensate for the cover's effect on brightness, of course, but then your phone's battery drains more quickly.In actual use, the effectiveness of the privacy function depends on what is being displayed on the screen and on an observer's viewing angle. Apps that use large typefaces or that have uncluttered designs, such as Apple's stock and weather apps, can still be read, even at a 45-degree angle from the phone. Busy, packed app interfaces are obscured pretty effectively, though, especially if they use a small or narrow font (the Bloomberg and BBC News apps are good examples of this).Bottom line: the Clearly Protected screen cover is simple to install and essentially does what it is designed to do, with some limitations. Even though I have stopped using it, I still think it is a four-star product because my issue is due to a personal preference--I like the sharpness and precision of Retina screens--and not to a design or manufacturing flaw.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSTEW0AYQFO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGVIYFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VSTEW0AYQFO0","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...a flawed design and sloppy sewing keep me from giving the Lowepro Passport Sling II four or five stars.I like the concept of the Passport Sling. It doesn't scream CAMERA BAG! and is lightweight and comfortable to carry.So what's my problem? It comes down to a few design decisions and workmanship. Specifically,*The bag's shape is asymmetric, with one end coming up a lot higher than the other. Consequently, accessing the part of the bag that hangs closest to your body is awkward.*Lowepro should use a strap buckle that closes more securely and that allows persistent adjustments to the shoulder strap length. Many messenger-style bags have a cam buckle that maintains the same high and low positions every time you use the bag. The buckle on the Passport comes open too easily and cannot ""store"" your preferred strap lengths.*A problem common to most sling and messenger bags is compounded by the buckle: it is difficult and uncomfortable to put things in or take things out of the bag when it is worn in a high position. Since the buckle and shoulder strap have to be readjusted every time the bag is raised or lowered, it is a major hassle to go in and out of the bag frequently.*I'm disappointed by the quality of the sewing and finishing on the Passport. The stitching on the padded insert's Velcro is fraying after only a few uses. There are needle holes in several places on the main zipper tape. Finally, I had to trim hanging threads all over the strap, bag, and insert before using it. I have a couple of other Lowepro camera bags and haven't encountered these issues before.Despite these dislikes, I have found a use for the bag. If I'm going to a place on public transport and I'll only need to take my camera out of the bag once during a shoot, the Passport works well. But I cannot recommend the Passport as a primary camera bag.Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO6MV8VWWWI6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GYIKHQ#wasThisHelpful","RO6MV8VWWWI6Y","A1BBYSMT9YCODI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BBYSMT9YCODI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Amazon's version of Apple's USB A to Lightning cable with a variety of Apple mobile devices, including iPhones and an iPad Mini, for both charging and syncing.It works without any problems or warnings from iOS. Amazon has built its cable somewhat differently than Apple, though. First, both the USB and Lightning plugs are longer, wider, and thicker than on Apple's cable. This may be an advantage for people who have difficulty grasping and pulling small objects or have mobility problems with their hands. Second, the cable itself is slightly thicker and heavier than Apple's. Finally, the finish on the Amazon cable is somewhat slippery to the touch while Apple cables have a rubbery finish.The only (inconsequential) problem with Amazon's cable is related to the Frustration Free packaging certification. While the cable is packed in a box that is easy to open, the plug ends come tightly wrapped in sticky plastic. Removing this plastic wasn't as easy as ""Frustration Free"" implies.Bottom line: the AmazonBasics Lightning cable is a seamless, value priced alternative to Apple cables, as long as you don't mind having the Amazon logo on both plug ends. And keep in mind this cable may not fit into device cases with a narrow or deep Lightning opening.

"“There once was a little girl who had boundless imagination, and exploring was one of her favorite things to do. Every object in the house that caught her eye had a brilliant story of its own…” – Daria SongAs a child, I loved coloring. I wouldn’t say that I was the most artistically gifted of children, but picking up crayons and a coloring book was so freeing. While I secretly maintained a stash of markers and coloring pages throughout high school (and even college), I was absolutely thrilled when adult coloring books became “a thing.” The variety of coloring books is diverse, and some are clearly better than others, but The Time Garden is an absolute treat. Daria Song manages to blend stunning coloring pages on high quality paper with a charming story. The book is bound in a quality way making this a book that can be added to your shelf after you have colored the pictures of the story. The cover has delicate gold accents, and the book jacket gives the book a formal feeling (but can be removed when coloring, making it a practical touch as well). The Time Garden is a one-of-a-kind book that is both a timeless coloring book and a precious story book.  While the images are dainty and require precision to be colored in the most beautiful fashion, the story can be enjoyed by all ages. This book is truly a gem!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJC28I8DBC09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607749602#wasThisHelpful","R2TJC28I8DBC09","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Facebook might know that you’re one of M&M’s many fans and send you offers accordingly. they also know when you break up with your boyfriend, move to Texas, begin appearing in lots of pictures with your ex, and start dating him again.

Christian Rudder of the website OkCupid analyzes data for his career, so it is not surprising that he successfully compiled an engaging book that makes numbers and graphs fascinating. The topics examined through data are diverse and somewhat eclectic, but completely engaging.

"This is definitely not my normal review and post.  This is not a novel or a non-fiction memoir, but a creative, individually-driven journal that is simply amazing.  The Q&A A Day series has journals for all types, college students, couples, kids, etc., but this newest one is designed for creatives of all ages. With a simple prompt and a 4-square layout, this journal allows your imagination to run wild each day. Thoughtful prompts encourage out-of-the-box thinking and allow you to feel focused and refreshed each day. Plus, the four year style allows you to see four years of thoughts, progress, and reflections in a simple format…it is like a time capsule in book form.Prompts vary with each day having a new spin on creative thinking, but some of my favorites follow: How would you illustrate a smell that you love? What would best symbolize your life’s biggest challenge right now? Visualize the pros and cons of a decision you need to make. What if you had to wear a disguise today? Picture it here. And If you could change one thing about yourself today, what would it be?The response options are unlimited.

"The premise of Crooked Little Lies sounded great...a mysterious series of events, a missing young man, a former prescription pill addict.  All of these could have come together to allow for a suspenseful and engaging story. Instead, I found the characters to be shallow, predictable, and petulant. There was a lot of complaining, unnecessary whining, and a lack of depth (to both the characters and the plot). Character relationships begin and end suddenly, and while there are hints of suspenseful underpinnings, in reality, these are never fleshed out in a way that allows them to be engaging plot twists.

"“Pope Francis insists on the dynamic element of the Church. In his homilies he is acting as a teacher of spiritual life, inciting us to move forward, to go to the existential peripheries, on mission. The way becomes the great metaphor of spiritual and ecclesiastical life. Only on the way is encounter possible. The way is, in this sense, the place of truth.” – Antonio SpadaroPope Francis has quickly become known for his approachable nature, his humility, and his relevant messages. His cheerful smile and undeniable warmth have made him a favorite among Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Encountering Truth captures these qualities in the most beautiful way with Pope Francis’ homilies from morning mass at Saint Martha’s chapel. Every morning, he observes mass with a devoted few; average people who are eager to join in the powerful celebration and gain inspiration from the pope. The simple homilies from these daily masses offer insight into Biblical passages as well as sound advice for those of us striving for faith in God in spite of the hectic pace of the modern world. Many of them have been collected in Encountering Truth so that devoted followers around the world can share in the wonders of the daily mass from a tiny Vatican chapel.Beginning with an engaging introduction by Antonio Spadaro, this book offers wisdom, insight, and most of all, reflections on scripture that are inspiring and comforting. With homilies focusing on grace, humility, courage, prayer, weakness, truth, and, hope, among others, this collection of 186 of Pope Francis’ brief homilies is an absolute gift. The brevity of each homily allows for a brief reading when there is time or a more in-depth study along with the provided Biblical passages. There is no need to rush through this book reading each homily; indeed, it is so much more beautiful when each passage is savored and fully appreciated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNBT30BL5WXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101903015#wasThisHelpful","R2UNBT30BL5WXH","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This keychain is adorable!  I had to purchase it when on vacation because it is so darn cute. The combination of coral leather and navy/cream linen make for an adorable little accessory that is both fun and functional. The leather is a bit stiff still (my keychain is relatively new), but it is made of high quality materials. The one thing that makes this keychain a bit off is that the flat central ring is very wide. As a result, not all keys will fit on the keychain. Yes, there is a hook so that you can add a second ring or clip keys on easily, but if your goal is to have a cute and simple ring of keys, you may miss the mark. I was able to fit my essential keys on this, but my car key can't move from the small center section where the ring is thinnest, and my mailbox key doesn't fit on at all.

So the challenge to find new ways to add texture, interest, and flavor to my food have meant using a new palate of ingredients and some new techniques in the kitchen.” – Anna JonesWith a title like A Modern Way to Eat, Anna Jones’ vegetarian cookbook makes a bold claim: the healthiest, most exciting, way to eat in the modern world is a plant-based diet filled with delicious, exciting recipes. Jones, best known as Jamie Oliver’s UK food stylist, has created a lovely collection of complex vegetarian recipes that are sure to please all crowds. The pictures are a beautiful combination of scenery and recipe options, and Jones’ voice and advice throughout the book make for a book that is as enjoyable to read as it is to rely on for recipes in the kitchen.Jones’ signature style is a slightly elevated take on classics. Some of these are celebrated with specific recipes, but others offer readers the opportunity to get creative with flow charts that make for perfect meals (i.e. the ideal dinner salad). There are some delicious options for all times of day: Blueberry Pie Oatmeal, Butternut Squash and Kale Tart, Favorite Roasted Roots, Sweet Tomato and Black Bean Tortilla Bowls, Asparagus and Toasted Cashew Stir Fry, and Roasted Banana and Coconut Ice Cream. The recipes range from classics (like Banana, Blueberry, and Pecan Pancakes) to exotic new options (Raw Thai Citrus Crunch Salad). While some of the recipes are labor intensive, and some require hard-to-find ingredients, they are worth the effort. Jones celebrates the vegetarian lifestyle, but does not fully address other dietary preferences. This book is ideal for experienced chefs eager to expand their repertoire of delicious vegetarian options, but probably not well-suited for beginning chefs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEK9LKOZYHTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607748037#wasThisHelpful","RHEK9LKOZYHTO","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This deodorant is wonderful. I didn't expect much because the last time I used a clear gel, it was less than effective.  I decided to give this a shot, though after receiving it from BzzAgent. I am so glad that I did. I brought it with me to D.C. and Michigan when I went on a recent vacation. The humidity was unbearable and it was hot the whole time I was on vacation. Using Secret Outlast, though, I didn't worry once about feeling fresh. This deodorant works and was perfect for every outfit (I had to be dressed for a wedding and several family get togethers and didn't worry a bit about marks on my dark clothing).

"“I love to eat. A lot. I often joke that my current way of living evolved from needing to find a way to eat a lot and still be healthy. Therefore the diet I follow and encourage others to is not about sacrifice, deprivation, or labels. It is about enjoying delicious food to the fullest extent without counting calories or fat grams. it is about adding healthy, whole-food ingredients to what you are already cooking, taking things slowly, and approaching food with an open mind and a curious belly.” – Sarah BrittonMy New Roots: Inspired Plant-Based Recipes for Every Season is completely unexpected. It is a beautiful collection of creative, healthy recipes with stunning photos, but it is also a guide to having fun with healthy food. Sarah Britton, of the My New Roots blog, knows how to make delicious food that is filling, beautiful, and energizing. Britton has ingeniously arranged recipes according to season (even dividing summer into early and late in order to maximize the fresh ingredients that compliment each other in each season).  Some of my favorite options include Raspberry Breeze Smoothie, Pear Apple Crumble, Thai-Style Coconut Soup with Zucchini Noodles, Butternut Stacks with Kale Pesto and Butter Beans, Cleansing Grape Salsa, Carmelized Fennel on Herbed Polenta, and Grilled Zucchini and Green Onions with Baby Spinach and Hazelnuts.  All of the recipes are vibrant and packed with freshness!There are a few things to know before diving in, though. While the title of her book states plant-based (a term that is typically associated with a vegan diet), Britton focuses on a diverse diet that does in fact have some dairy (i.e. the ghee is made of butter, yet Britton’s tag suggests that it is vegan and optional cheese in some recipes) and eggs in it. This can be a bit confusing (and even frustrating at times), but the recipes are diverse enough to be appealing to a wide range of eaters. There are some recipes that require some exotic ingredients that may not be available to all readers (celeriac, trumpet mushrooms, garlic scapes, etc.), and some of the recipes require a substantial amount of effort.  Overall, though, this book is an excellent guide to healthy living with delicious recipes!Pina Colada Passion Fruit Popsicles8 medium passion fruit3 cups chopped fresh pineapple1 (14 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk2 tablespoons raw honey or pure maple syrup1. Scoop out the flesh from the passion fruit into a small bowl and set it aside. You will have about 1 cup total fruit pulp.2. Combine the pineapple, coconut milk, and honey in a blender, and blend on high speed until smooth.3. Into each Popsicle mold, pour a small amount of either the pineapple-coconut blend or the passion fruit pulp, and then alternate between the two until you’ve almost reached the top (leave a small amount of space at the top to allow the liquid to expand slightly in the freezer). Using a Popsicle stick or skewer, stir the liquids a little bit to create a marble effect.4. Insert a Popsicle stick in each mold, and freeze until completely frozen, about 4 hours.5. To serve, run each mold under warm water until the Popsicle slides out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AEIE65AYLK1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804185387#wasThisHelpful","R2AEIE65AYLK1J","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“When a school principal explains that your girl has thrown ink in someone’s face, there are probably certain things that you’re not supposed to do. You’re not supposed to break down in tears, divulging your personal problems. You shouldn’t act like the mother of a criminal, angrily insisting, “She could not have done this!” And you probably shouldn’t get so defensive that you ask what the other student did to provoke her. But when it happened to me, all my shoulds went right out the window…Callie and I shared a seven-hundred-square-foot apartment. We shared meals and gossip and jokes, and after her latest growth spurt, we’d even started sharing shoes…”But Callie’s so gentle,” I , and then I started giving examples. Spiders behind the toilet, beetles inside the screen door, half-dead flies drowsing on the windowsill.  Callie scooped each of them up and shuffled to the front door, where she released their bodies in the open air…“It’s our policy to met with parents before taking disciplinary action,” Mrs. Jameson told me.And that was when she said it. Bully. Bullying.”  – Lauren FrankelBullying is a topic that cannot be ignored in contemporary society. Bullies come in all shapes and sizes, and bullying takes all forms. Hyacinth Girls deftly addresses the complexity of bullying and its evolving nature with technology. Rebecca, a single dental hygenist is raising her best friend’s daughter, thirteen-year-old Callie.  Callie is sweet, pretty, and popular, and when Rebecca is notified by the middle school principal that Callie was bullying a classmate, Robyn, she is horrified.  She realizes that there must be some mistake, and after talking with Callie and her two best friends, she realizes that the whole situation is a misunderstanding.  After meeting with the principal, Rebecca shares all of this, then is informed that other students came forward and cleared Callie’s name.  Rebecca is still shaken, though, when Robyn’s mother calls and accuses Callie of ruining her daughter’s life.As Rebecca tries to put the pieces together and move on, she watches Callie change. Watching Callie suffer through the most difficult of adolescent times brings up her own memories of a childhood spent with Callie’s mother, and causes her to question what she knows about the girl she is raising.This book is creatively written, interspersing notes from Callie to Rebecca and flashbacks from Rebecca’s childhood.  Additionally, this book is set apart not only because of the powerful voice and the realistic plot, but because Callie also tells her story throughout.  Callie shares how events really unfolded and the secrets she kept from those who thought they knew her best.This book is compelling and engaging.  It is filled with twists and turns and unfolds naturally. Callie and Rebecca could be your next door neighbor or a close friend. Frankel is fantastic at creating a beautiful mystery out of things that could otherwise seem too ordinary to merit extraordinary story telling.  This is a must read for anyone who knows any adolescents or remembers the challenges of being one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SC5GFGNIY4JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341805X#wasThisHelpful","R2SC5GFGNIY4JN","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I’ve been watching since you were breaking into the medicine cabinet and slathering Pond’s all over your face till you were pasty white and crumbling like some kind of moon child. What you didn’t realize was that you were just practicing the extreme-y, creamy measures you would one day take in a futile attempt to stop the relentless pull of gravity.”- Monica HeiseyI Can’t Believe It’s Not Better is a smart, funny, and open guide to all that keeps gals up at night as they think about their careers, dating, food, and friends.  Monica, with cleverness and Canadian spunk navigates all of life’s mundane events with humor and a level of honesty that is most often found among true friends. Writing about burritos, how to handle a party, odes to cheese, and good/bad mistakes, Heisey is original and refreshing. At times the book can be a bit too goofy or honest for comfort, but overall, it is a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I Can’t Believe It’s Not Better is entertaining, and while ideally suited for twenty-somethings, this is a great read for any lady interested in getting a laugh and having a light read for summertime!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5372ZVLYBVI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WX5YULU#wasThisHelpful","R5372ZVLYBVI4","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""What I saw there brought on a smile: backlit by the room behind her, Sister stood just barely over five feet tall, slightly hunched, wearing glasses, and attired in a full, traditional habit of long black veil, white coif, black tunic belted at the center, brown wooden rosary beads dangling from her waist, and sensible black shoes. There was just one deviation: she also wore a blue denim bib apron smeared with paint."" - John SchlimmA seemingly lost soul forced to return to his hometown and await a permanent teaching position, John takes an unexpected trip with a friend - not a long trip, just a trip down the street, but a trip that will forever change his life.  John visits the ceramic shop at the local convent, a shop that he never knew existed despite its location beside his alma mater, the Catholic high school where he substitute teaches.  That one trip changed his life and forged his bond with Sister Augustine, a petite and compassionate nun who crafts ceramic statues at the convent's shop. Her calm nature, her dedication to her faith, and her joyful demeanor allow her to endear herself rather quickly to John. Soon, they forge a friendship, and the bond they share revolves around much more than ceramic statues of angels and the virgin Mary.Over five years, Sister Augustine teaches John life lesson and ceramic sculpting. John learns lessons of humility and thoughtfulness from a woman who continued to craft works of art well into her eighties. He has conversations about death, faith, and family, all the while learning about himself and his dreams.  This book is unexpectedly touching.  I expected a story about a nun and the lessons she shared with a young man, but I did not expect to love the story for its beauty and power. Schlimm writes with incredible voice, transporting readers to the small ceramic shop, through five years of conversations and changing perspectives. Needless to say, Five Years in Heaven: The Unlikely Friendship that Answered Life's Greatest Questions was absolutely lovely - a must read for anyone needing inspiration, joy or renewed faith.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRDGRUYN2PJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553446576#wasThisHelpful","R1BRDGRUYN2PJL","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Most of us know that the way we eat is central to our well-being. But we may not always know exactly what ingredients to buy or meals to plan for the most satisfying, delicious and healthful results. This book will show you how easy it can be: Start with fresh produce, whole grains, and lean proteins; prepare them simply; and take the time to share and enjoy them.” - Martha StewartI love food. I love cooking food, eating food, and celebrating the way that healthy food makes me feel. In all honesty, though, there are times when too much of a good thing isn’t so good, and when I can’t seem to break out of a rut with the foods that I make.How refreshing it was to read Clean Slate, a beautiful book by the editors of Martha Stewart Living. The book is rich with information about the healthiest foods to integrate into your diet, the richest fruits and vegetables to make part of your daily routine, and the most delicious combination of antioxidant-packed foods in tempting recipes.  Rich photographs, a wealth of information, and a clearly organized collection of recipes identified as Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, and Nut-Free makes this book absolutely tempting. All of the recipes avoid butter, refined sugar, all-purpose flour and red meat, all in an effort to get readers the clean start they need to reexamine their eating and encourage new healthy habits.Options like Watercress and Potato Soup, Melon-Mint Smoothie, Squash Salad with Tomatoes, Zucchini Blossoms, and Ricotta, Warm Spinach White Bean Dip, Almond-Date Smoothie, Red Lentil Soup with Turnip and Parsley, and Lentil Burgers provide plenty of options for throughout the day.  The authors even include sweets that are healthy and delicious: Spiced Hot Dark Chocolate, Fig and Walnut Biscotti, and Coconut Water Ice Pops, among others. Overall, this book is an absolute treasure with options for anyone wishing to eat healthy and for all home chefs who are passionate about ingredients.A sample recipe featured at https://onceuponmyshelf.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/clean-slate-a-cookbook-and-guide/","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACPLOJN0US50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6YI6WS#wasThisHelpful","R3ACPLOJN0US50","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a vegan who works hard to incorporate protein and wholesome ingredients into my diet, I was so excited to see this book.  I had never heard of the author's blog, but looked at the book description and the reviews and felt confident with my purchase. When it arrived, though, I was so disappointed. The Amazon book preview stated that ""All of the recipes are (or can be easily made): gluten-free, soy-free, nut-free, dairy-free, vegan."" I am not sure how this is true as most of the recipes rely on a nut butter of some sort, and there are no specific suggestions for ingredient modifications. Additionally, despite the fact that I followed the recipes in every way (even using the specifically mentioned brands), the bars were mushy and runny (I had to freeze them just to get them to solidify).The flavors are great (German Chocolate Cake, Tiramisu, Caramel Macchiato, Peanut Butter Fudge, Chocolate Covered Strawberry, Orange Cranberry Quinoa, and Matcha Green Tea Almond Fudge, to name a few). Many, though, are covered in some sort of chocolate or caramel (making them a bit sweeter than I would like to see in my protein bars).

"“There’s a Japanese term I like to think of when it comes to many aspects of life – kaizen. It means ‘change for the better’ and consciously finessing, learning, and applying new ideas and experiences to shape a stronger, more successful daily process. Wellness is all about this type of continuous improvement.” – Heather CrosbyHeather Crosby, the visionary behind the YumUniverse blog, has compiled her wisdom and kitchen creativity into her cookbook.  YumUniverse is part memoir, part nutritional guide, and part tantalizing recipe collection.  With beautiful photos and approachable menu options, this cookbook is a wonderful addition to the collection of an experienced chef and a great introduction to vegan cooking for those trying to better understand a plant-based lifestyle.Crosby approaches the vegan lifestyle with wit and wisdom, honestly revealing her struggles with eating veggies and growing up loving junk food.  In an approachable manner, though, Crosby steps readers through a vegan pantry, transitioning to veganism, and eases readers into recipes that are both delicious, simple, and gluten-free.  With everything from how to  make a great egg substitute to how to create delicious non-dairy creams, this book is a compelling blend of resources and recipes. For example, Beautiful Breakfast Patties and Pear & Ginger Crepes are perfect complements to a weekend’s brunch. Toasted Superseed Power Bread and Chickpea Flatbread are just two of the tempting vegan gluten-free options here. Sweet Potato Sauce, Black Bean Soup, and Comforting Veggie Noodle Soup make for healthy and delicious dining.  Lentil Quinoa Kale Tacos, Asian Cabbage Salad and an entire chapter on sandwiches are a treat. Rainbow Veggie Ribbon Alfredo, Raspberry-Peach Fruit Leather, Salted Caramel Sauce, Mexican Unfried Ice Cream, and Maple Spiced Cream Sandwich Cookies are delicious! My only objection to this book is that there are only about a hundred (and not a million) menu items to choose from.Review and a recipe from onceuponmyshelf.wordpress.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXP5AROI5FZTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940363241#wasThisHelpful","RXP5AROI5FZTG","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a Chloe fan for a while and I was thrilled that she went back to a full menu for her third cookbook (while I loved her vegan desserts in her second book, it is nice to have diverse meal options here).  Chloe's Vegan Italian Kitchen is a true delight - it is jam packed with tantalizing recipes that are easy to make.  With options like White Wild Mushroom Pizza, Bowties in Garlic Cream Sauce, Eggplant Parmesan, and Wild Mushroom Farro with Lemon, Mint and Artichokes, there are a number of delicious dinner options There are great sides like Italian Chopped Salad, Cream of Mushroom Soup, and Broccoli Rabe with Garlicky Bread Bites.  There are even delicious desserts like Tiramisu and Italian Wedding Cake.  There are a number of gluten-, soy-, and nut-free recipes that are labeled clearly, and the food photos are completely tempting.  The one thing that is a bit goofy is the collection of Chloe-centered photos, but the food tastes so good that it is worth putting up with.  Overall, this is a book that I am thrilled to add to my collection - even my omnivore husband has been thrilled with the meals that I have made already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMTZLQ5EBNB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB7RG#wasThisHelpful","R2UMTZLQ5EBNB9","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Vegan Holiday Cooking is for people who love to cook and who are constantly looking for innovative and delicious recipes. It’s for people who love to spend time in the kitchen, either alone or with friends, and create beautiful vegan food that is full of flavor and love.  It’s for cooks who love to bring everyone to the table to celebrate and savor the holidays.” – Vegan Holiday CookingAs a vegan home chef, I love the ease of making a quick meal at home.  When it comes to celebrations and making something extra special, though, finding the perfect recipe can be difficult.  Too many cookbooks focus on the everyday without emphasizing special occasions.  Vegan Holiday Cooking from Candle Cafe by Joy Pierson, Angel Ramos, and Jorge Pineda is the exception.  This book makes vegan dining a year round celebration.With menus for the Super Bowl, Easter, Thanksgiving, Cinco de Mayo, and other essential holidays, this book is a year round treasure trove of vegan recipes.  Plus, the photos and detailed descriptions associated with the recipes make for a visually stunning and absolutely informative cookbook.  Plus, options like Mini Muffins with Homemade Preserves, Crispy Black Bean Tacos, Big Barbecue Seitan Burgers, Vegan Cheese Plate, and Warm Apple Turnovers and Champagne Ice Cream are sure to become year round favorites.  Others, like Braised Cranberry Orange Tofu, Christmas Pomegranate Punch, and Joy’s Grandma’s Seitan Brisket with Roasted Carrots, Shallots and Turnips, you will be able to make any holiday more festive and exciting.This gem of a collection features recipes to suit every palate – vegans and omnivores alike.  While the recipes are not labeled as gluten free, there are a number that fit the bill.  Overall, though, this book is a winner and perfect for any holiday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FTIQ2YI212C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JI58UD2#wasThisHelpful","R23FTIQ2YI212C","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The rhythms of life in Lebanon were unhurried, meaningful, and steeped in tradition. Food – both the preparation and the consumption – was a celebration of life, something to be savored and enjoyed. The ingredients were always fresh, the vegetables in season, and meat was eaten only once a week or on special occasions” – Joumana AccadI love eating international cuisines, but rarely do I feel confident with testing out exciting flavors in my own kitchen. Taste of Beirut by Joumana Accad, though, makes the delicious flavors of Lebanon a realistic option for any night of the week. With a wealth of insight regarding Lebanese cuisine (i.e. incorporate olives into every meal and lemons are used daily), and a diverse selection of delicious recipes, this book is an absolute treasure. The beautiful pictures and clear descriptions truly bring the flavors of Beirut to life.With recipes like Mint Pesto, Pine Nut Sauce, Turnip Pickles, and Walnut Sauce, there are delicious traditional sauces to enhance any recipe. Other options like Fava Bean Soup, Falafel Sandwich, Lentil Soup with Swiss Chard, Swiss Chard Stalks Dip, and Red Lentil and Pumpkin Dip are absolutely delicious.

"The water from the Mavea filter tastes delicious, but it has some odd flaws.  The filter is easy to install and the digital reader is easy to set.  The filter is set on a timer so that you must change it every 2 months regardless of how often you actually use it.  A bit of an odd setting.The water is added through the pitcher through a hole on the top that closes when the water reservoir is full.  Unfortunately, the hollow ""bobble"" closer does not close until there is no room left which actually leads to leaking from the handle and down the front of the pitcher (kind of frustrating as this mixes the tap water with the filtered water). The filtered water reservoir is pretty large, and the white color is neutral and subtle.  Overall, I really like this pitcher, but it takes some getting used to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWO2Y4QZVYYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002T2OPSA#wasThisHelpful","R2EWO2Y4QZVYYA","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazon picture does not do this bottle justice.  This bottle is a tall glass bottle that has a watermelon colored silicone wrapper with cute oblong cutouts. The silicone wrapper goes from the very bottom of the bottle to about an inch from the mouth opening.  The mouth of the bottle is about an inch in diameter and the glass is of a medium-thickness (I have another glass water bottle with a large opening and it is thick glass which makes for a heavy and clunky water bottle). The lid is a tear-shaped plastic piece that has a silicone stopper which is the only piece of the lid which actually touches the mouth of the bottle. The label says that this bottle is BPA free, phtalate free, lead free and responsibly produced. So far, it has proven to be durable for room temperature water (I don't like cold or icy water, so I am not sure how that would impact anything).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1REJUW1V8H59A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK0ORVW#wasThisHelpful","R1REJUW1V8H59A","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“When you do something over and over again, gradually increasing the difficulty, that’s how you get major brain change.” – Bend Your BrainI am a fan of puzzles, logic problems, word games, and brain benders.

"“Like many kids, I loved candy,  but less for eating it than for their colors and shapes and packaging.  I thought of it as another craft material possibility.” – Jodi LevineWhile I may not be the craftiest person around, I love cooking, baking and decorating, and when I feel particularly inspired, I will give crafting a whirl as long as the project is fun and enticing.  Things may be about to change, though.  Jodi Levine, a long-time staffer for Martha Stewart Living Magazine has perfected the art of creating decorations, candy, and even jewelry out of candy.  The themes are diverse – marshmallow polar bears, candy cane bowls, and clown cupcake toppers.  The steps are easy, and the results are adorable.  The projects are easy enough to get kids excited and promote creativity (many require little more than hard candy, marshmallows, or simple kitchen ingredients).

"I love cooking and I love trying out new recipes.  While there are some flashy and bold cookbooks, some of the recipes lack flavor and originality.  Naturally, I was thrilled when I read Vegan Beans from Around the World by Kelsey Kinser.  This book is wonderful.  What is lacks in flashy photos and elaborately staged meals, it makes up for in originality and flavor. This book has quickly become a staple in my cooking routine and I cannot recommend it enough.Kinser has taken the time to create a vast repertoire of bean-based menu items that are simply amazing.  They are hearty and filling, but easy to make.  With options like African Peanut Soup, Dutch Split Pea Soup, Greek Lentil Salad, and Indonesian Raw Veggie Salad, there are a number of ways to create a light lunch. Main dishes like Falafel, Italian ""Meat"" Balls, Chana Masala, Chickpea Couscous, and Southwestern Chili are absolutely delicious (and are able to appeal to vegans and omnivores alike).  There are a number of kitchen staples like Cashew Sour Cream, Hummus and Soy Milk that are easily made with Kinser's guidance.  Additionally, dessert options like Sweet Red Bean Paste, Chickpea Cupcakes, and Navy Bean Pie are a wonderful way to incorporate the protein, fiber, and nutrients of beans into a wonderful treat.Vegan Beans from Around the World is a wonderful book - both for beginning and veteran vegans - and is a simple, straightforward guide to creating delicious bean-based menu items deliciously!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWK7ZMOH7KBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612432859#wasThisHelpful","RQWK7ZMOH7KBT","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this book for a class and I am so glad that I had the chance to read it.  It is a captivating read that is absolutely eye-opening in its examination of the current American education system, the future of our nation's education system, and how we stack up against other nations.  Darling-Hammond, a Standford professor and an education advocate is very aware of the realities of testing, funding inequality, and teacher preparation and how each influences our current system.  The school to prison-pipeline, charter schools, and innovative teacher preparation programs are all taken into consideration as Darling-Hammond examines the current system. With strong data, dynamic cases, and eloquent voice, Darling-Hammond makes a clear case of what has gone wrong in education as it is currently employed, and makes compelling suggestions about what can be done to return America to its former glory as a strong educationally-minded nation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12J7XXQKRRH1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807749621#wasThisHelpful","R12J7XXQKRRH1C","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some books are spooky, some romantic, and some are a combination of the two.  The Vanishing by Wendy Web is a ghostly tale set in a mysterious, wooded mansion near the Canadian border and has just enough spookiness to keep you scared, and a hint of love to warm your heart.Julia is the widow of a Chicago investor who swindled millions from his clients.  Spiraling into a depression because her husband’s victims have been coming after her since he took his own life, Julia is thrilled when she gets the opportunity to escape it all and “vanish” with the help of a mysterious stranger.  Adrian Sinclair is the wealthy son of Amaris Sinclair, a famous writer who supposedly died decades ago.  In reality, though, Amaris has been hiding away from the public eye and Adrian offers to help Julia escape if she is willing to act as a friend to his aged mother.  When Julia meets Amaris, and the rest of the staff at the Havenwood Estate, she begins to suspect that there is more to the story.Dimly lit halls, ghostly apparitions, night time visitors, and footprints in the snow cause her to suspect that she may have been brought here for a very different reason.  Also, the fact that she so closely resembles a woman in a painting from a century ago makes her question the motives of the Sinclairs.This book has twists and turns and a unique plot; I came to like Julia and cheer her on as she tried to solve the mystery of Havenwood.  It is well worth a read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11K0ZOHYXWT5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401341942#wasThisHelpful","R11K0ZOHYXWT5V","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gabrielle Bernstein has gained a following for her common sense strategies focusing on calming, reflection, and spiritual growth.  Her new book, Miracles Now, emphasizes a number of simple strategies in the form of meditations to allow you to become more conscientious, less anxious, and live a more confident life.Although many of us are busy and rush about our daily lives, Miracles Now provides a wonderful starting point for beginning to calm down just a bit.  Each short reflection (no more than a few moments to read) emphasizes a way to connect to God, develop healthier habits, or help yourself and others.  Additionally, a brief Miracle Message follows the passage and is the perfect saying to ponder throughout the day (or tweet out as Bernstein suggests). For example, in the “Happiness is a Choice You Make” excerpt focusing on looking for happiness in God, not the external world, the Miracle Message is a simple statement: happiness is a choice I make.With over 100 reflections that range from powerful to commonsense, Bernstein has collected a set of advice to enhance your spiritual life, decrease anxiety, and celebrate life. Messages ranging from Stop Obsessing and Your Eyes Will See What You Desire to Lose the Stage fright and Pray Before You Pay are refreshing and motivating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4OZAOQAPQMA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944345#wasThisHelpful","R4OZAOQAPQMA9","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a bit wary of purchasing these initially.  I wasn't sure if they would fit my Clarisonic Mia.  Fortunately, they were a perfect fit and work as well as the original ones at a fraction of the cost.  I had been overpaying for the Clarisonic ones for years; now I know to stick with these.  The one thing that is a bit different is that these come in a blank box with no directions, so a first-time user may be a bit confused.  Also, I noticed that these were a bit rougher than the Clarisonic brand for the first few uses, but either the bristles softened slightly or I grew used to the extra scrubbing.  Well worth the purchase overall, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBTF9YCS626C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HIHJUQI#wasThisHelpful","R2IBTF9YCS626C","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this book thinking that it would be a wonderful collection of short stories to better understand the events of Japan's triple disaster. The book is a set of short stories - both fiction and nonfiction - but some were so far out there and disconnected from the disaster that I had a hard time appreciating them.One story is about a bear who goes for a walk with a neighbor (human) after the disaster; another is about an imaginary dog who helps children recover from the disaster by taking on their ailments.  I recognize that these stories reflect a cultural element, but much of the book is creative fiction with little commentary on the disaster events - ""Hiyoriyama"", for example.There are a few gems within this book, but overall it is a bit of a disappointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKVSJ8CFSLP9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307948862#wasThisHelpful","RKVSJ8CFSLP9E","A2QJ6O5P244HJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QJ6O5P244HJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently moved my home-office into our second bedroom because it's much more conducive to working on my doctoral studies.  The only drawback is the Internet connection comes through the wall of the former office.  This means I have to connect via our home-Wi-Fi connection.  The old card I had was an 802.11g and reached less than half the bandwidth available.  So I decided to buy a new card.  The TP-LINK installed quickly and easily.  Just before I opened the case to install it, I went to their website and downloaded the driver.  This way I knew I'd have the latest and wouldn't have to deal with updating after the installation; plus I've done away with CD/DVD drives.  After installing the new card, I started up the system and ran the driver installation.  It immediately detected the card and installed drivers in less than 1 minute.  When I ran a broadband speed test I got the maximum upload and download speeds of my router!  It's blazing fast and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  Also, it comes with both standard and low-profile brackets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PW68UPGQPSM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GMPZ0A#wasThisHelpful","R2PW68UPGQPSM5","A3T8H7A2EESBZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T8H7A2EESBZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best topical product I've found so far.  I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and have for years.  Most pain relievers only diminish the pain for a few hours.  This stuff works all day!  It also works rather quickly.  The first time I applied it to my arm, which was throbbing from pain, it took about 10 minutes before the pain was completely gone and I'd forgotten all about my neuropathy until the next day when it reared its ugly head.  I've tried other topicals like this, but this is the only one with staying power!  Just be careful not to apply too much or to particularly sensitive areas, because it can burn.  I'd recommend trying out a small amount on the affected area and wait about 10 to 15 minutes.

"So far so good!  I bought this fan a week ago to help cool my system, especially the GPU, which was getting exceedingly hot after recent upgrades I'd performed on the system.  Now the system is purring like a kitten.  The blue light is a little bright but certainly not cornea-burning as some have suggested.  If your PC is in your bedroom, then this makes for a great nightlight.  The small amount of white noise emanating from it is barely noticeable and somewhat soothing.  Installation took a Phillips-head screwdriver and less than 5 minutes to complete.The one fact I overlooked when purchasing this fan is that it has just 3 pins instead of 4.  This simply means that while my system monitoring software can detect the fan and its speed, it cannot manipulate the speed automatically.

"We live in a circa 1920's brick 3-flat in Chicago.  Additionally, we live on a busy street with a school across from us and an alley beside us.  Due to the heavy traffic and dirt alley, we get a lot of dust in the house.  Even during the winter when all the windows are closed the dust builds up in just a day or two.  We decided to purchase two Whirlpool HEPA filtration units and positioned them at either ends of the house.  What a difference these units make.  The filters aren't cheap, but they last an entire year.  We've had both units going 24/7 for the past 3 years and they just keep going strong.  Dust is no longer a problem and the house can go a week or more before dust begins building up.

I just purchased three different flavors of this popcorn at HomeGoods and absolutely love that it is not only gluten-free, but certified gluten-free by GFS Labs -- One of the most prestigious testing facilities of its kind and with the most sensitive gluten-sensitivity testing available at 3 PPM.  This is important to people like me who suffer from celiac disease and cannot tolerate even the smallest traces of gluten.I also like that instead of sugar, they use corn syrup as a sweetener.  Not high fructose corn syrup, but just plain corn syrup, which makes it sweet, but not overly so.  And unlike similar products, it's NOT greasy.

"I've always wanted a cake decorating kit.  After being diagnosed with a gluten-related disorder nearly a decade ago, I've had to learn to cook and bake at home.  I've gotten pretty good at the cooking part and have started to focus more on baking.  So when I got this kit I was delighted to finally begin to make fancy desserts.  My very first project was with a cocoa buttercream frosting.  It wasn't half-bad, but I definitely needed more practice.  This device is very intuitive and after just a couple of uses I began to become pretty proficient.  My biggest mistake so far was not allowing the cupcakes to cool long enough before topping them with the frosting.  There is a huge assortment of shapes I've not yet had the chance to try, but so far this has been a great addition to my baking arsenal.  Clean up is effort-free.  Just soak in soap and water for a few minutes and they clean up nicely.

"As someone with a gluten-related disorder (celiac disease) who must avoid cross contact with other potentially-hazardous foods, it's comforting to know products like this exist and are readily available.  Even with the FDA's recent declaration the BPA plastic products are considered safe, I prefer to err on the safe side and know for certain I'm not getting them in my body.  This splatter guard has been a God-send.  It not only protects my food from falling splatter, but also protects my microwave oven from unnecessary splatter.  Making cleanup a breeze.  It's flat, so storage is no trouble at all.  It's also light weight and easy to take with you on the road.  I especially like the fact it fits small and large dishes.  The holes in the top work really well to vent steam and there's no risk of the lid flying off and exploding food everywhere.  I found it most useful for bowls of hot soup.  The only issue had experienced with the splatter guard was when heating food on a plate.  The guard has no sides, so it lays flat on top of your food.  If you happen to have cheese in the dish, it will tend to stick.  Also, if the dish does splatter, it will shoot out sideways onto the walls of the microwave.  Of course, that's easily remedied by using bowls instead of plates.  It's not a big issue, but definitely would have encouraged me to give it the full five stars.  The price is also reasonable, albeit, I think it went up since I got mine several weeks ago.

"For me? This book is absolutely five stars (I'll explain why I deducted a star a bit later).Elizabeth Gilbert's TED Talk on creativity was a beautiful, honest, emotional piece about success and failure and what it means to be creative. Since then, I've been happy to listen to anything she has to say on creativity and writing.So this book is an absolute gift. It's a collection of very short essays on different topics, divided into six sections: Courage, Enchantment, Permission, Persistence, Trust, and Divinity.Within those, she has some solid, practical advice, and some more inspirational, theoretical ideas. She talks about how fear is just part of the package when you're doing something creative, so you need to recognize it's going to be there and learn not to let it make decisions for you. She talks about how sometimes ideas come to you but they're not actually for you (which is why you might struggle to create) - so we're not ""stealing"" ideas from each other, but they're floating around and hopefully you're aware enough to catch them. She talks about failure and regret and inspiration.I absolutely loved it.So why only 4 stars? Because while it's subtitled ""Creative Living Beyond Fear,"" and she offers lip service a few times to non-writing creativity, she's really talking about writing. So for writers - 5 stars. For other artists - 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4HTG8QKFWWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634718#wasThisHelpful","R3V4HTG8QKFWWY","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last activity monitor I had was the BodyBugg, which I really liked, except it had no display, so every time you wanted to see how you were doing, you had to check the app.Here there is an app, but you get most of the same information on the device, so you don't have to sync as frequently (or at all, frankly). There are apparently also an associated scale and ""sleep system"" (to control the temperature of your bed).This will definitely win no awards for style - the nuyu, frankly, looks cheap. It is a little square you can either snap into a rubbery plastic wristband, or put on a magnetic strap to wear on your belt. I thought for sure I would be popping the nuyu out of the band accidentally all the time, but that actually hasn't happened at all - it's very secure. So if you absolutely must have something attractive, this is not your activity tracker, but it's mostly unobtrusive and far cheaper than the alternative.The nuyu is also water-resistant. I wore it in the shower just to make sure it was as advertised, but I have to say I'm not entirely sure why that's a feature. So I don't miss out on the three steps I take turning around in the shower? Well, whatever. If that's important to you, note that it really is water-resistant.App: The app has a lower limit of 66 lbs and an upper limit of 331 lbs for your weight. I thought at first this might be a limitation of the nuyu scale, but that states no lower limit and an upper limit of 400 lbs. So if you're below or above those weights, you can still use it, but your calorie amounts won't be correct. Also, as other people have noted, the privacy policy you have to accept to use the app is ridiculous. Get it together, nuyu.Accuracy - well, here's where things fall apart. If you're comfortable knowing generally about how many calories you burn, steps you take, and sleep you get, this is fine. But if you're looking for precision statistics, I would doubt the nuyu.Sleep: It regularly overestimates my sleep, sometimes by an hour or more. Sometimes randomly it will add twenty minutes of sleep time during my day when I didn't sleep, and a couple of times I took naps and it didn't register it at all. Documentation on the nuyu is nil, so I'm not sure how it's judging sleep. By how much time I spend lying down? By pulse rate? If so, should I be wearing the wrist strap more tightly?Steps: The overall daily numbers are probably pretty close to right, but I usually sync it in the morning right when I wake up, and it tells me I've taken between 60-100 steps. I don't think I sleepwalk, and though I do often get up in the night to use the bathroom, that's a matter of ten steps, not 72. Anyway, overall I think it's probably generally close. Certainly if you're using it to monitor yourself and keep yourself motivated, it's fine.Calories: I have done my calories in an online calculator a few times and I come out within a few hundred. Again, documentation is lacking, so how are they calculating this? Off heart rate? Body temperature? Simple steps and weight algorithm?Battery life: The nuyu uses replaceable batteries (one of the reasons it's cheaper). The first battery I used that came with it failed in 3 days (syncing once a day - I keep the bluetooth on my phone off to preserve battery life). The second battery that I installed has been going steady for over a week.I like the nuyu, and for the price, it's fine. I wish it had better (read = any) documentation so I could understand how it works and use it better. But if you're looking for some general stats to challenge yourself to take better care of your health, this is a fine choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JN9L8KX76JZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRPT6Z0#wasThisHelpful","R2JN9L8KX76JZX","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me, this is a little bit of a solution in search of a problem - I've never really had a problem checking the temp of a shower with my hand, but I guess for the novelty value of knowing what temperature you like your shower at, this is a good thing.

I find that unless I reapply constantly, my lips feel just as dry as before I used it.But the larger issue is that it contains a number of seed oils, including soybean oil, and we prefer something that's made of better ingredients, like coconut oil and beeswax (this includes these ingredients, but also a number of less healthy oils - even canola oil?!?!).If you are less picky about ingredients and don't live in a very arid climate, you may have better luck.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XR1TXB9419WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ2X690#wasThisHelpful","R1XR1TXB9419WA","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never been entirely happy with my Cuisinart, so I was curious about a replacement. I like Black & Decker's mini-choppers, despite their limitations, so I thought this one seemed worth a chance.And I'm really impressed!I love that it comes with numerous blades and disks (just a couple more than my Cuisinart) instead of having to buy extras. And the REAL bonus - there's a smartly designed storage unit for them. It's another thing you have to find space for in your kitchen, but it's so compact for all it holds I don't mind. We bought a stand-alone Cuisinart brand blade/disc storage container and it feels cheap and has never worked properly.Warning: as with my Black & Decker chopper, these blades are SHARP. Within minutes of opening this thing, I had sliced a finger pretty deep with the main chopping blade just by brushing my finger against it.It also comes with two bowls - an 11 cup and a 4-cup. Yes, the 11 cup is smaller than my 14-cup Cuisinart, BUT, here's the thing: one of the reasons I've never liked the Cuisinart is that the blade sits so low I have to process in batches. So what's the point of a 14-cup bowl if I can't fill it? It's also nice not to have to use the enormous bowl if I'm only making pesto, for instance.Another advantage is that the base of the Cuisinart's bowl has a hole so big I always fear spilling when I'm taking it off the base, and I have to hold the blade in place.This is set up differently, with a smaller shaft to hold the blades and discs and less risk of spilling.The motor is strong and the blades are sharp. We made an ice cream recipe that involves frozen bananas and ice cubes, and the Black & Decker handled both no problem. And even though the blade sits low in the bowl, I didn't have to constantly take off the lid and move the food around in order to have it get to everything.We've made pesto, marinades, ice cream, and mashed cauliflower. In addition, I've used the slicing and chopping disks, both of which worked just great. We don't keep it on the counter, but it does have a nice look if you want to.If I had to buy another food processor, I'd choose this one over my Cuisinart.

"This was my least favorite of the Schuyler sisters trilogy, but I do like Beatriz Williams' books.If you've never read one of her books before, do not pass Go, do not collect $200, but proceed directly to A Hundred Summers. Then you can work your way through the Schuyler trilogy, starting with The Secret Life of Violet Grant.This works better as part of the trilogy than as a stand-alone book. I thought Pepper was the most interesting part of Tiny Little Thing, but unfortunately in this story, she's not developed much further. Mostly she exists to listen to someone else's story - Annabelle Dommerich, who owns the historical storyline in this book. I find WWII narratives to be a big yawn, so this was a disappointment for me, as neither storyline grabbed me.However! Beatriz Williams writes a good, fast-paced story. Most of her characters are emotionally chilly, but they sure do lead interesting lives.

"This book was interesting, but for me not life-changing. As someone who's fairly risk-averse but feels more risk would make my life better, I wanted to see what I could learn.Kreamer's central thesis is that people, work-wise, fall into one of five categories:Pioneers, who are ""very decisive"" and ""the most entrepreneurial"" of the categories, and the most willing to take risks.Thinkers (most common type), who are interested in ""sensible risks"", but don't take them because of ""worry about finances and family stability.""Defenders (second most common), who ""like things to be predictable"" and think about work more as a paycheck than ""a calling.""Intentional Drifters, who ""intentionally choose a free-form, freewheeling"" approach to their work.Unintentional Drifters, who ""have ended up in less-than-satisfying jobs due to external forces"" and are disappointed by this.Kreamer then devotes a section to each type, giving examples, explaining how the type works, and how the type can learn to embrace risk (and therefore reap rewards) in their own way. I guess I would be categorized as a Thinker, but the description didn't entirely resonate with me, and the strategies she offered (carefully thinking through career options, trying things out) felt fair, if unexciting. Maybe if you feel like a type really fits you, you will have a different experience.There are other useful tidbits in here, mostly about how to think about risk - not as a blip, but as the way of the future and the past - and how it benefits us in our working lives. It's a quick and easy read, and worth checking out if you are interested in the question of risk.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWW80DBO7SHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067987#wasThisHelpful","R1MWW80DBO7SHQ","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I hadn't been reading this for review, I would have abandoned it with a three-star rating about a quarter of the way through. This is the problem with reading a book you're lukewarm on all the way to the end - what is a mild disappointment becomes irrational resentment by the end.So I'll try not to be irrational.The best part of this book, hands-down, is the description of the John Muir Trail, where the main character Liz is hiking. The author's acknowledgements state that she hiked the trail herself, so the descriptions are really detailed and loving. Sometimes they veer into travelogue rather than plot, but because I was ultimately more interested in the trail than the story, I was okay with that. If you want an intro to hiking but don't feel like reading a guidebook, this would do fine for that.The suspense at the beginning regarding the bad guys was good, but since most of the book they just show up and are menacing for a page and then disappear again - in both the story and the main character's emotions - it wasn't sustainable for me.Liz has a lot of secrets and issues she needs to work through, but the author can't really come up with any better way for her to divulge them than randomly blurting out words which lead to a confession to her partner, who has an incredibly inconsistent moral code and the personality of cardboard.A lot of how you feel about this book will depend on how you react to Liz and her choices in the past. I was put off by one of them in particular and it colored my view of her for the rest of the book, especially because her explanation for why she'd done it was pretty flimsy, and it seemed like an irresponsible choice for a fully-grown adult in a committed relationship. But maybe you're more forgiving and you'll like her more.If you want a story about hiking the John Muir Trail, this is fine, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQS7PT4NW1LL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472144#wasThisHelpful","ROQS7PT4NW1LL","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Shannon Stacey book I have read, and the second in this series, after Taken with You (The Kowalskis). These are part of a series, but while Taken With You was fine on its own, this one was a little harder to fully appreciate without the benefit of having read the others. This is partly because Liz and Drew apparently hooked up at someone else's wedding in a previous book, but mostly because a large portion of the book involves the extended Kowalski family, and given that I had no previous attachments to them, they were just names here.But that's not necessarily a flaw, depending on how you feel about series, just fair warning.Anyway, I liked both Liz and Drew. He's your standard-issue sexy small-town sheriff, but his protectiveness didn't come off as creepy as it often does. He was just straightforward and earnest and interested in Liz. For a fun twist, she was the one who was reluctant to commit and creeped out by how everyone immediately goes from zero to babies (which is a nice point about romance novels in general). But, shocker, she comes around in the end. Given that this is a romance, I'm not going to call that a spoiler.But the obstacles keeping them apart were kind of meh. Mostly something about her brother not wanting them to be together is the major issue, which seemed flimsy to me. Maybe it would make more sense if I read his book, but that I do think is a flaw - it should have been clear here why a man not wanting his friend to date his sister just because was an issue for a bunch of grown-ass adults. And her reluctance to commit is overcome so suddenly, literally in the course of one conversation, that it clearly was never an issue to begin with.However, I'm still rating this three stars, because it was a sweet, diverting read, with a little spice. I preferred Taken With You, but this was still a nice way to spend an afternoon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V50336W3RWUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373002254#wasThisHelpful","R2V50336W3RWUM","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As someone who travels and makes presentations, I have to say these are lifesavers. Easier to carry than a big flip chart, reusable, and very flexible.They're not complex - it's just a plastic sheet that adheres to a surface using static cling. I've used them on whiteboards (so I can write and then move the notes to a wall instead of erasing) and walls. The only place they wouldn't adhere was a brick wall - not enough smooth surface.Fun side note - my students LOVE them. Grown-ups turn into kids when you give them dry erase markers and a surface to draw on, and all the places I've used them at people have just thought they were the coolest.Just like a whiteboard, you can erase and use them again. The Expo markers are slightly lighter than on a whiteboard, and much lighter than a regular marker on a flip chart, so if you've got folks with limited vision or a really large room, they're not ideal.I wish they were a little smaller to be able to get the box easily into the different kinds of luggage I use for carry-on, but that's pretty much my only complaint.

"Apparently, I've been living under a rock, because I had never heard of this blog or the ensuing kerfuffle over it. In addition, I don't even eat sandwiches, and I hate books with recipes. I chose to read it because I like a good memoir and a good love story, and I was interested in what she had to say about the internet backlash she received.I have to say if you like sandwiches and recipes, you may dig this book. There are not recipes for all 300 sandwiches in here, but there are plenty, and lots of them sound tasty.But the narrative between them felt thin and disappointing. Smith is a journalist, so she's a competent writer, but it reads - surprise, surprise - like she took her blog entries and stuck a bunch of recipes between them. It all feels like a report, not an analysis, even when she talks about her father's cancer and her own lumpectomy.To me, the best part of the book was when she discusses the internet attacks on her, but she's strangely unemotional about that (again with the reporting), and it's only seriously dealt with for fewer than ten pages. And as for the love story - I didn't find that very captivating either.Solid meh from me, with the recognition that if you are a serious foodie who doesn't just glance at the recipes, you might enjoy it more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBHEW2UDUUF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391607#wasThisHelpful","RHBHEW2UDUUF9","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 stars rounded up.If you asked me to write a summary of this book without looking at the back, I'd start with something like, ""Audrey narrates a story about her older brother Frank, and his conflict with his mother over how much he plays video games."" For the first third to half of the book, Audrey feels like an afterthought.Sophie Kinsella's voice is fun and sharp and funny (I very, very rarely laugh aloud when reading and I did twice in this book), just like her Shopaholic series.Storywise, however, I felt this was really flawed. Audrey is suffering from a severe anxiety disorder and depression, and you can piece together that this condition is a result of some serious bullying at school - severe enough that multiple students were expelled and an administrator fired. However, anything of substance is only alluded to - both the initial incidents and her breakdown. Because those are so vague, her symptoms and recovery are also vague, and what heals her in the end is, basically, getting a boyfriend.It was okay for a while for the core issues to be avoided, because she's not ready to face them yet. But when she does start to recover, it would have been easier to sympathize with and cheer for her if she faced her demons instead of just darting around them.This was just a missed opportunity. Not every book has to be a Lesson, but if you're going to tackle subjects like bullying and depression, tackle them. Don't meander around them for a few hundred pages and call it good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBSS2ICSC59HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553536516#wasThisHelpful","RBSS2ICSC59HP","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fine eyelash curler, though I'm not sure what makes it ""ultimate."" It's the same size as my trusty Sephora eyelash curler, and the pads are interchangeable. The feel of it as far as tension is the same too.I suppose the distinguishing feature of this is the ""conditioning"" pads, which feels kind of gimmicky. The pad seem to be the same material as regular eyelash curler pads, so whatever chamomile is ""infused"" into them is likely staying inside and not getting on your lashes. And you're only holding the pad against your lashes for a few seconds, and then probably applying a bunch of chemicals on top of them, so I'm not sure what good it's supposed to do. In addition, as others have mentioned, Googling doesn't seem to turn up anywhere to buy replacement pads, so after you're done, you can't replace them anyway.I only mention that because that seems to be its distinguishing feature. Otherwise, it's just an eyelash curler, and it works just fine for that purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7HG08ALK80A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOZ3FBK#wasThisHelpful","R3S7HG08ALK80A","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book can be read very quickly, but I'm not entirely sure it should be. It took me a few re-reads of the first pages to get into the style, which is elegant stream-of-consciousness. You're in the narrator's head quite intimately.I responded to a lot of these issues - the dream of being an Art Monster versus the reality of family and bills to pay, the push-pull of motherhood, the confusion of betrayal. She's unhappy, but unclear about what she wants. She thinks her husband is perfect which only makes her feel more imperfect.“My plan was to never get married. I was going to be an art monster instead. Women almost never become art monsters because art monsters only concern themselves with art, never mundane things. Nabokov didn't even fold his own umbrella. Vera licked his stamps for him.”It's often unexpectedly funny (my favorite: calling therapy 'The Little Theater of Hurt Feelings), and even more often thought-provoking. Another favorite: “But now it seems possible that the truth about getting older is that there are fewer and fewer things to make fun of until finally there is nothing you are sure you will never be.”This book is about marriage and identity and compromise and art and a million other things. I enjoyed the first read and would like to read it again, because despite its slender size, there is a lot to think about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGSO0EEORQXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350813#wasThisHelpful","R2UGSO0EEORQXH","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a flat iron, I would give this four stars. As a curling device, I would give it one.Some advantages over a traditional flat iron - it's light and you can use the brush to add extra smoothness. I also like that the top of the iron doesn't heat up so you can hold it with both hands (well, one hand on the handle and fingertips on the other end). It doesn't get too hot and there is no burning hair smell.However, the bristles mean you can't get the iron close to the roots of your hair, so you can't straighten from end to end. In addition, I've ended up with many more broken flyaways at the roots - I wonder if this is due to the brush?There's a lock to use it as a hot brush so you don't have to hold it closed. However, and I had the same problem with the InStyler Wet To Dry Rotating Iron, Purple, 1-1/4 Inch, the brush means that I never got good curls out of it. Whatever the heat does, the bristles of the brush ruin. In order to have good curl, the hairs have to cling together, and I found it impossible to make that happen with the brush. That said, my hair is thick and it's hard to get it to hold a non-natural curl in general, so read other reviews and see what others think.Since this doesn't really perform either function (straightening or curling) perfectly, I can't say I'd recommend it, but it's okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKX9B8YK1XJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ9008#wasThisHelpful","REKX9B8YK1XJP","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to love Marian Keyes, but her last few books have left me cold, including this one.Keyes' gift has always been approaching really difficult subjects - alcoholism, eating disorders, depression, domestic violence - by wrapping them in seemingly lighthearted stories, blending in humor and often flat-out silliness. That's still present here, but it doesn't quite work.Problem #1 is that the book's structure is confusing. She leaps repeatedly between time periods over the past 4 years. Some of that is handled with a change in font (major pet peeve), but then in the 'present day' font, she often veers into a lengthy flashback that just left me confused as to when we were in the story.Problem #2 is that the narrator, Stella, is unengaging. She's depressed, which is important to write about, but mostly means she spends a lot of time remembering things and eating her feelings. She didn't have any believable active conflict. The past, even when she's bedridden and (unbelievably) communicating by blinking her eyelids (not a spoiler - this comes out quite early on), is more interesting than the fallout, points about karma aside.And problem #3 is related - the mystery of how she got to where she is in present-day is thin and dragged out. It's easy to figure out who she thinks is responsible early on, and then the story just meanders around for 450 pages. If I hadn't had to finish this for a review, I would have tossed it after 50 pages.I feel terrible giving this a negative review, because Marian Keyes has given us lots of great books, but this just felt sloppy. However, I have read some positive reviews (was released already in the UK), so other people might have more fun.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBXZXAMK1EVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525429255#wasThisHelpful","RHBXZXAMK1EVB","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was very much just an okay read for me, but that was personal preference. I can see people enjoying this much more than I did.There's a busy plot with lots of characters to remember and lots of complications, which make it feel busy instead of just waiting for Ty and Vicky to get together. There's a sense of humor and some pretty slapsticky moments, which keep it lighthearted.There's a high sensuality level, which I usually like, but too often veered into crassness for my taste (eg repeated use of the word 'tit,' which is just kind of juvenile to me). Ty's wound over his wife's death was (a) jarringly dark for such an often wacky book (b) inconsistent and (c) offputting as the reason Vicky and Ty were initially at odds. I just can't see him getting over her involvement with the case so quickly. There were also too many other potential and past partners of Ty - when the hero and heroine meet, I want that to be it for each other, while Ty is happily feeling up and considering more with another woman well after his connection to Vicky has been established.I could nitpick like that all day, but in the end, it was enjoyable, so I'll rate it three stars with the knowledge that if you aren't put off by the things I am, you might like it more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MFWFJNOP2KDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062282263#wasThisHelpful","R2MFWFJNOP2KDA","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually just let my hair air-dry, partly to keep the curl in it, but mostly because I'm lazy. But when I do blow it dry, it ends up so frizzy I end up having to flat-iron it to make it look normal. My hope was this would solve both problems at once.For the record, my hair is chin-length and wavy/curly, and very thick.And it kind of does. It takes almost as long to dry my hair as a blow-dryer, but less time than blow-drying and then flat-ironing it. THE TRICK: Read the directions! If you're using it on wet hair, you can't drag it down like you would a flat iron. You have to hold it in place for a few seconds as you make your way down the section. This feels weird, because if you do this with a flat iron on wet hair, it'll start to burn and smell and break. But this works. However, it's not a blow-dryer, nor is it a miracle, so I wouldn't expect either of those things!It does not leave my hair with stick-straight ends like a flat iron, which I liked - I prefer not looking like straw. It also doesn't get as straight as a flat iron, and the roots were still frizzy, as with a blow dryer.I didn't have luck using it as a curling iron, which I think is a design flaw. For the record, my hair doesn't hold artificial curl well, because it's so heavy, but I think the issue here is that you create a curl with the heat, and then the tines of the brush/comb part break the curl right back up. There might be a trick to this, but I won't use it as a curling iron so I didn't bother researching further.I'll be honest - for the price, I might have been disappointed. But if you're lazy like me and are looking for something that will get your hair mostly dry without frizz or the scary burning smell of a flat iron, this is a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34DDH8EE6JY6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ8V5I#wasThisHelpful","R34DDH8EE6JY6J","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just a reminder: ""Student"" edition means limited in features, not any easier.I was a regular user of Photoshop and InDesign a few years ago. And while time has passed, I imagine I could still do some of the more basic tasks - create objects and fill them, import and place photos, maybe do some light editing.CorelDRAW is more analogous to Adobe Illustrator, which I have never used. However, I thought my skills would translate, but I still felt quite lost when I first started. It's taken me two weeks to get the basics down, and I still feel far from being to emulate the more complex tasks that make Ilustrator so attractive and are the reason I was interested in it.There are hints on the right side, and easily accessible videos (Corel is big on videos, which can be helpful, but I would always rather read instructions - the link in the software takes you to the searchable manual online).If you're looking for an Adobe alternative, this is certainly feature-rich, but I have found it more complex than I would need and not terribly user-friendly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODPTO42Z9L8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYYMX4W#wasThisHelpful","R2ODPTO42Z9L8E","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a firm 'meh' from our cats. The first few times we took it out, they were engaged. They batted at the feathers and occasionally captured them, dragging it away (very awkward with the heavy ball at the base) to groom or ""kill"" it.The ball spins, but doesn't really move on our wood floors. We have a similar toy that rolls across the room that they seem to enjoy more. The feathers are definitely very attractive to them, but now that they've seen what it does, they tend to watch it for a few moments and then walk away.Long term, I worry about the feathers - they aren't sturdily attached and they don't seem easily replacable (I guess you have to buy an entirely new wand).All this said, our cats tend to like things that act more like prey - moving erratically across an entire room, rather than just spinning in one place.

"I gave up the Shopaholic series after Shopaholic & Sister, which I thought was not just unfunny, but offensive. But for some reason I felt like I light read, so I chose this, and it's good. Unsurprisingly, I haven't really missed any plot developments except for her having a baby, who's basically ignored in this book, so not a problem.Look, if you want high literature, look elsewhere. But if you want light, silly escapades that strain credibility and a book you can read in a few hours, here's the one. Becky is in LA here, and her new obsession is with celebrity. She's decided she wants to be a stylist to the stars, and spends the book getting into one ridiculous situation after another in pursuit of the dream. When she stumbles into her own celebrity, she finds she likes the limelight herself, and takes it a bit too far, in typical Becky Bloomwood fashion.The book's only flaw is that it's too long - over 400 pages, and though Becky has actually matured some, she still grates after about 300. There were too many subplots, some of which are not resolved by the end, so I can guarantee you another installment in the series.

"Andie Mitchell is a food blogger, and a pretty good one. Unfortunately, that skill doesn't translate well into book-writing (which I thought we'd learned already?).This book is not terrible. The beginning is painfully overwritten, with endless description - Mitchell has never met an adjective or adverb she didn't love. If you like food porn more than I do, you might tolerate it better, but either way, she settles down eventually into the story.The problem is, there's not much of a story. She had a childhood marred by her father's alcoholism and early death. She has a great brother and endlessly devoted mother. She used food to mask her pain and was very overweight for most of her life, but she was also prom queen and had lots of friends. She tried some diets that didn't work, but eventually lost the weight and then she takes you through an exhaustive run-down of her jobs since college.Maybe a Cheryl Strayed-level memoirist could have wrung more out of this story, and it definitely could have been an interesting personal essay, but as a book it's just okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA3E2CCSEE50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770433243#wasThisHelpful","R1WA3E2CCSEE50","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow I had initially gotten the impression that this book was upmarket women's fiction, like The Weird Sisters, or The Paris Wife: A Novel (Random House Reader's Circle). On the first page, I figured out that this was really just chick lit, so I revised my expectations, but this book still failed to be interesting.Allison has just moved back to her hometown with her son to give him a fresh start. Her husband died eleven years ago, so she finally figured it was time, I guess? Allison doesn't really have any problems: she's gorgeous, her parents are ridiculously supportive, her kid is great, and she promptly attracts a successful, attractive guy. Ostensibly her movement from grief back into life is the issue, but the tone of the book is fairly emotionless, so I never believed her grief was an actual issue, especially because it wasn't fresh.She becomes friends with Charlotte, who's shallow and unsympathetic when she's not wildly inconsistent. There's a manufactured crisis between the two of them, but it all works out.A lot of the issues with this book fall in the lack of demonstrating, the lack of ""showing."" There are few actual scenes, mostly just narration, so the emotional impact of anything that does happen to the characters is missing. There's also a lack of conflict - we're told Charlotte and her husband are having issues, but we never really see it, and he's so nice when he's not with her I mostly just felt bad for him that he had married her. We're told Charlotte's daughter is a problem, but we only see some mildly bratty behavior once, so I wasn't sure what the problem is. Everything interesting in the book either happened years ago or happens offstage.So ultimately, disappointing and bland for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEPPBESJOPO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419456#wasThisHelpful","R1AEPPBESJOPO6","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading other reviews on this makes me feel a little foolish, because I did not find this easy to use or assemble AT ALL, and I'm still fumbling with it as I go.Here's the core of it: if you want to make things like zucchini noodles to replace pasta, and are tired of dealing with a julienne peeler, buy this. It does what it says it will do, and cleverly.My first piece of advice: read the manual. The designers have set up an ingenious system that doesn't waste space - the blades are stored in a little compartment under the machine, the handle comes off and stores inside, the blade folds down and there's a little plastic cover for the whole thing (that I still haven't managed to put on right). Seriously, I have a thousand Cuisinart pieces rattling around the cabinet - those folks could learn from Paderno. But you will never figure out where all the little bits fold up and slide in and snap on by yourself, so read the manual.Side note on that: the manual said to put the vegetable on the round holder. Mine has a rectangular holder. The pictures at that step are useless.Which brings me to my second piece of advice: watch some videos. They made clear to me what the manual did not.My third piece of advice: experiment, and be prepared to waste some veggies in the process. I've been unable to get small vegetables (carrot, small squash) to work, but I have gotten larger-diameter veggies to work easily. However, I've found it works better if you cut the veggies in half (widthwise), otherwise keeping the pressure up is awkward. But this is good anyway, because otherwise you'd end up with too-long zoodles or curly fries.If you're more mechanically-minded than I am, maybe you'll find using this easier from the get-go. However, despite all my frustrations, I still far prefer it to my julienne peeler, so I'll keep wrestling and hope it continues to get easier over time.EDITED TO ADD: I just ran across this in my cabinet and realized I hadn't used it since about a week after I wrote this review. Clearly not a can't-live-without gadget.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ55N771M8Z3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AW3B5MM#wasThisHelpful","RZ55N771M8Z3","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We own the Omron wrist blood pressure monitor, but I found the readings I was getting with it were wildly different than the ones at the doctor's office. Was it just a case of white-coat hypertension, or was the wrist monitor really that off? I decided to give this one a try.For most folks, this monitor will be just fine. The arm band is large enough for 24"", and is easy to get on and off by yourself. It's noisy and not super-speedy, so you won't be able to use it in bed in the early morning without waking your partner, but it's easy to use. The display is big and clear enough for folks with limited vision, and it's easy to use - one button.I've used this regularly with the wrist monitor to see how they compare, and I can't say I've figured out a pattern yet. Sometimes the wrist is higher, sometimes this one is. They always agree on the pulse to within one or two beats, but the blood pressure, particularly the systolic, can vary between the two (taken at the same time or one right after the other) by as much as 20 points.I guess if all you need to know is whether your bp stays around the same level, this would be fine, but I can't say I've gotten any answer as far as accuracy is concerned, and given that both of the numbers I get are so different from the doctor's office, I'm not sure which one to believe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X31A8EW8JLJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQB4OU#wasThisHelpful","R1X31A8EW8JLJR","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to give this toy a negative review, because the cats love it so much. For that, it's 5 stars.BUT.There are three big problems:The first is that the feathers are not attached securely into the plastic at all, and fly off if you do anything bird-like.The second (related) is that the plastic part at the end of the feathers is cheap (as is the entire thing), and one good chomp from a cat breaks it easily.Both of those problems yield the same results: buying a LOT of replacement feathers. It's like a printer...they get you on the ink. We've tried taping and gluing the feathers in with no luck. If anyone has a better solution, we'd love to hear it.The third is unrelated but still kind of a pain - the string is literally that: string. So if you fling the bird around (the whole point), it gets tangled and knotted and it's very difficult to un-knot.And yet, we keep buying replacements. Why?

"I'm going to go ahead and give this two stars because when I put my food in, it was raw, and when I took it out, it was cooked. But other than that, this is not a great product.The timer hasn't worked right yet. Twice it's used some kind of new math, where even though it had been cooking for four-plus hours, the timer had only counted down 30-60 minutes. The first time this happened, I missed it entirely and only noticed what was happening when it started to smell burned (it was). The second, I checked at four hours and was able to turn it off, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a 'programmable' slow cooker, right?My Hamilton Beach 33969A Set 'n Forget Programmable Slow Cooker, 6-Quart has a lid that locks on and has rubber on the edge. Not so with this one. The metal edge of the top sits directly on the stoneware with no lock, which means the steam generated during cooking makes it rattle the whole time.

"Setup was a snap, and it seems to pair pretty well with my iPhone 5. Once the phone pairs with it — either if the unit is in range of your phone, or else if other local devices with Bluetooth “see” it and let your phone know — it will show up on a map.When my phone is the only nearby device the map isn’t too precise. It shows the phone and TrackR in the same general vicinity, but isn’t more accurate than, say, 20 feet or so. That makes sense; there really is no way to triangulate position with only two devices. It may be that you get a much more accurate map if there are other nearby devices helping your phone “look” for the TrackR. (So, if three people in a crowd all had Bluetooth on and set their devices to “discoverable”, it might be that you get a really accurate map that shows you exactly where the unit is relative to your device.)In any case, the accuracy of the map isn’t a huge deal because you can press a “sound alarm” button that makes the TrackR produce a loud-enough-to-hear-but-not-so-loud-that-you-want-to-smash-it chirp. If you lose your keys this alarm will definitely lead you to them.The catch is that this only works if the phone and TrackR are connected, and in my limited testing the unit seems to disconnect after a while. If I turn Bluetooth off, wait a few minutes, and then turn it back on my phone still finds the TrackR just fine; the same is true if I power down the phone and then turn it back on before too long. But if I keep the phone and the TrackR apart for a couple of days the devices “lose” each other. You have to reconnect, and you can’t do this without pressing the button on the TrackR. So it might help you find the car keys you misplaced a few hours ago, but not the camera bag you put somewhere last week.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKGXIVG3AN8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJLMLFW#wasThisHelpful","R2HKGXIVG3AN8Y","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I consider myself a Bohjalian fan, I haven't read his last few - didn't want to read about a plane crash, and not a big fan of historical novels (though I respect him as a writer for trying something different).The thing I loved about his early books was that I always felt I learned something new - midwifery, homeopathy, dowsing. He seems to have left that behind, but in this case it's not a disappointment.Emily, the narrator and main character, just has such a great voice. She's engaging from the beginning, even though the way she tells the story is somewhat disjointed, it's a slow burn, requiring you to put the pieces together, rather than confusing.The disadvantage of the strength of her voice is that the book is really, really dark, and Emily is not only caught in that darkness, but she is deeply broken and difficult to love. Topics the book deals with include: a nuclear disaster and multiple ensuing deaths, repeated and casual drug abuse, homelessness, cutting, rape, prostitution, child abandonment, crime, radiation sickness, mental illness, and alcoholism.It is so well written that it's very readable, but I also found it unrelentingly dark. If you're a sensitive reader, it might be too much.

"Though I've loved many of Sue Miller's books, I could hardly remember this one from day to day. I didn't have any problems putting it down and felt no particular urge to pick it back up, other than to write this review.The three main storylines - Frankie's readjustment to life after her aid work in Africa, the arsons, and Frankie's father's illness and dementia - never gelled into a smooth whole. The book's description makes much of the conflict between the year-round and summer residents, but that is overstating that quite a bit - the conflict doesn't really arise until fairly far into the book, and it's pretty toothless, despite its potential.I liked the romance between Bud and Frankie, but there weren't really any obstacles to it, so while it was the piece that kept me reading, it didn't really amp up the drama.I was about to say I'd keep reading Sue Miller, but then I remembered The Lake Shore Limited, which I couldn't even finish. I'm not sure. Her recent work isn't painful, but it's not fabulous either.

"From the outset, there's a very Secret History feel to this book, which is probably why I fell for it. The tone is dark and moody; though the setting is a charming Italian city, it's been overrun by students, and there's a sinister disconnectedness to the place immediately.Irish Taz has arrived for a prestigious study abroad program, though she's a mediocre student, and is swept quickly into a glamorous group of four girls: wealthy, sophisticated, attractive. Taz is described as somewhat bland, so she's flattered to be accepted by the group, and naive enough not to ask questions where she should. Taz's character is really the main flaw of the book - she's a weak person, but also not clearly drawn, so often it feels like she's acting out of character rather than going through an arc.The book is clearly inspired by the Amanda Knox case, but I far preferred it to Cartwheel, which I couldn't even finish. The fact that this is from the victim's perspective (not a spoiler - you learn she's dead in the first few pages) allows Crouch a lot of leeway.Speaking of the author, if you've read Crouch's other books, this is a huge departure, but it's more memorable than those were, too.I have some quibbles with the end, but I won't divulge them for fear of spoilers. And overall, I really enjoyed the book and didn't want to put it down when I had to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJQ29XS7D8OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374100365#wasThisHelpful","R3VJQ29XS7D8OS","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're a protein shake drinker, you've likely had the problem of thinking you've snapped the lid down only to shake it and end up with liquid all over your arm.This bottle offers an ingenious solution that made me very happy.

It's just a nice little safety feature that made me realize how annoying I find the pure snap closures.I was doubtful of the propeller-looking mixer, but I actually think it works better than the metal spheres in my other bottles.Re: color.

"On the one hand, I tend to believe that guidebooks are all fairly similar. On the other hand, once you get used to a certain label, it's hard to make changes.I like Rick Steves' advice, but the layout of his guidebooks bother me. The information is great, but the tall, thin format and the easy-to-tear paper, in addition to the lengthy explanations and descriptions can be a drag if you're on the go. (Ironically, I like to read those before I go, rather than having them with me on the ground.)This Lonely Plant Paris book is a more standard paperback size with heavier paper and lots of bright photos. Those are kind of a waste (who's going to be confused by whether or not they're looking at the Eiffel Tower?), but they look pretty.There's an introductory section with top sights, explanations of general cultural information in short, direct paragraphs, and pages in each section listing recommendations, so you can plan stops on the fly. The layout of the more detailed listings is by neighborhood, in standard guidebook format. Finally, there are a handful of less vital but often interesting chapters: day trips from the city, historical and cultural information, more cultural information (train stations! bike rental! public toilets!) and a short language primer.This is a good book for a brief visit with stops at the standard places (though they do have some fun recommendations that are not in every guidebook's top 10), with bonus points for the good and detailed cultural info.

That stays cold for a long time, but it's not flexible, and there's no way to hold it on, so I end up tying it around my elbow with a bandanna.I jumped at this product because the picture on the box makes it look as though it has some way to attach the pack when it's wrapped around a ""small"" area (I don't know what child they wrapped it around for the picture, by the way - it barely meets around my wrist). This is not the case. It's just a cold pack, and I ended up tying it around my elbow with the same bandanna.It takes about 2 hours to freeze initially, and 30 minutes to re-freeze, as promised.

"Salt Sugar Fat is an amazing and often depressing look at the food industry in America. The fact is, most of us aren't eating food, we're eating products. Michael Moss did extensive research, including visiting the laboratories where these companies (which seemed surprisingly open about their methods)create and design the products we call food, from Lunchables to soda to cereal.The authors of It Starts with Food: Discover the Whole30 and Change Your Life in Unexpected Ways talk about ""food with no brakes"", food products that are designed to appeal to our sense of taste and have no genuine ingredients that give us any signals of satiety, leading to overconsumption. Moss talks about how the food industry uses salt, sugar, and fat to create these foods without brakes, and how their marketing departments get them into our hands. I won't lie - reading it gave me some mouth cravings for sugary cereals, but when he talks about the number of scientists and the chemicals they use to make these products tasty and shelf-stable, it's hard to keep those cravings going.Though it was an interesting, often fascinating read, I'm giving it 3 stars for two reasons - first, it's too long. Salt, sugar, and fat each have their own section, but that's really unnecessary, as Moss is making the same points (and occasionally repeating the same anecdotes) about each one. Second, his nutrition science is behind the times - for instance, he talks in the fat section about the dangers of saturated fats, which is questionable, and ignores the real issue of the kinds of fats these companies use - highly processed, unnatural seed oils.If you're interested in nutrition, this book is totally worth a read, despite its flaws.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAD9E8BTMRVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069807#wasThisHelpful","RYAD9E8BTMRVS","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living Paleo for Dummies won't give you all the information you need, but I guess that's not really the point of the For Dummies books.

However, if you're unfamiliar or trying to find something good to share with someone who is, this is a good start.

Her writing has lots of personality, which shows through, but not in the annoyingly cutesy way that Dummies books can have (this is actually why I'd recommend this book over The Complete Idiot's Guide to Eating Paleo).There are a handful of included recipes, and while some of them will feel ""out there"" to people used to a Standard American Diet (Sesame Kale), lots of them will be a good intro - Spaghetti Squash & Meatballs, Leafy Tacos - to people who might think paleo is all about Flintstone-sized hunks of meat.

"This replaced our home office Epson WorkForce Pro WP-4530 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax, iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible (C11CB33201), which we really loved.The major bonuses to this as compared to the other were faster printing speed and two drawers for paper (we own our own business and do a lot of shipping, so a separate drawer for labels was a bonus). I didn't expect to love the touch-screen interface so much, but it is really wonderful - the only disadvantage is the onerous arrow key selection on the keyboard, but after you set up your wireless network, you'll rarely have to use it, so it's worth gritting your teeth through.Setup was a little bumpy, but I have the suspicion that was more to do with our network than the printer. The Epson scanner software isn't pretty, but it does a great job. And indeed this printer is fast and efficient, and thus far, low on ink usage. It also jams far less frequently than the previous Epson, which is a relief. It's small and low-profile for the amount it does, copies and scans and prints well (we don't use it for fax). Printing from iPhones and iPod and wireless printing also successful. Another new feature is Epson Connect, where you can email documents to your printer and they'll be waiting, all printed out, for you when you get back to it. This is a need I didn't know I had, but it's come in handy more than once.Overall, we're really happy with our 2nd Epson  - if you're in need of something slightly more than a home printer but not up to a laser, this is a great choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ONIOXUP9HMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091DPYDU#wasThisHelpful","R10ONIOXUP9HMG","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've never been to Hawaii and were feeling overwhelmed about which island(s) to visit and what to choose, so we picked up this Fodor's to help. Help it did: on flipping through the first time, there's a chart at the beginning laying out reasons to visit each island (Beaches, Nature, Sports) and then at the beginning of each island's section, a list of highlights.The book is divided by island, then by locations and activities. As with other Fodor's Guides, I'm always fond of the Fodor's Choice listings - starred listings that can take you to their recommended restaurant or hotel or activity. If you like to do lots of your own research, this fairly slender guide will really only be a beginning, but if, like me, you just want an overview, selections like that are great.I've never been big on photos in travel guides, but there are plenty here, and they're gorgeous (though, to be fair, they are photographs of some really gorgeous places), along with lots of maps and other illustrations (including charts of types of leis and fish you might see while snorkeling).The book's greatest strength for me was its breadth, as it showed us a little bit of everything (with a surprising amount of detail in certain places - the Big Island's restaurant listing is 16 pages long - 18, if you count the map). However, if you know which island you're going to, you'll want to get a guidebook specific to that island. Because our trip isn't until next year, I can't tell you yet how their listings measure up, but certainly for the overview we wanted, this was exactly right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F5WYL0G08424/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307929272#wasThisHelpful","R1F5WYL0G08424","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Though others have complained about the native software, we used it with Time Capsule, and it was truly plug-and-play.Cords are good length, all included, and the size was fine - it's the size of a large paperback book, the same as our other drives, with a nice unobtrusive design.Of course, the question with all hard drives is...how long will it last?

"I've never had a bamboo cutting board before, and if you haven't either, I recommend doing some research on caring for them. They will require oiling, you shouldn't use them for meat unless you're (a) willing to do some heavy disinfecting afterwards and (b) marking which side you've used for meat, and they have to be hand-washed and dried.However, if you want a board that will spare your knives and is made from a more sustainable material than wood, bamboo will do it, and this is a fine starter set.I was surprised how small the boards were (especially the smallest one), but they've turned out to be just fine. The smallest one is surprisingly handy for tasks like mincing garlic or chopping parsley, and I find myself reaching for it repeatedly.Frankly, I'm just not likely to take care of these the way they're meant to be (and I use ceramic knives, so that's not an issue), so I can't say I'm crazy about them, but they're a nice exposure without spending an enormous amount of money for a huge, heavy bamboo board at a pricy kitchenware shop.Edited to add: The longer I've had these, the less I use them. The extra steps in caring for them mean I'd just rather use my dishwasher-safe ones. What can I say? We're lazy cooks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYFHVWK6EJM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HPSP5M#wasThisHelpful","R3VYFHVWK6EJM2","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Assembled this puzzle tonight with the 4-year old. This definitely requires adult assistance.It comes with a half-sphere to build the halves of the ball on. The pieces are a good large size for little fingers, and they are numbered, so the adult can help locate the piece and the child can figure out where it goes (that's really the only educational part - the spacial relations present in any puzzle). They snap together tightly and the ball, once assembled, is sturdy.Love that you can keep things in it. He's snuggling with it now - blanky in one hand, ball in the other.As a bonus, I also got an age-appropriate similar puzzle from the same company for the 8-year old. That one was much tougher - the numbers are hard to read, smaller pieces are difficult to snap together, overall just much more complex. We got about a quarter of that done in the time it took to complete this one. Honestly, I'd rather have gotten two of these - she could have done it more independently but it would have been quicker and less frustrating.However, this one is a thumbs-up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1V7X7TXB6G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ROJI10#wasThisHelpful","R3T1V7X7TXB6G9","A2TOFNA3TWMOJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TOFNA3TWMOJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok I've had this a few days now and I really liked it. There are a few things I would have liked different but I liked it.  This was great with writing reminders and posting for certain things that I need around the house.  As for writing, it writes great and it comes out bold and bright. Now erasing it, for me you could still see the last content written and when I erase it with a slightly damped clothed writing on the paper the writing isn't the same. Apart from that I still liked it a lot, not in love with it but like it.

The problem, it came apart after 6 months and I was not able to replace screw because it wasn't easily sold. I thought this stepper would have been cheap and would feel funny without an handle. But I have to say, it is firm and works very very well. You definitely feel the burn and your legs are getting a good workout.

"VIEW MY PHOTO WITH REVIEW BECAUSE THIS LITERALLY WORKS. I know how it is to go over others reviews and debate if you should get the product. I put on the waist trainer for 10 minutes while using my stepper. I wasn't sweating I just had a hint of sweat over my body after 10 minutes, also I didn't feel like I was sweating at my mid section where my trainer was. However, after the 10 minutes and not feeling as sweaty I took of the trainer, WHOA, WOW & OMG, there was so much sweat. I was shocked I ran out my room to show my brother and I said to him this accumulated after 10 minutes it was a lot and I told him that while working out I didn't feel like I was sweating at my mid section because the trainer was firmly held in place and did not move. It works and I would invest. I don't know about longevity but if you re debating I say go for it.P.S make sure you are aware of the inches before purchasing. I measured my waist before purchasing.k****UPDATE 4x using it: ****F.Y.I I know it's gross so SORRY but I am showing a photo of the trainer with sweat, this is just after walking my dog and doing 10 minutes of jogging combined. That is actual sweat not water and with all that sweat you aren't feeling it underneath trainer, the trainer stays in place and you feel dry not gross or it feels like it's sliding off. This trainer works best believe, I hope this help with deciding purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCU9VRAS04C4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R84J2PK#wasThisHelpful","RCU9VRAS04C4C","A2NUHWMHA9XNKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Length: 99 pagesStyle: Erotica RomanceStory: GOODIntimacy level: GOODEnjoyment: FAIRLY GOODSeries: N/APrice: $2.99 / $3.99The GoodJames is an escort who has been in the business for ten years. This might sound off putting but it went well with James' character. He was mysterious, sexy and commanding. I still saw him as a business man of sorts with the use of a deadly weapon, his body. Haley was your typical shy, virginal, naive heroine. When James and Haley connected, it very much made my read very much enjoyable. Their chemistry was fitting and gave the reader something to look forward to. Even though Haley seem virginal and naive, it didn't hinder my read or enjoyment as the plot of the story unfolds. It was interesting to read how James balances his escort life while perusing Haley.The BadThis was a story I really enjoyed, but it was a quick read with a simplistic storyline, but with a creative concept. This to me is not bad nor good, but satisfactory. So if you are seeking an in-depth ongoing story this isn't it. If you are seeking quick likable enjoyment then this is for you.OverallA good read, likable characters and an escort service I personally wouldn't mind having a go at. I really did enjoy James and Haley, however, I do hope the author writes more on the other characters in the story. The other escorts have peeked my curiosity especially Eliza, as well as Haley's best friend. All these characters made the book interesting and I look forward to more of the author's work as I am always a fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJI1V4V1CWFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TMW2OTM#wasThisHelpful","R2JJI1V4V1CWFT","A2NUHWMHA9XNKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Retseliney Best Organic Shea Sugar Scrub for Hand & Body, Anti Aging Moisturizer for Skin, Hydration Exfoliant Cream, Natural Exfoliator with Vitamin E, Coconut Oil & Shea ButterSugar scrubs have exploded on the market, and for good reason. These exfoliates are so beneficial to your skin, especially during the Fall and Winder month when skin is the driest and often most vulnerable. I have very dry and dull looking skin during the Winter and I apply lotions and creams more often, however that glow sees to be missing.The simple process of exfoliation is the gradual removal of the top layer dead skin cells. Using a sugar scrub for exfoliation is great for rubbing against your skin where the friction creates the exfoliation.The gentle abrasion of the scrub also removes damaged skin cells in addition to opening up clogged pores. Exfoliation also helps to prevent acne, blackheads, whiteheads, breakouts and other skin blemishes.Sugar scrubs are gentler on the skin, and dissolve more easily in hot water. The granules are round and therefore will not scrape or cut  the skin. The circular motion can improve circulation and firm up the skin as well.I love it as a much healthier option for sensitive skin types and the only choice for the face.Sugar scrubs are less drying and because of the smaller, finer granules, is suitable for nearly all skin types and conditions. The Reteseliney formula includes Shea butter, sunflower seed oil and coconut oil, all ingredients to help moisturize as you cleanse.**Received for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased  review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJB1TIJ7SWUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014B47FX0#wasThisHelpful","R3HJB1TIJ7SWUZ","A1VAL3GKU9UXKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VAL3GKU9UXKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mahogany and Rosewood 21 Inch Concert Ukulele with Strap Pins, Includes High End Gig Bag with Backpack Style StrapsMusic has a way of creating a relaxing atmosphere regardless of its genre. I come from a family of people who learned how to play several instruments each and I struggled with having the patience and confidence to feel like I was going to be good enough.Learning how to play Uekele has awakened a new sense of accomplishment for me. I was so excited when I placed the order when my shipment arrived, I opened the box and felt like a kid at Christmas. My face lit up with excitement and nervousness all at the same time.To ever have held one before, it was impressive to see how smooth, intricately detailed and well put together this one was. Having seen and held a few Guitars, you can appreciate high quality craftsmanship.The size of the Ukulele is small so the process of holding and playing it was not at all intimidating. As a matter of fact, although never holding one in my life, there was a sense of comfort and familiarity.I assumed there would only be a box to store the Ukulele in and would later have to purchase a case, but was relieved to find there was a padded case with an optional hand strap or could be work like a backpack. Both pieces were surprisingly lightweight and could be easily carried for long periods of time.Some other interesting features of the Ukulele:>21 inches long Soprano>the neck is made of Mahogany and the fingerboard of Rosewood>strap pins are already included, just need to purchase a strap separately>there is a model number to identify authenticity of the manufacturer>seamless design; no lumps, bumps, warping, imperfections or splintersFeatures of the carrying case:>has adjustable padded fabric and nylon straps>includes a side handle for option hand transport>has a padded internal polyester lining>included a smaller exterior pocket for extras>zippered compartment opens completely for fuss free loading and unloadingAs a beginner, this is one great instrument and wiht proper care, will last a very long time.I will have to learn how to properly tune the Ukulele for optimum sound but a small price to pay for th enjoyment I can get out of it for myself and hopefully my children as well.Another fun chapter in my life of the many things I want to try. Learning how to play a musical instrument with no pressure, just good fun, was one of them.

"Oh my this is a great, works fantastic set of grinders that look pretty too!! The adjustment wheel makes it easy for me to choose the exact right grind for the spice I'm using because-- THESE ARE NOT Just For S&P! Any spice I choose will easily fit inside and come out the bottom. The lids keep them clean. The clear glass lets me see what's inside (I could write on them with dry erase or chalk pen if I wanted and it would clean up too) they are great enough for a gift too. They are small enough to use a lot but large enough not to have to fill constantly too.  They really do work fast and easy with no over torque in my hands.

"These are the softest washcloths ever! If using for a baby or for your own face, you won't be disappointed!  They are bigger than my hand so great size too. This is a large set so a great gift for a shower too. I confess that I did get some to use to remove makeup and they are wonderful.

"This kit is great! These are stainless steel and sturdy too. There are multiple sizes for removing any size blemish I have-- up against my nose or anywhere else. I sometimes get them in my back and these work great for that also. The 5 different sizes work great and there is a poker to help the stubborn blemish pop. They can sterilize with alcohol easily so that the bacteria isn't passed along and cleaning them is effective. I find these do less damage to my skin because I don't push and squeeze as much, just the area right around the blemish or blackheads and then it lifts out the blockage from the clogged pores. The case is great too- keeps them all in one place with a zipper case. I'm can put it into my makeup case or handbag for travel without them getting lost.

I've only had it for 2 nights and already I find myself less bloated and getting very ""regular"" if you catch my meaning. But not so much that I'm finding myself attached to the bathroom. I drink before bed and find no interruptions not my sleep.  Since this is a loose tea I simply put it into my tea ball and steep for my desired time 5-10 mins or less and it does the trick.

"This Tushi watch is so much more than a heart rate monitor-- A KCal counter (calories) , pedometer, heart rate and height and weight is put into it as well AND  a watch. There are I'm sure things my husband hasn't yet figured out. He's been using it for a few days now and compared it to the app on his phone and our treadmill and let me just tell you this IS dead on accurate! Ok look at all of my pictures-- it's very nice! Oh I forgot there's a stop watch feature too! This came with the battery installed and working right out of the box too. Even a great gift (holidays coming or birthday) it comes in I nicely packed box too. The buttons are easily accessible on the sides but just hidden enough to not push accidentally. The various modes are very easy to navigate through. Believe me- if my husband who gets very frustrated can do it, so can you. The instructions are in English and they send an extra copy before it arrives via email AND they send a YouTube video also and that's a huge help-- so watch it! The band is fully adjustable for a perfect fit on my husbands wrist. It doesn't pull his hair or make him sweat.  This can be worn under or over depending on how he likes the face (top of wrist or inside). Very well built, in fact this rivals The  more expensive "" popular "" ones but I didn't have to pay that price. It's very much worth the price and is a great every day watch- but more!

"This is the 62nd book in Kagero's Monographs series and volume II (of 2) devoted to the Ar 234. It is an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", 120 page, square bound card cover. There are three unbound fold outs included so, as always, if buying second hand make sure these are included.The book breaks down similarly to volume I, the previous volume in this series. The first 30 pages are devoted to a brief service history of the aircraft supported by numerous but not always the best quality black and white photos. There follows 24 pages of drawings reproduced from contemporary factory documentation. These are certainly not without interest but the German captions are not translated forcing the non-German speaking reader to online translation services for enlightenment. One and a quarter of the unbound foldouts also feature factory drawings.There follows two pages of modern line drawings of the Ar 234C-3 in 1/72nd scale. There are seven views - the normal six and a profile with the wing removed to show the entire, unobscured fuselage. One and a half of the unbound foldouts feature the same drawings in the larger 1/48th and 1/32nd scales. The final quarter of a foldout shows some detailed drawings by Brian Hygate of the Ar 234B including inboard profiles and many details.The book concludes with 64 pages (including rear cover) of high quality computer graphics of both the Ar 234B and Ar 234C. Exterior features are extensively covered.As was the case for volume I everything *except* for the modern line drawings and the computer graphics appeared in the first (one volume) edition of this book, Monograph 33 from 2007, by the same author. The present book also reproduces the black and white photos at a somewhat larger size in many cases. The cover painting is new as well. The earlier (2007 edition) also included some ""masking foil"" that is not included here.In conclusion, the drawings and graphics represent a substantial upgrade in value for my money and completely justifies buying both volumes of the new edition even if one has the first one. Way too often Kagero tries to get readers to double dip, that is, buy the same material twice with little to no new material. This time around they did it the right way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUXP0ZSRRYCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8364596659#wasThisHelpful","RQUXP0ZSRRYCI","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 61st book in Kagero's simply named ""Monographs"" series. It is a 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"" square bound, 128 page card cover. There are also 2 unbound foldouts so if buying second hand make sure to ask if these are included.The book has several distinct sections. The first 50 pages are a design and development history of the Ar 234 up to and including the Ar 234C series. It is supported by numerous black and white photos including many of several iterations of a wooden mock up of the aircraft. It is followed by two pages of 1/72nd line drawings of the Ar 234B-2 in seven views, the traditional six views and a seventh profile with wing and engines omitted to give an uninterrupted fuselage. These drawings are reproduced in 1/48th and 1/32nd scales on the unbound foldouts.Then we come to the major contribution of this book - the 66 pages of high quality computer graphics. The concentration is heavily on the cockpit and the landing gear and I doubt that any reader will not learn more about the aircraft after examining these pages.The book concludes with four pages of color photographs of a preserved aircraft and 5 pages (including rear cover) of color profiles.All is excellently done. It remains to compare the contents of the present book with a previous volume in the Monographs series devoted to this aircraft. This was Monograph 33 by the same author. Everything in the present book appears in the previous book *except* the computer graphics and the line drawings. The black and white photos are reproduced in a larger size than in the previous book as well. Thus the present book constitutes (along with volume 2) a considerable upgrade to the previous book. The cover painting is completely new and the masking foil included in the previous volume is not included here.All in all, highly recommended whether one owns the previous book or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZ4WO1H5TNJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8364596349#wasThisHelpful","R2EZ4WO1H5TNJK","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 100th title in publisher Steve Ginter's long running Naval Fighters series. It is an 8-1/2"" x 11"", 128 page, square bound card cover. Unusually, for a Ginter title there is a fair amount of color to be found between the covers. Also, unusually for a Ginter title this is not a very good book.The following is speculation but I'm trying to be as generous as I can to the authors and publisher. The book has the feel of a fragment of a book that was hastily padded out and published after the death of one of the authors (Riley). As other reviewers have noted precious little of the book seems to deal with the nominal subject of the book. A very large percentage is nothing more than padding. I think Ginter published the book as a favor to the authors but I'm not sure he did them much of a favor.The silver lining of the book is the color content in the form of a few pages of color photos and some specially commissioned color profiles (I suspect by the authors and not the publisher). The attractive cover painting is also on the credit side of the ledger.I think the more appropriate way to publish this material would have been a normal book on, say, the Vought Corsair biplanes with the the Blue Goose material incorporated and Riley listed as co-author.In short, I can't recommend the book to any but the most diehard Naval Fighters completist. I certainly would not have bought the book if it wasn't in the Naval Fighters series. Again, I'm speculating but if publisher Ginter was trying to be a nice guy I don't think he quite pulled it off.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6ZGOUOYLC4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989258386#wasThisHelpful","R3F6ZGOUOYLC4N","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marvel has these omnibuses down to a science now. As products they are really quite impressive. Physically, the book is about 11-1/4"" tall, 7-3/4"" wide, and about 2-1/4"" thick. It has1176 pages. It is hardbound with decorated boards. The dustjacket front and spine are identical to the corresponding covers but the rear jacket cover has a montage of individual issue covers while the back cover proper depicts the werewolf battling Moon Knight. The interior pages are of a thin coated stock. This makes such a large book more manageable at the price of some opacity. The see through is minimal and I'll take the thinner stock any day. The binding is sewn so the book will stay open on any page with little or no effort. The book is hefty; I would guess about 5 pounds. It is probably best read with it open on a desk or table although I did not have any problems reading it while lying on my side with the book beside me on the bed. Reading it while on your back is probably out of the question, though.The content is equally impressive. All comic books make some demands on the reader as far as the willing suspension of disbelief goes but this one more than most. I have no problem with accepting that a man can turn into a werewolf. I do have some issues with the way that condition is handled in the book, though. Russell constantly fears he will harm someone as a werewolf but acts in such a manner that makes that a virtual certainty. He is constantly taken by surprise that there is a full moon on a given night. One would think that a werewolf would be a virtual walking almanac who could quote the rising and setting of the moon for months in advance. His father seems to have dealt with the problem of lycanthropy for years in a very capable manner; Russell just seems helpless. The relative power of the werewolf is also dialed up and down as required by the plot as well. Sometimes one man is more than he can handle; at other times he holds his own against demigods.But once you accept that Jack Russell is only going to be as intelligent and powerful as the plot demands we have some excellent stories. Heroes are typically only as good as the villains they face and the werewolf has quite the rogues gallery built up by series end. The supporting cast is excellent as well. The werewolf had a fair amount of crossovers and guest appearances with the various Marvel characters. Spider-Man, Dracula, Morbius, the Monster of Frankenstein, Moon Knight (his first appearance), and Iron Man all make appearances.The book is entirely self contained; this was before the company wide crossover made that virtually impossible. There is an unresolved subplot at the very end. Typically these get resolved in other titles after a book is cancelled but I don't know whether this one ever was.The artwork is generally excellent throughout. Most people prefer Mike Ploog but I think Don Perlin is the definitive werewolf artist. Doug Moench is unquestionably the best writer but the others are fine as well.Extras are fairly generous but nothing really special. There is a letter page announcement of series cancellation, art from the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe series (but not the text), unused covers, original art (four to a page unfortunately), and a series of cover art from various previous werewolf collections.All in all, outstanding value and great entertainment. Jack Russell is a very likable hero, if not too bright on occasion. The first person narrative style really works well and sucks the reader right in. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3YLWJPFVCZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078519908X#wasThisHelpful","RT3YLWJPFVCZP","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 100th Warpaint book in a series that goes back at least 25 years in its current incarnation (there were previous short lived Warpaint series). It's hard to be certain as Warpaint books have never carried ISBNs or copyright dates. The book is an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", 72 page, square bound card cover. In addition to the 72 numbered pages there is a bound foldout that is equivalent to 4 additional pages. The author is Charles Stafrace who has written a number of excellent Warpaints in the series' later years. This book is well up to Stafrace's normal high standards.The subject of the book is one of those aircraft that, despite being built in large numbers and having served with many operators, has been neglected by authors and publishers because it saw little or no combat. This book goes some ways in making up for that neglect.Despite the book's title coverage is fairly complete of all the Republic swept wing jets. The XF-91, XF-84H, XF-84J, and RF-84K models are all covered as well.The book is well organized. The background, design, and development history is covered in more detail than is normal in a Warpaint book. The problems encountered during development are discussed in some detail as well. The rather brief service history in the USAF is detailed as well as service in the Air National Guard and it's association the the Thunderbirds aerobatic team. Then, in alphabetical order, the service history of the aircraft with the various US allies is covered. Especially interesting are the activities of French F-84Fs and RF-84Fs during the Suez crisis (where they flew in Israeli markings). This was the only shooting war the aircraft managed to get into although we also learn that F-84Fs in Turkish service shot down Iraqi intruders and that Greece came close to ordering strikes during the war over Cyprus.The text is well supported as always by many photographs with a fair proportion being in color. There are 7-1/2 pages of color profiles including the inside front and rear covers, 4 pages of high quality line drawings on the bound foldout, 21 tables (the majority taken up with serial number matches with the various operators), and 4 pages of detailed close-up photos in the ""In Detail"" section.This book is highly recommended. It is a worthy 100th book in the series and I hope there is a straight wing F-84 Thunderjet follow-up in the works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVUPQX8NTYQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RGWDT8#wasThisHelpful","RPVUPQX8NTYQH","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 35th (No. 16035) book in Kagero's Super Drawings in 3D series. It is published in the familiar format of an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", stapled card cover with 68 interior pages although the page numbering includes the card covers which is standard for this series.The subject is a welcome one, a dreadnought type battleship built in a nation which would shortly no longer exist, Austria-Hungary. The computer graphics, as always, are superbly done and give the reader an excellent impression of the exterior of the ship. There are a few features present which I have not seen on the ships in other volumes in this series. The openings where the main armament emerges from the turrets are closed off by metal panels which have to be opened for the guns to elevate. These are unfortunately always shown opened. There are also vent doors in the interiors of the funnels. I would have liked more detail here as well. There are also extensive views of the ship with the torpedo nets deployed.But this book has more than a few weaknesses as well. The text has never been a great selling point of these books but this book was especially lacking in this area. There was no discussion at all of the design or technical details of the ship. There is a service history of sorts but it is padded out with exposition about the political problems of the country which ultimately led to its partition. The translation is more than a little dodgy as well. There is the sentence ""The Szent Istvan survived almost unscathed"" followed by an account of her sinking! I think the authors were going for ""The Szent Istvan almost survived unscathed"". The captions are generally informative but rather brief. The constant use of ""headlights"" when ""searchlights"" was meant was annoying. The torpedo battery also gets short shrift, being below the waterline. Only the stern tube is mentioned in the captions. The covers for the side tubes are visible but not mentioned; I couldn't make out the bow tube at all.The worst failing was the lack of the usual unbound foldout  with conventional line drawings. All the reader gets is a full page advertisement for the volume in Kagero's Top Drawings series for this ship. I hope that this does not become the norm for this series.In conclusion, the book can be highly recommended on the computer graphics alone but if the conventional line drawings are important to you you may have to buy another book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5G69EPIFRAXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8364596640#wasThisHelpful","R5G69EPIFRAXV","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 60th book (No. 3060) in Kagero's Monographs series. The book is an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", square bound, 144 page card cover. The book is devoted to the Dornier Do 17/Do 215, one of three bombers the Luftwaffe started WWII with and the only one of the three that didn't serve to war's end.The book breaks down into three parts. The first 100 pages are devoted to the background, design, development, and service history of the aircraft. The next 32 pages feature very high quality line drawings primarily in 1/72nd scale but with some fittings drawn bigger. There are a few pages of drawings in 1/96th scale detailing external differences between models. Color profiles and a few plans take up the remainder of the book and the rear cover.All is excellent and well worth the asking price but I can only award three stars because of Kagero's occasional practice of double dipping (enticing the consumer to buy the same material twice) as in this case.Seven years ago Kagero published a Do17/Do 215 book in this same series (it was number 39) with the same author. Are there major differences, justifying a new volume in the series? Sadly, no.The differences are minor. There is a new cover painting. The current volume does not have the masking foil the original did. The text in the current volume is spread over 100 pages instead of the 92 of the original. This permits some additional photos to be added and in fact some photos have been reproduced at a smaller size to squeeze in some more. The drawings are identical but in the current book the Polish captions have been removed leaving only English. The are three additional pages of color profiles and as with the drawings the Polish captions have been removed.In conclusion, I can only recommend this book if one doesn't already own the original in which case I highly recommend it. If one does own the original there is little point beyond obsessive completism (which I succumb to more often than I would like) to get this newer edition.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KP244JDU0Z3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8364596330#wasThisHelpful","R3KP244JDU0Z3Y","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is the 99th in Steve Ginter's long running (over 30 years) Naval Fighters series. This one, I believe, is the biggest yet, coming in at 272 interior pages in a square bound 8-1/2"" x 11"" card cover. It is part 2 in the AD/A-1 Skyraider sub-series with at least one more volume to come. Color, as nearly always in a Ginter publication, is restricted to the front and rear covers.Whenever you see the word ""squadrons"" in the title of a Ginter book you can be certain that Ginter himself wrote it. Squadron histories are a Ginter forte. He has a standard format which presents a lot of information with a minimum of text. He briefly describes the history of the unit prior to receiving Skyraiders. It is interesting to note how few squadrons in this book go back to the '20s or '30s. He follows with models and numbers of aircraft in inventory, commanding officers, parent group or wing, deployments, and if applicable, combat history in Korea and Vietnam. He lists losses with pilots and other crew identified and memorable actions are detailed often in first person accounts. There are black and white photos of aircraft in the squadron's markings in almost every case. Almost all the photos are of full aircraft but one does see a lot detail like dive brakes opened in in flight photos. Almost every unit has a photo of a patch or insignia again in black and white.The book's glaring weakness is the paucity of color. The '50s and '60s were periods of colorful markings for Navy aircraft and black and white photos just can't do them justice no matter how often were told that the fin tip was green or the stripe was yellow outlined in black. The front and rear covers are just not enough. Can't we get just one 16 page signature of color photos in the interior? Specially commissioned color profiles would also be great.There are also a few typos throughout the book. The most glaring is a confusing reference to a (non-existent) ""EA-1B"". From context it is fairly easy to tell that ""E-1B"" (a non-Skyraider) was meant.In summary, there is great value here but the retail price is great as well. We all know what we can expect from a Ginter book these days. This one delivered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRMWX9XE9LQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098925836X#wasThisHelpful","R2LRMWX9XE9LQI","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the 99th in the long running Warpaint series. How long running is difficult to ascertain; Warpaint titles do not carry ISBNs or copyright dates. This book is typical of the breed. It's an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"" stapled card cover with 48 interior pages. The card covers, both interior and exterior, are also pressed into service.Not a great many books have been devoted to the F3H/F-3. The only other one I possess is the Ginter Naval Fighters title of some years ago although I am anxious to take a look at the new all digital Detail & Scale offering of this aircraft. The present book is very well written giving equal weight to the development and description on the one hand and service history on the other. The development was complicated by the problems plaguing the Westinghouse J40 engine but the Allison J71 replacement was by no means trouble free. The service history was in contrast fairly straightforward with only one operator, the US Navy, not even Marine Corps or Naval Reserve service. This gives plenty of room for some welcome pilots perspective.The text is supported by numerous photographs, a great many in color. The are also 7 pages of color profiles, 2 pages of detailed line drawings at 1/72nd scale, and 4 tables (specifications, production, units, and kits/decals/accessories).There is little to complain about. A fair number of photos are spread across the fold but this is not as bad for a stapled book as for a square bound book. The line drawings and color profiles are all devoted to the -2 version but this is understandable as the only version to see service.Highly recommended.

"It's an amazing thing watching TV shows you haven't seen in a half century. You keep saying things like ""This is the one where they use the minisub's canopy as a shield!"" or ""This is the episode where they point the cameras at each other so they can't be watched!"" or ""This is the one where this thing is growing out of control through the sub!"" as memories from long ago bubble to the surface.This show had all the problems that shows of that era shared. Budgets were low. Scripts varied widely in quality. Nothing carries over from previous episodes; it's as if every episode is a standalone. Indeed, later shows contradicted earlier ones on key points. Character development was virtually nonexistent.But the show had one great strength; the actors, whether cast or guests, never phoned it in. They squeezed what they could out of the script. Richard Basehart is particularly impressive in this regard; the material may be weak but he gives it all he has. David Hedison is not in the same league as Basehart in the talent department but he's still quite good. The other cast members don't get a lot of chances to shine but they never drag the show down either.The guests in this first season were a particularly impressive lot. Many familiar names although some were not so familiar at the time like Carroll O'Conner and Robert Duvall. I also was surprised how effective Werner Klemperer was in a dramatic, villainous role. I think he could have made an effective Blofeld in a James Bond movie had he not become typecast in his later Colonel Klink role.I really enjoyed watching these shows again but I have to admit the attraction was mostly but by no means completely nostalgia. I couldn't really recommend it to others who don't have a particular fondness for 1960s television. Adults will find it too unsophisticated for the most part and children will find it too dated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGFILXFBRR71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MVI8HO#wasThisHelpful","R1HGFILXFBRR71","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book has a lot of the features of previous volumes of the series. It has high production values throughout. It has a wonderful biographical feature on artist John Prentice supported by a good selection of non-Kirby work and photographs. It also has some great Kirby story arcs in the first half of the book. The first story has Honey Dorian in a very critical undercover role. The second (although rather short) features Kirby's nemesis, the Mangler, whose appearances are always welcome. The next two, while not as memorable, are good as well.The last four, however, while not without interest, seem to be non-Kirbyish somehow. The fifth story, Between Haven and Hell, has a somewhat absurd plot that is more reminiscent of the Phantom than Rip Kirby. The next, For Lack of Elise, has no real villain. The worst of the lot, Living in Harmony, doesn't involve crime, has an absurd plot, and wouldn't be out of place on the Twilight Zone. There is some recovery in the last story, The Packer Expedition, but even here Kirby is more of an action hero than detective and does nothing to catch the villain.Recommended despite reservations. Let's hope in the next volume we get some more Mangler and some Pagan Lee.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHN1ZCUTAJ8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613777108#wasThisHelpful","R3VHN1ZCUTAJ8X","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 21st book (No. 16021) in Kagero's ""Super Drawings in 3D"" series is a stapled card cover of European A4 size (8-1/4"" x 11-3/4""). There are 68 internal pages but the page numbering includes the card covers for obscure reasons. There is an unbound foldout included which has conventional 5 view line drawings in both 1/350th and 1/700th scales on one side and a large perspective drawing and various fittings in various scales on the other. As always make sure this is included if buying secondhand.There is a brief development history as usual. This is fairly adequate and correctly credits developments in fire control as the reason for the type's appearance. However, I think it confuses the later development of director control with earlier developments. It also doesn't mention the reversal of accommodations from the standard of crew forward and officers aft that this ship pioneered (unsuccessfully).The bulk of the book is devoted to the outstanding CAD drawings of the ship. These drawings depict the external details of the ship as it appeared when entering service in 1907. I believe this is the first book in the series to depict torpedo nets. These are shown in both the deployed and stowed conditions. Also interesting is the fairly austere rig of ships of this era before various electronics started to dominate. The extensive number of boats is also shown to good advantage. There is also the lack of antiaircraft armament and the the interesting disposition of the large number of anti-torpedo boat 12-pounders. On the other hand the locations of the broadside torpedo tubes cannot be found on the drawings.The captions can only be considered barely adequate. Lots of interesting features go unremarked despite room for lengthier captions.Highly recommended despite these quibbles. This series is all about eye candy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBB0YD19ECORJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8362878681#wasThisHelpful","RBB0YD19ECORJ","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 33rd book (No. 6133) in MMP's long running ""Yellow Series"". Uniform with others in the series, the book is a 6-1/2"" x 9"" (European B5) sized, square bound card cover of 128 pages. Unusually, there are no unbound foldouts but there is a bound foldout, equivalent to 8 additional pages. There is color throughout in addition to a colorized photo on the cover.The author this time is Robert Michulec who will be familiar to readers of books from AJ Press, but not perhaps to readers of books from MMP. He wrote a 6 volume work on the Bf 109 for AJ Press (in Polish, condensed to 3 volumes in a rather rough English translation). Interestingly, at AJ Press the aircraft was referred to the Me 109 and Michulec defended that usage. Here, it's back to the conventional usage of Bf 109.The book is divided into three parts. First, there is an excellent design and development history which is excellently supported by black and white photographs. This covers all aspects of the Bf 109F, including the various subtypes and Rustzatz and Rustzustand modifications, tropical and GM 1-boosted versions, research efforts, production details, and more. There are also plenty of line drawings but all in 1/48th scale (the cover blurb about 3 scales shown on the Amazon cover shot does not appear on the actual product). In addition, there are some computer generated CAD drawings of the various cowlings and the tropical modification. There is also a color cockpit drawing on the foldout which appeared in the author's AJ Press books. It is of high quality but lacks the key identifying the various features.The second part of the book contains the color profiles, some with plan views. This section is about 25 pages long. It is supplemented by a gigantic color profile that stretches across 4 pages on one side of the foldout. All appears to be of excellent quality.The third part consists of close up photographs of surviving examples. These are supplemented not only by drawings from the contemporary technical literature but by more CAD drawings. There are also some period black and white photographs.Highly recommended. You can't have too many books about the Bf 109. Indeed, the appetite for books about any German aircraft of this period seems to be insatiable. I hope there are plans for Michulec to produce books about other Bf 109 versions. The E and G models were covered in the earliest books in this series but could use a thorough makeover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15J4CO5DW2XX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8361421750#wasThisHelpful","R15J4CO5DW2XX4","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The plot of this short story is really basic; it has been featured in comic books for the better part of a century and shows little sign of losing its appeal. Two superheroes arrive to fight the same menace. Do to a misunderstanding they wind up fighting each other. They eventually make up and finally defeat the menace by working as a team. And Riordan pulls it off quite nicely.The two superheroes are Percy Jackson and Carter Kane from different Riordan series. The story is told in first person from Carter's point of view but to compensate Percy, being older, comes across as somewhat more powerful and wiser although not by much. Riordan is clearly using this tale to test the waters of a future book or series. The sequel hooks are sharp and in plain sight.Fans of either or both Jackson and Kane will want to read this and the flexibility of electronic publishing makes it a snap to get a short story like this into the hands of a lot of readers. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7ZVGZ73KGHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJ05D6U#wasThisHelpful","RR7ZVGZ73KGHV","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago I read an omnibus volume collecting the first three Jacqueline Kirby mysteries. I enjoyed that volume so much that I made a mental note to pick up the fourth (and, unfortunately, last) Kirby novel when my reading schedule permitted. That time finally came and I am happy to report that the book does not disappoint.Like many of Peters' books this one can be enjoyed on a number of levels. As a well plotted mystery it has enough plot twists and red herrings to satisfy most mystery lovers and only in a few instances is plausibility ever  in question. It also works as humor; the author clearly was having a good time writing this. It's also an expose of sorts, exposing the unpleasant side of the publishing business. And given that it revolves around the sequel to a famous novel one wonders if there was a not a bit of autobiographical material mixed in. One also wonders how much the fuss surrounding the sequel to Gone with the Wind influenced the book? Was Peters ever in the running for that plum gig?In any event the book is highly recommended. One doesn't really need to read the previous Kirby books to enjoy this one. It is a sequel of sorts to the previous ""Die for Love"" but the connection is fairly tenuous.The Kindle edition is perfectly formatted. One annoyance that can't be blamed on Kindle formatting was the use, several times, of ""shouldn't of"". English teachers worldwide must have shaken their heads wearily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSLCF00IAPNC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH3DBRM#wasThisHelpful","RSLCF00IAPNC3","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a strange read for me and not because of the subject material. Any well researched book about haunted places (and this book is well researched) is going to have to deal with two narrative threads - what is believed and what is fact. Author Stollznow does not distinguish between the two very effectively. Her approach is very strange. Each chapter begins as if this is a book pulled off the occult shelf of the bookstore. Supernatural and paranormal claims, legend, rumor, and gossip, along with some actual fact, are presented in a matter of fact manner with no hint that the author has the slightest doubt about what she is relating. Then, at some point in the chapter, with no change of tone, the author begins to dole out the results of her research which effectively demolishes what she had related previously.I found this approach very off-putting and confusing. If it was intentional I can only say that it didn't do much for me. If it was due to lack of writing skill I'm more sympathetic but the effect was still annoying.The book is redeemed by the impressive amount of research. Stollznow seems to have visited each place and read extensively. The book is well illustrated by photographs, many taken by the author. The references given are a good starting point for anyone wishing to follow up.The Kindle edition is excellent with one major flaw. The Table of Contents does not appear in the menu; one must go to the beginning and page back to it. The Kindle edition is also rather overpriced; this is a rather short book for the asking price.The book can be recommended for those who aren't put off by the rather strange presentation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R47JMV4KFW7PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSQVBAQ#wasThisHelpful","R47JMV4KFW7PH","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More and more frequently these days I come across books because their authors are guests on podcasts I listen to. That was the case for the present book, the authors appearing on the ""Monstertalk"" podcast.This is a skeptical book but it is not a dismissive one. The authors take their subject quite seriously not the least because one of them (Loxton) is a convert from the believer camp. Often, when someone goes from believer to skeptic or skeptic to believer, it is merely to employ their irrationality, personal convictions, and close-mindedness in a new cause. But sometimes, as here, it is because the weight of evidence (or lack thereof) is bearing down irresistibly. Thus, in this book the reader comes away with the distinct impression that the authors are being fair and not grinding an axe.Beyond this, I was impressed by the amount of scholarship that went into this book. It is meticulously documented and the notes and references make up over a quarter of the book. A fair amount of this scholarship was harnessed to the task of their original contributions to the subject. This is especially apparent in their chapter on the sea serpent.There are five ""cryptids"" covered, bigfoot, yeti, the Loch Ness monster, the sea serpent, and ""Mokele Mbembe"". The coverage of the first four is excellent. The last appears to have been included to highlight the creationist agenda in cryptozoology but is certainly not without interest. The podcast interview said that other cryptids were cut on space grounds; I hope they can appear in a follow up book.The book concludes with a chapter where each coauthor gives his opinion on how much harm there might be in cryptozoology. Predictably, Loxton says not much, while Prothero opines that there is a great deal. I think Loxton makes the better case. Prothero comes off as shrill and alarmist.The Kindle edition is almost perfect. Even the index has its references linked. Since there are nearly hundreds of notes I do recommend reading this book on a touchscreen device to make navigation easier.About the only flaw in this book is the lack of a proper bibliography; the references have to be extracted from the notes. I'm sure lack of space played its part in the decision to omit one.Highly recommended to skeptics and believers alike. This is a fascinating, hard to put down book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTDZCN41MSKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAHA5F2#wasThisHelpful","RKTDZCN41MSKJ","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book as a result of two other interests converging. I am a fan of Peters' Amelia Peabody books and also a fan of Robert M. Price's books on religion and its influence on popular culture. One of the latter, ""Secret Scrolls"", is an overview of novels that have lost gospels as a plot point. Peters' ""The Dead Sea Cipher"" was one so I decided to give it a try.It's a fairly typical Peters' effort. It is more or less equal parts mystery, romance, humor, history lesson, and travelogue. The book is quite entertaining and absorbing although having been written in the late '60s somewhat dated. The characters are interesting and believable. The mystery is not exactly Christie-esque in complexity but serviceable enough. The action sequences are also well done. Pace is a little on the slow side because Peters likes to work in a lot of history and travelogue as the setting moves from Beirut to Damascus to Jerusalem to the Dead Sea but this is handled fairly efficiently.The books only flaw (as Price pointed out) is that the reader never actually does find out what all the fuss is about. One might argue that this is not what the book was ultimately about but still the reader is bound to be a little frustrated if he has any interest at all in biblical matters.I read the Kindle edition. The only flaw is that the chapters are not marked on the progress bar so the reader doesn't have an immediate indication how far he has to read to finish a chapter. Otherwise, no issues. I recommend that the reader bookmark the cipher when it appears so he can easily refer back to it as the characters puzzle it out over the subsequent chapters.Recommended. Fairly standard Peters fare but that is well above average.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3WTSNYAVO2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKRH4#wasThisHelpful","R3F3WTSNYAVO2W","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 15th Fantastic Four masterworks collects over a full year's worth of issues (151-163) and two Giant-Size (3 and 4) published originally in late '74 to late '75. This seems like a lot and sure enough it is; there are about 300 pages in this volume. But it must be remembered that the page count in Marvel comics was at its nadir during this period. Roy Thomas writes his usual detailed introduction. Despite his claims of continuity maintained while artists and writers were shuffled in and out I think only the artwork is of consistent high quality throughout.The first two story arcs in this volume are rather pedestrian. Both the ""Four Horseman"" story in Giant Size #3 and Thundra's origin in 151-153 start out interestingly enough but in both cases the resolution seems lame and contrived. The worst of the lot is 154 which is basically a frame for a reprint of an old Strange Tales Human Torch story (not included, mercifully). Fortunately, it only takes up a few pages.Then things begin to pick up. Giant Size #4 introduces Madrox the Multiple Menace with a guest appearance by Professor X of the X-Men. The X-Men were in publishing limbo at this time and were making guest appearances to maintain their presence in the Marvel world. Then there is a great three part Dr. Doom and Silver Surfer story in 155-157 with a great twist at the end. Next up is a two part story with the Inhumans that puts Sue back on the team and Medusa back with the Inhumans. Finally, a rather over plotted but entertaining four issue clash with Arkon.Extras are generous and comprehensive. We get covers for the all reprint Giant Size 5 and 6, an unused cover for Giant Size 5, and all the original material published in the Fantastic Four Marvel Treasury Edition.Not the best Fantastic Four masterwork but the production standards are as good as ever.

"This is the second of two volumes that cover the 25 year postwar history of the British Light Aircraft. The book is a laminated hardcover, 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", of 398 pages. The only color is the author's photo on the rear cover.This book covers the aircraft (and some projects) in alphabetical by manufacturer format. It is immensely entertaining and informative. It is also well illustrated by some well chosen black and white photographs and occasionally a reproduced contemporary advertisement or drawing. Some of the aircraft are illustrated with conventional three view drawings. These are on the crude side but do adequately convey the specifics of the aircraft in question.One strongly gets the impression that very little editing or production assistance was provided to the author by the publisher. He was very much left to fend for himself. The text is littered with typos like ""as"" instead of ""was"" and the like. There are also many misstatements like the Bristol Mercury being a sleeve valve engine or magnesium being an aluminum alloy that would never have slipped through had a professional editor gone over the manuscript. After warning us that the Auster designations are not a particularly useful way of sorting through the various Auster products the author does not exactly clear the matter up. A family tree would have been very helpful here and a more involved publisher could have provided one.Although the book can be read in its own right if one is primarily interested in aircraft details I strongly recommend reading Volume I first. Not only does it set the proper political, economic, and technical contexts in which these aircraft were developed it also contains many more photos of the aircraft covered. Only in Volume I does one get a peek inside the cockpit of the Chrislea Ace for a look at its unique control system. In Volume II the reader is merely told that John Taylor built his monoplane in his flat and had to pass the components through an upstairs window; in Volume I there are photos of this interesting process.Highly recommended despite the rather mediocre production values and sloppy editing. The author is not only an historian but a participant and this makes his two volume work an even greater value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUKZTYOT5LJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8361421920#wasThisHelpful","R3HUKZTYOT5LJ3","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After 150 volumes in this long running series there can't really be too many WWI era aircraft yet to be covered, certainly not if we restrict ourselves to the western front. There are still aircraft to be covered although the folks at Albatros Production must be hoarding them like precious gems at this stage. The 150th volume in the Windsock Datafile series covers the Austro-Hungarian Phonix C.1 two-seater.The book is consistent with the others in the series. It's a 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", 32 page, stapled card cover. Like the more recent Datafiles the card covers are coated on both sides so color can be properly displayed on the inside and outside front and rear covers. The front cover has the normal full cover painting and the rear cover the normal 3 color profiles, though the aircraft didn't have too many distinct color schemes. The inside front has color photos of factory models of the aircraft and a museum exhibit of the observer's gun. The inside rear has color photos of propeller decals and a fabric fragment.The text is well written and meticulously researched if the comprehensive notes are anything to go by. The aircraft history not only covers the service in Austro-Hungarian colors but also service in the nations formed from the breakup of the Hapsburg empire and post war service and new production in Sweden. The text is supported by a great many black and white photos. There are also six pages of line drawings in 1/72nd and 1/48th scale.It's a rare Windsock Datafile that can't be highly recommended.

"By now Windsock Datafile readers know that ""at War"" in the title means that the book is an update of a previous release. In this case, Windsock Datafile 35, authored by the late Peter M Grosz, devoted to the classic Rumpler C.IV, gets a facelift.The current book is still an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", stapled card cover. The page count is expanded to 40, up from the 36 pages of Windsock Datafile 35. The line drawings are more extensive in the current book with 7 pages of 1/72nd and 1/48th scale drawings compared to 3 pages in the earlier book. The color profiles are more numerous as well with the inside front and rear covers as well as the rear cover devoted to 7 new profiles including some plan views. Another feature of many ""at War"" titles is present here as well. There are 4 pages of color photographs of restored examples.The text relies heavily on the Grosz original but does reflect research done since its 1992 publication.

"This is the 18th (No. 16018) book in Kagero's Super Drawings in 3D series. The series seems to be doing well for Kagero if the rate of releases is any indication. Like others in the series this is an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"" (European A4), stapled card cover with 88 interior pages. The ""interior"" is a necessary modifier because the page numbering includes the card covers in this series for some reason. The book also includes an unbound foldout and a pair of 3D glasses (sigh). If buying secondhand make sure these are included. The books in this series usually come in a sealed transparent sleeve when new.The book kicks off with an 8 page history of the ship with a primary focus on the Pearl Harbor attack and the circumstances of her loss. I understand that a lot of new research has been done in the last 10 years or so, mainly with computer simulation brought to bear, and the text seems to reflect this. However, it is also clear that the text and the graphics are at odds at some points. The text implies that 4 3"" single guns were installed in place of the unavailable quad 1.1"" guns but the graphics show (correctly, I believe) empty positions.The meat of the book, as always, is the CAD drawings of the ship from innumerable angles. The quality is outstanding; the captions are something of a letdown. Some captions are attached to the wrong drawing. Some are repeated word for word. And most are not nearly as informative as they could be. The exclusive use of metric measurements is not appropriate for a ship designed to English units. Gun calibers rendered as 356 mm or 127 mm are okay since the English equivalents are well known. But describing searchlights as 30 cm, 60 cm, and 90 cm and boats as 8 m, 10 m, and 12 m without the English units is just unacceptable.This is the first book (I think) that has a painting-like centerspread, similar to the title pages the series has had for a while. These are not paintings but ""3D visualizations"", that is, computer generated. However created, they look great.Unfortunately, this book features the return of 3D anaglyphs which require the 3D glasses to render the depth. I have a horrible time getting this feature to work since I have poor eyesight without my conventional glasses. I think this feature is little more than a gimmick in any case.The foldout depicts the ship in conventional line drawings with five views in 1/350th scale on one side and some perspective line drawings of the superstructure on the other side.The series is heavily into large ships of the WWII era but at least they featured one built much earlier. Surely an aircraft carrier, a destroyer, or even an MTB, S-boote, or PT boat is due for a book?Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COBD90CVFKDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8362878533#wasThisHelpful","R1COBD90CVFKDM","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 14th book in publisher Jakab's unnamed series devoted to aircraft with a Czech connection. This is the second (and last) volume devoted to the French Morane-Saulnier MS.406. The book is in hardcovers this time; many earlier volumes were card covers. In any event it's 8-1/2"" x 12"" and has 96 pages. Like others in this series the text is bilingual with Czech (I'm guessing) in the left column and English in the right.The book picks up right where the first volume left off. It begins with the relative strengths of the French and German fighter arms before the German assault on May 10, 1940. Then we get a very detailed, almost sortie by sortie, history of the aircraft throughout the Battle of France up to the Armistice. The activities of Czech airmen serving with the French are highlighted. The story continues with the service of the MS.406 with the Vichy regime. This is more extensive than one might suppose with action ranging from North Africa to Syria to Indochina to Madagascar. The Free French service is covered. The service in Switzerland to enforce Swiss neutrality is related. Finnish service in the so-called ""Continuation War"" is quite detailed. There are brief notes describing the aircraft in German, Italian, and Croatian colors. The text concludes with a detailed technical description.The text is supported throughout by many black and white photographs. In addition, there are eight pages of color profiles and two pages of 1/72nd scale six view line drawings of the D3801 and the Morsko-Morane, respectively Swiss and Finnish MS.406 upgrades.The English translation is only fair but usually comprehensible. Another annoyance is the use of abbreviations for many French and Finnish ranks without explanation, for example, ""Cne."".

"This is the 6th book in Czech publisher Jakab's unnamed series devoted to aircraft with Czech connections. It's a square bound, 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"" card cover. Color is restricted to the color profiles; the front cover has a colorized photo while the rear cover is devoted to other Jakab books. The text is in two columns; the left in Czech (I presume) and the right in English.The book is the first of two(?) devoted to the French Morane-Saulnier MS.406 C1. The text is somewhat more comprehensive than the title would suggest. The whole MS.406 family of aircraft including the MS.405, MS.407, MS.410, etc are covered. The text follows the background, design, and development of the aircraft and the service history up to the day of the German offensive in the West in May, 1940. The service history in Finland during the Winter War against the Soviets is also covered in some detail. The brief and uneventful service in Turkey is also covered. The text is supported by many black and white photographs. These are not of the highest quality but no doubt the best available. The Czech connection is through the service of Czech airmen in France flying the aircraft after the German annexation of Bohemia and Moravia.The book concludes with four pages reproducing drawings and photos from period technical literature, three pages of 1/72nd scale, six view line drawings of the MS.405 C1, MS.406 C1, and MS. 410 C1, and eight pages of color profiles of various aircraft.The next volume(s) will no doubt finish the story off. The book is highly recommended.

"The 94th book in the thirty year plus span of the Naval Fighters series is devoted to the F7U-1, Chance Vought's innovative but ultimately unsuccessful fighter. It is consistent with other books in the series, a square bound, 8-1/2"" x 11"", 128 page card cover, with color restricted to the front and rear covers.The contents are much different from most Naval Fighters titles, though. Where most Naval Fighters books devote a few pages at most to the background, design, and development this book is almost entirely devoted to these issues. This is virtually a cradle to grave, blow by blow account of the F7U-1 program from conception as the Navy's first swept wing, afterburning, transonic fighter to test aircraft for the redesigned F7U-3. It is important to note that this book does not cover the F7U-3 program except where it intersects the F7U-1. Other Vought proposals based on the F7U-1 and competitors are also covered.The book meticulously covers all aspects of F7U-1 development in the context of the times - shrinking budgets in the late 1940s and desperation to get a swept wing fighter into naval service once the MiG-15 appeared in Korea. The airframe and engine problems are gone into in fine detail. The text is supported throughout by many black and white photographs, contemporary drawings, and even some drawings that have been specially prepared for this book.The only reservation I have about the book is that it is aimed at a reader with considerable aeronautical knowledge. If phrases like ""marginal lateral stability"" and the like mean little to you the value of the book will be diminished. Other than that the book tends to be a little too ""Navy centric""; other than pilots Vought personnel are rarely if ever named. I've read elsewhere that this was the last aircraft that longtime Vought designer Rex Beisel was involved with; no hint of that here.Also this should not be considered a replacement for the earlier Naval Fighters book covering the F7U series as a whole. The two are actually complementary.Highly recommended. There's no hint if a follow on book covering the F7U-3 is in the works. That would be great, of course, but the present book stands fine on its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8CGOGVD2FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984611479#wasThisHelpful","R2X8CGOGVD2FO","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Physically, the book is in the standard Ginter format. It's an 8-1/2"" x 11"", square bound card cover with 240 interior pages. Color (unfortunately) is restricted to the front and rear covers. It is also the first book in the Air Force Legends series in 6 years.I suspect that this book was originally intended for another publisher. This book would not have been out of place as a Specialty Press title when Specialty still issued new works. It is organized unlike any other Ginter title I've read.The book has a brief 6 page introduction (numbered A-F). Then there are 6 chapters dealing with the major B-50 subtypes.1. The B-50A2. The B-50B, RB-50B, YB-50C, B/RB-54A and XB-55 (includes the later RB-50E, F, and G models)3. B-50D and WB-50D4. The KB-50, KB-50J, and KB-50K Tankers5. B-50 Test and Research & Development Aircraft6. The TB-50A, TB-50D, and TB-50H TrainersThe book closes with 5 tables and a comprehensive list of sources. The inside rear cover reviews the Academy plastic kits.All is outstanding. The book is very well illustrated with black and white photos and drawings from contemporary technical literature. Everything is very well organized with each subtype getting a more or less uniform treatment so the reader comes away with a very comprehensive look at the aircraft. The illustrations are very well captioned.The text complements the graphical material perfectly. Outstanding are the modifications necessary to enable the aircraft to carry atomic bombs. There is also a fascinating look into how complex (and ponderous) the preparation for a nuclear attack was circa 1950. The early (pre-flying boom) refueling techniques, weather reconnaissance, photo-mapping, photo-reconnaissance, and training aircraft are also expertly placed into the context of their times.The only error I could find was the use of ""procession"" when ""precession"" was meant. That's really reaching, of course. Other than that, the only complaints are the shortcomings of the publisher. The overall lack of color is the biggest disappointment. It would have added a great deal to the book. A table of contents and an index would also have added to the value of the book as a standard reference.Very highly recommended. If for some reason the Ginter connection puts you off (and it really shouldn't; Ginter publishes many fine aircraft monographs) rest assured that this book doesn't suffer from most of the Ginter shortcomings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EATTCEALKZ4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984611495#wasThisHelpful","R1EATTCEALKZ4W","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...but otherwise fairly solid.The books collected in this volume tend to be not as highly regarded as they might otherwise have been. The reason is that the ""Celestial Madonna"" storyline immediately follows the issues in this collection and that the stories in this collection suffer by comparison. Be that as it may, taken on their own terms most of the stories in this volume hold up fairly well.The first five issues, 120-124, feature the Avengers vs. the Zodiac which segues into the origin of Mantis. Ongoing subplots include the mental breakdown of the Swordsman, Mantis' increasing attraction to the Vision, and the latter's estrangement from the Scarlet Witch. It's fairly action packed and entertaining with a few silly plot points like the Avengers being launched into space to kill them (just blowing them up wasn't good enough?) and the Stalker being sensitive to sunlight.We then get into the first crossover with Captain Marvel with the Avengers defeating Thanos' space fleet. Captain Marvel 33 is then reprinted for no discernible reason other than Mantis appearing in a few panels. This is a complete waste of space in an Avengers Masterwork as the reader has no hope of following that intricate plot.We then get a Giant Size Avengers which reintroduces the Golden Age Whizzer back into continuity as the father of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch and something else. The Whizzer's fatherhood doesn't last, however.There is a one issue spotlight on the Black Panther and then we get another crossover, this time with the Fantastic Four and the Inhumans for the wedding of Quicksilver and Crystal. It isn't too bad but having just read it in Marvel Masterworks Fantastic Four 15 lessened the impact.The book closes with an interesting development with Agatha Harkness and the Scarlet Witch. The issue (and the collection as a whole) ends on a cliffhanger which kicks off the aforementioned ""Celestial Madonna"" storyline.The primary creative weakness is the art. Lots of pencillers and inkers and some work better than others. The art in the first few issues in this volume looks horribly rushed.Steve Englehart contributes a very informative introduction. An interesting item is the practice at the time to draw one page of art and then blow it up to a two page spread to pad the page count.Recommended to fans of the Masterworks and/or the Avengers. Not great by any means but fun and entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P066CN9GNJXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785166297#wasThisHelpful","R3P066CN9GNJXI","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 148th book in the long running Windsock Datafile series is, like all the others, an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", stapled card cover. There are 32 interior pages and color is restricted to the card covers although in the case of the interior rear cover it is just a promotion for the other de Havilland titles in this series.The book covers an aircraft not previously dealt with in this series, a rarer and rarer event as the number of volumes mount. The AMC DH1 and DH1A was the first of a distinguished line of aircraft that extended over two companies and many decades. Unfortunately, the aircraft itself had few opportunities to distinguish itself being built in small numbers and not as highly thought of as the contemporary FE.2 series.The book is well up to the high standards of the series. There is an informative text supported by many black and white photographs, six pages of high quality line drawings in 1/72nd and 1/48th scales, and three color profiles on the rear cover. Much is made of the fact that the de Havilland designs of the WWI era are now complete in the Windsock series. Interestingly, the Aircraft Manufacturing Company, which built the WWI de Havilland designs, is now rendered ""AMC"" instead of the former ""Airco"". The text claims that the former was the practice during the war. If that was the case then where did ""Airco"", in widespread use for many decades even in the early Windsocks, come from?In any event the book is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCILVDHVRQ2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005W7LICA#wasThisHelpful","R1FCILVDHVRQ2J","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is number 60 in the long running Naval Fighters series by publisher (and for this volume, author) Steve Ginter. It is a stapled card cover, 8-1/2"" x 11"", of 56 pages. Color, as usual, is restricted to the front and rear covers.The book is a unit by unit history of the F9F Panther in USMC service and service with the Reserves, Blue Angels aerobatic team, and Argentine Navy also included. This sort of thing is Ginter's bread and butter (though not usually mine). Since several units served in the Korean War with this aircraft the histories are more interesting than they might otherwise have been. It seems well detailed with pilots who lost their lives either in combat or accidents properly memorialized.The histories as always are complemented by many black and white photographs so modelers will have no shortage of schemes to depict. A book aimed at modelers really demands more color but the series apparently does not command that kind of budget.Recommend for those familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the series. You know what you're in for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBFS1ZMLC9XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0942612604#wasThisHelpful","R2LBFS1ZMLC9XU","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 15th book in Kagero's excellent and groundbreaking Super Drawings in 3D series (No. 16015). It is an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"" stapled card cover with 80 pages of interior text and color throughout. I say interior pages because the page numbering includes the card covers for reasons that escape me as the interior covers are blank.The book has all the strengths of the other books in this series, namely the many pages of impressive CAD (computer aided design) drawings of near photographic quality. The views are spectacular. The captions do the best they can but there is so much detail in these drawings that one sometimes wishes that labels could be placed on the drawings proper so one is never unclear about which level is the battle bridge or compass bridge or anti-aircraft platform or whatever. What one really wants is access to the computer model itself so the reader can peel back and replace drawing levels to suit or pick any view he wishes. I think that will happen eventually; in the meantime I'm grateful for these books.There is also an unbound foldout with large scale conventional line drawings of the ship. If buying secondhand be sure that this is included.The text in these books is always somewhat basic but in this case I feel the text is fairly misleading. The text describes the ship essentially as built but the ship is depicted as it appeared very late in her career. The ship went through a very thorough rebuilding in between but there is little hint of this in the text. The title, Battlecruiser - fast battleship Haruna, is probably the best indication the book provides. The horsepower doubled, the ship acquired blisters, the armor (especially the deck armor) was improved dramatically but the text gives little indication and no details of all this. I think the problem was that text from author Skwiot's book on Japanese battleships might have been reused here without adequate editing.Some readers might have a problem with the subject of the book being a sister ship of the subject of an earlier book in this series (Kongo was covered in 16005). I don't have a big problem with this (the books on the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau also depict sister ships) but would have preferred a ship of another class.The book, despite these flaws, can be heartily recommended. The vast majority of readers are probably very familiar with the ship's design history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QXF0PFQYHFBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=836287838X#wasThisHelpful","R2QXF0PFQYHFBM","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of AJ Press' ""middle period"" releases. It has an expanded page count that takes it out of the stapled bound format that was used early on but the unbound foldouts (sometimes two or three or more) that are ubiquitous today haven't yet made an appearance. The captions are also still exclusively in Polish and not Polish and English like their current releases. Also the title of the series has just changed form the original ""Monografie Morskie"" to the current ""Encyklopedia Okretow Wojennych"". The current book carries a 1999 copyright date.Physically, the book is an 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"" (European A4), square bound, 100 page card cover. Color is restricted to the cover painting and the nine color profiles distributed equally among the front and rear inside covers and rear cover. The text is entirely and exclusively Polish.The book is the third volume (of four) covering the German U-boat arm in World War II. The book appears to cover the U-boat types from IX to XIV. The Type IX is given the bulk of coverage, naturally. The graphical content will be the primary to the English speaker. There are lots of black and white photographs, many of indifferent quality, but many of interest also. There are also some body lines and line drawings of the various (including unbuilt types). The Type IXC and C/40 subtypes also have a couple of pages devoted to the specific conning tower and ballast tank ventilation holes of the individual U-boats which will be of interest to the modeller.There are also 4 pages (with drawings and photographs) detailing various attempts to launch rockets from U-boats. Finally, the last 9 pages (again, with drawings and photographs) detail the history of accommodating aircraft aboard U-boats.Although not entirely without interest to those of us with no Polish skills the book might be worthwhile if the price is right. AJ Press will no doubt eventually be giving each U-boat type expanded coverage as they have for the Type VII but that can take a long time given their current rate of release for new titles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DXQL53EEBW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8386208880#wasThisHelpful","R17DXQL53EEBW9","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many respects this book is excellent. It has a lot of interesting information about the discovery and composition of exoplanets. The discovery techniques are gone into in commendable detail, especially the transit method. There is also a fair bit of historical background as well. The composition relies more on computer models but the breadth of possible planets (sort of like a planetary ""main sequence"") is also gone into in some detail. The astronomy end of the book is great.The biology part is a very different matter. Things start off well enough as the details of the origins of terrestrial life are reviewed. Then the author makes the plausible enough claim that a certain amount of geological activity is necessary for the development of life and earth's is just barely adequate. Super-earths, he asserts, with their greater geological activity would be more hospitable to the development of life.By this point we have arrived at the last chapter. The book has built up to and has been pointing to the climax promised in the the book's title, ""The Life of Super-Earths"". I was expecting the author to tie up the biology and astronomy and show how life on super-earths would differ from life on earth. Naturally this would be somewhat speculative but that doesn't matter.What we receive instead is a rather lame chapter on synthetic biology. Super-earths disappear from the narrative and we get a description of what biologists are hoping to do in the laboratory. All in all, I felt cheated. The promised punch line never came.The book can be recommended nonetheless as a relative recent recapitulation of events surrounding exoplanets, both discovery and theory.The Kindle edition was quite serviceable with a few flaws. There was an amusing glitch where exponents were linked to chapter notes. The print index was printed without the page numbers and was unlinked making it completely useless except as suggestions of terms to search for. Finally, the book was organized into two parts of six chapters each but only the parts are marked on the progress bar. Sparse progress bars are a particular annoyance as it doesn't give the reader enough indication about how much further he has to read before reaching a convenient stopping point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20C7HJPW9CLSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073SYAB2#wasThisHelpful","R20C7HJPW9CLSO","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to buy this book after the author's appearance on the Monstertalk podcast.The book gives every appearance of being comprehensive and definitive. The entire history of the lake monster phenomena is gone into in meticulous detail, possibly a little too meticulous. The first part of the book does drag a little as we are treated to sighting after sighting with little or no analysis. However, the author does have method to all this as he later contrasts the way the sightings have evolved over the centuries, specifically the ""head like a horse's"" meme that takes off after appearing in a popular regional magazine.The book then gets into high gear once the sightings get elevated to the level of an ongoing controversy. The parts about the Mansi photograph, the often eccentric monster proponents, and various possibilities floated to explain the sightings are expertly and very entertainingly done. The book is also very comprehensively documented. The author appears to have read everything ever committed to print about Champ.Also adding to the authority of the book is the author's acquaintance with most of the major figures surrounding Champ, both proponents and skeptics. It is clear that the author has no particular ax to grind.Complaints are minor. The author used a few words which baffled me and my Kindle dictionary such as ""shonky"". The online urban dictionary cleared that one up. The author also deviates from a strict chronological story at a few points which caused some confusion. There is also some repetition, especially with respect to the problems with the Mansi photograph which are gone into several times at different places.The Kindle edition is first rate with only one complaint that I have had with a lot of Kindle books. The book only has a few items in the table of contents which makes for a sparse progress bar. The sub-chapters needed to be marked on the progress bar as well.Highly recommended and I am encouraged to check out this author's other works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTWYDSB2ZBQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMKHHFE#wasThisHelpful","R1GTWYDSB2ZBQT","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The is was the 7th Goldsborough Nero Wolfe novel written with the permission of Rex Stout's estate. Like the rest of Goldsborough's efforts I thought the characterization was more or less spot on with a few minor reservations. Firstly, his Archie Goodwin is just a bit much; the wise cracks and sarcasm are overemphasized. Secondly, the whole broken elevator episode seemed gratuitous like Goldsborough was showing off how he can write Wolfe out of his element.The biggest gripes I have are with the plot. There is a certain ""Alice in Wonderland"" feel to it as Wolfe is asked to investigate the death of a writer who has taken over writing novels about a popular detective created by a recently deceased writer. And this writer, while adequately capturing the atmosphere and character nuances of his predecessor's fictional world, has trouble constructing interesting plots. These kind of life imitating art plot devices can be made to work but I think this particular device was more annoying than clever.Worse, I think the plot has a huge hole in it. While Wolfe's deductions are perfectly reasonable I couldn't for the life of me understand why the murderer would then confess. There didn't seem to be any proof whatsoever.The Kindle edition of this book has a few flaws but nothing major. The worst is that the table of contents, though linked, does not appear in the Kindle menu. It can be reached by going to the beginning and going back a page. There are a couple of footnotes to previous (Stout) novels that are not linked so one has to go to the end of the chapter to see them. The book also seems to have been scanned from the print edition so there are quite a few OCR glitches like stray periods and apostrophes.The book can be recommended but it is not up to vintage Stout levels or even the best Goldsborough. Nevertheless, it has its charms.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MPGQOB2U7QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VR4ST2#wasThisHelpful","R33MPGQOB2U7QU","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Queen mystery is in a transitional period between the plot driven early books and the ""psychological"" period that began with Calamity Town. Queen the author has by this time streamlined his books by jettisoning the clumsy frames of the early ones supposedly written by ""J. J. McC."" The mid-story ""Challenge to the Reader"" has also disappeared. Queen the detective is no longer a stuffed shirt but has not completely morphed into the likeable, sensitive, and vulnerable character to come.The mystery is fairly deep with a lot of complexity and easily a half dozen plausible suspects. Queen mixes it up somewhat by making a lot of the suspects quite sympathetic which impaired this reader's efforts to be objective. The murder itself was quite plausible with few strains on the credulity of the reader. On the other hand, I had just read The American Gun Mystery so maybe it looked better by comparison.Besides the mystery itself Queen spends much time lampooning Hollywood culture in particular and California in general. There is no doubt much real life experience being put to use here.The Kindle version of the book has a few flaws but nothing major. The Table of Contents is present and linked but does not appear in the menu. It can be reached easily enough however by going to the beginning and going back a page. The progress bar is sparsely populated with only the 5 ""Parts"" marked instead of the more numerous 21 ""Chapters"". Annoying, but not a deal breaker.All in all, fairly entertaining and perplexing.

"I came across this book by accident. I read the first six Goldsborough Nero Wolfe novels in the late '80s and early '90s and then when no more appeared I assumed the series had run its course. Actually, there was one more in the mid '90s and then this one much later. A title like ""Archie Meets Nero Wolfe"" is irresistible so I bought and downloaded the Kindle version.The book was good but lacked a certain inventiveness (just like the title). My main disappointment is that the entire puzzle that Rex Stout had assembled is already complete with the exception of one piece, Archie Goodwin. Wolfe lives in his brownstone with Fritz and Theodore and the orchids with the office with the large globe and one red and many yellow chairs. He makes his living as a private detective hiring legmen like Saul Panzer, Fred Durkin, and Orrie Cather. He butts heads with the police represented by Cramer, Rowcliffe, and Stebbins. Etc, etc, etc. Archie is merely fitted into position. One wished that Goldsborough had backed up somewhat to a point where the puzzle was missing a few more pieces.Despite this the book does have some interesting scenes. The book is set in the early 1930s at the depths of the great depression. Archie is a 19 year old kid, worldly for his age, trying to make it in the big city. After getting fired from a night watchman job he tries to carve out a niche as a private detective working for Del Bascom. These pre-Wolfe preliminaries are the best part of the book in my opinion. Other interesting parts are Archie's first impressions of the people he will be spending a lifetime among.Like I said, Goldsborough, as in his previous novels, plays it pretty conservative, not straying too far from what Stout established. In his previous novels which were continuations of the Stout canon that was probably a wise course. In this prequel I think a little more inventiveness was indicated. Despite this, I recommend the book.The Kindle edition is perfectly formatted and a joy to read. Absolutely no issues. Indeed, Wolfe's large vocabulary probably makes the Kindle the preferred format.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZJ4LSUQSX3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VR4SSI#wasThisHelpful","R3QZJ4LSUQSX3O","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an early Ellery Queen mystery written and set in the early 1930s. These early Queen mysteries are somewhat of a mixed bag. On the one hand the stories are usually fairly cleverly plotted and the murders ingenuous. On the other hand Ellery Queen is depicted as an upper class stuffed shirt with extremely annoying speech patterns. Think of Philo Vance on a particularly bad day. The reader is usually prepared to put up with the latter to enjoy the former but fortunately Queen the author humanizes Queen the detective as the series of books approached the 1940s.To my mind The American Gun Mystery is one of the weaker early Queen novels. The plot involves murder during a rodeo in a crowded 20,000 seat arena. Trying to plot a baffling mystery given such circumstances is a very ambitious task which Queen does not quite pull off. Granted, in any ""classic"" murder mystery the reader grants the author a certain literary license in the way of plausibility. In real life complex murder plans are impossible to pull off because no murderer can possibly control the large number of real life variables. All we ask of an author is not to stretch our credulity too far. At several points in Queen's plot he asks way too much of the reader. Without going into details it is beyond reason that with 20,000 potential witnesses that the murderer and the subsequent hiding of the gun will not be witnessed by scores of people in the act. Certainly no rational murderer would risk this.Other annoyances are the completely unnecessary framing sequence and introduction by ""J.J.McC."" This serves no real purpose and Queen thankfully jettisoned it as he moved away from strictly ""whodunits"" to ""whydunits"".Still, the book is not a waste of time but I would not recommend it as one's first Ellery Queen book.

"This is the second novel from Elizabeth Dean featuring Emma Marsh, the first being Murder is a Collector's Item and the last being Murder a Mile High. The book was an entertaining read but was more enjoyable for the humorous elements, the well drawn characters, and the glimpse into the world of 1940 Boston than the mystery proper.The mystery was fairly lightweight but not without interest. This is the sort of murder where any number of people could have done it; the difficulty is all in narrowing the field down. Dean is no Christie or Carr but the details of the murders do show some planning.I think the plot might have been easier to follow had there been a floor plan or two included. The details of the manor do not seem to have been adequately described and in any event a picture is worth a thousand words. There are also some unfamiliar rooms like ""buttery"". These situations are where e-books shine. I hope the Dean books eventually have Kindle editions.Recommended. Rue Morgue Press made no mistake bringing this book back into print.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVC96N4CEPFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0915230283#wasThisHelpful","RXVC96N4CEPFY","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 90th volume in the long running Warpaint series. It is a 64 page, 8-1/4"" x 11-3/4"", stapled card cover with color throughout. Besides the numbered 64 pages there is an 8 page equivalent bound foldout with 1/72nd line drawings so make sure this is included if buying second hand.In common with other titles in the series there are six pages of color profiles, six to a page, and one page with a four view color drawing. There are four tables covering production, performance, available kits/decals, and operational units. There is a wide selection of photographs, many of which are in color. The usual ""In Detail"" section of close-up photos is a generous 5 pages in this volume. There is also 4 pages of nose art close-up photographs.It is the text that lets this book down so badly. It is either poorly written or very poorly edited. The text meanders all over the place and gets repetitive. Some sections begin in chronological order and then back up and repeat the same events. There are numerous typos that range from the merely annoying (""Curtiss LeMay"" instead of the correct ""Curtis LeMay"") to the incomprehensible (""...while an arrestor hook was fitted with an arrestor hook"").This is a shame because there is a fair amount of material here that was completely new to me such as the ""Reed Project"" and the British B-17C (Fortress I) operations. The author seems to have done a fair amount of original research and not just cribbed from the many published sources available on this famous aircraft but his presentation leaves much to be desired.The book can be recommended to the modeler who has been satisfied with the Warpaint titles in the past. The general enthusiast has much better books to choose from; this one is not hopeless, merely exasperating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZJ8IY2VVNH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6DVECS#wasThisHelpful","R2YZJ8IY2VVNH3","A3H9PLV6L2S194","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9PLV6L2S194?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Speaking as a both True Crime junkie and a Lapsed Catholic, I liked this book.  A lot.  I cut my baby teeth on stories of visions of Mary and the saints who had with them. I was also raised to understand that power within the Church comes to women *only* through mysticism and death.  The fact that the nuns of  Sant'Ambrogio lifted one of their own into ""sainthood"" in total defiance of the Vatican doesn't surprise me, as having a saint in the family brings attention-- and wealth -- to a convent. I'm not shocked that a young novice mistress wanted a cut of the local “saint’s” power and attention, nor am I shocked that she'd poison a fellow religious in order to keep said power and attention.  (Sex with the mysterious “American” was icing on the cake.) The fact is that the scandal of the Nuns of Sant'Ambrigio was to be *expected* in a world where feminine power remains exceedingly rare.Wolf's thorough, scholarly study is one of power, sexual intrigue, and poison wrapped in a cult of sainthood. Although, I had to concentrate in order to digest the formal language used in some of the quoted documents,  I enjoyed the way the story unfolded.  The author made the world and people that created the scandal understandable and very real.  Take away the period “clothing” and the events of the scandal could happen within any sheltered or closed community today.I spent a stormy weekend curled up with a cup of tea and The Nuns of Sant'Ambrogio. I’m happy I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Y0XKLJEGHNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351909#wasThisHelpful","R38Y0XKLJEGHNX","A2B7DW8XZMRMN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7DW8XZMRMN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Frangipani Hotel is one of the most delightfully strange novels I've read in a long, long time.

I don't want to give away the secrets hidden within the rooms of the Frangipani.  I want you to be drawn into its universe as I was -- lulled and then jolted by what lurks inside.Ms. Kuppersmith's writing is full and rich.

"I'm not exaggerating when I say that *Nurses and Midwives in Nazi Germany: The ""Euthanasia Programs"" is the last, *best* book about Aktion T4.  Not only do the editors provide an excellent over-view of how nurses and midwives participated in killing the disabled and mentally ill, but also Susan Benedict gives us new, detailed information on the nurses of Meseritz. For the first time ever, I read excerpts from the nurses' trial testimonies.  And I read the testimony of Elly Buchenschuss, the caregiver who said NO.( Because of German law, we cannot know the last names of the perpetrators, but I can honor Elly Buchenschuss the caregiver who refused to kill.) Ms. Benedict writes about the so-called consequences and the nurses' acquittals.  I cannot over-emphasize the importance of the chapter on Meseritz-Obrawalde. It alone would be worth the price of the book, but the other chapters are just as informative and every bit as important.This book shows how healthcare professionals were drawn into the machine of medicalized murder.  Doctors were given a choice whether or not  to participate in T-4, but nurses, in general, weren't.  Doctors gave orders, nurses followed those orders.  As Sister points out, many doctors and nurses of the day truly believed in the ""euthanasia"" of so-called ""useless eaters."" When an entire system is in place to kill, it's not easy to say No -- especially, when people were sent to concentration camps for distributing Von Galen's sermon.  But there were people like Elly who said No -- and none that we know of were sent away to concentration camps. Think about that.Nurses and Midwives in Nazi Germany: The ""Euthanasia Programs"" belongs on the shelf beside the works of Friedlander and Burleigh.  It's one of the top three books written about Aktion T-4 *in any language.* Buy this book for your archive, for your library, for your own use.  It's more than scholarly -- it's inherently readable.  When you read it, you'll learn so very much. I know I did.Speaking as both a T-4 Scholar and as a woman with multiple disabilities, I implore you to learn about the history written in this book.

"I chose this vacuum, because it's a ""lightweight"" -- and for its Swivel-Steering.  I am *more* than pleased with its performance and delighted that it's designed to brush dirt off of walls and other borders into the path of the vacuum. I really worked this Oreck before I wrote my review.  I've been able to vacuum my entire 900 foot house TWICE and have yet to fill its bag!  I mean, it sucked up Poodle hair poofies and dust from when my wall was sanded with equal ease. Score!PROS1) For being a ""light weight,"" it's certainly not a light-weight when it comes to design.2) Really does flatten out to get underneath tables, etc.3) Has brushes on the sides that guide dust and dirt off of walls and other borders and into the vacuum's path. I love those wee brushes!4) The Swivel-Steering makes vacuuming more of a pleasure than a chore.5) It's a bagged vacuum BUT its Oreck bags are HEPA filter in make.6) It's the *perfect* basic vacuum. Period. Great for your dorm, home or apartment!7) It's backed by the Oreck Warranty, which is one of the best in the biz.CONS1) It's a bagged vacuum. If you live in a small town or in an area without an Oreck store, you will have to order your bags online. I speak from experience.(This is the Perfect Basic Vacuum, so I'm not counting its lack of attachments has a Con.)Because I live in constant chronic pain, vacuuming is NOT a joy for me.  However, the Oreck Magnesium RS is the one upright I've owned that I can actually *use* with ease. It's now my official Downstairs Vacuum.

"Coffee is my secret pleasure.  I drink a cup once every six weeks or so -- and, as a result, I'm Demanding.  This SterlingPro French Press elevates the process of making coffee into a *pleasure* PLUS it makes a great cup of coffee.PROS1) It's a French Press, which in my world just makes smoother coffee.2) It's well-designed.

(I put it on the upper rack and it came out fine.)4) The double-screens mean no grounds in your coffee. I MEAN it! No Grounds.5) Comes with a set of extra screens.6) Ideal for making your morning cuppa plus your thermos cuppa for on the go!7) Can be used for making less than 1 Liter without affecting the process.

"If there'd been Rock Stars back in 1919, Sgt. Stubby would've been one. As it was, Stubby posed for pictures and led parades with equal aplomb.  His grin was beloved of the nation -- the United States. And he was a Pit Bull mix. I've loved Sergeant Stubby since I was a little girl.  In my Spent Youth, there wasn't Breed Specific Legislation - there was just the story about a Bully Dog  named Stubby, his Man Bob Conroy and the War to End All Wars.I loved this book.  I loved it, because Ms. Bausum brought the *dog* Stubby back into our lives. This book is really a love letter to what the relationship between humans and their dogs *can* and *should* be.  Even in the worst of times, Stubby loved and protected his Man, Bob Conroy. And Conroy returned the favor.I believe that Stubby's story has been ignored for two reasons over the years:  the years post WWI have been wiped clean by the horrors of the Spanish 'Flu, and Stubby was a Bully Breed. This wonderful book wipes the slate clean and starts at the Beginning of Conroy's and Stubby's relationship. From there, it's all about Love.While, this isn't a children's book, it could be read by and discussed with children of ages 10 and up who are interested in Sgt Stubby and in non-demonizing images of the Bully Breeds. (It would make a GREAT book report after a trip to the Smithsonian!) *Sergeant Stubby* should be required reading in *all* police departments, because officers need the chance to see Pit Bulls in ways other than Mean. (Read a book, save a dog's life!)  Stubby's story can and has opened hearts and minds to the Love of a dog.PROS:1) It's all about Sgt Stubby.2) But it's really about Love.3) And... Drum roll, please.... Sgt Stubby was a Pit Bull mix! And he had The Smile. Yes, he did! Y'all know I love me a Pittie Smile.SORT OF A CON1) Stubby was ""stuffed"" after his death.  His ""taxidermied body"" now resides in the Smithsonian and has appeared on the TV Series *Mysteries at the Museum.*  I first saw Stubby at the Smithsonian and heard his story as a child.  I wasn't upset, but many of the adults in my world were.*Sergeant Stubby: How a Stray Dog And His Best Friend Helped Win World War I and Stole the Heart of a Nation* belongs in every War Dog lover's library, and every dog owner's library. But mostly, give it to your friends and relatives who think you're crazy because you Love YOUR dog so much. Dollars to donuts, wee Sgt Stubby will melt their hearts -- just as he did the author's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6VCXK57RC0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426213107#wasThisHelpful","R3B6VCXK57RC0Q","A2B7DW8XZMRMN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7DW8XZMRMN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to think this stuff was too greasy for me...until I needed something to help heal a couple of shave biopsy sites incurred during a routine skin cancer screening. My doctor and others said that Vaseline was just as good as Aquaphor as the point of using either was to keep the sites moist enough not to ever completely dry out. Once they dry out, the skin doesn't ""fill in"" anymore and you will end up with a bad scar. So...I used the Vaseline to start, then I tried Polysporin.Well, after a week, I really wasn't seeing any improvement, so I decided to give Aquaphor a try instead. It's NOT just ""glorified petroleum jelly"" as the derm office said. It has panthenol in it, for one thing, and is less than half petrolatum. It has a stickier, less oily feel to it as well, so it stays where you put it unlike pet.jelly which melts and runs. No scent, of course, so that's great. From the maker: ""Unlike petroleum jelly, it creates a semi-occlusive barrier on skin, which creates an ideal healing environment that enables the flow of water and oxygen. It also absorbs the recovering skin’s own natural wound exudates, keeping the wound moist to help promote healing.""Well, it must be the reason, because within a couple of days of using the Aquaphor (and bandaids to keep the wounds protected), I noticed a marked reduction in the redness of the sites as well as a noticable calming of the skin. Another few days and the deep depression or ""divet"" quality of the sites started to fill in with new skin. Yay.It's been three weeks now and both sites are fairly healed, no bandaids necessary, both filled in significantly. I know they will continue to heal over the coming months, and that this will be aided by using the Aquaphor.Bottom line: Far superior to Vaseline or Polysporin for biopsy sites. I think it may be the different, thicker consistency and the panthenol (protein) that helps rebuild the tissue. I am going to use it exclusively from now on, plus try it for cuts, burns, and even just dry skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIVXY0CBMAIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NN7FXO#wasThisHelpful","R1TIVXY0CBMAIR","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you have combination skin AND you are becoming ""wiser"" every passing year, ahem...finding a scrub that isn't too harsh yet still works is a challenge.Some scrubs are way too sharp or the grit size is too large and can feel like they are meant to take off more than just the dull, dead skin. (I'll leave the walnut shells for the walnuts). Others are too small and delicate, made of synthetic, or disintegrate too fast and you end up with more like just cream on your skin, which does nothing except leave a film.This scrub is natural chia seed, so no super sharp edges or plasticky damaging beads. The scent is much like their apricot cleansing milk...very light and of course, natural. I use this scrub in the shower on my face and sometimes on my elbows, shoulders, and neck. Yes, neck. It's that gentle.So, my trifecta for soft skin is as follows: Andalou Naturals Apricot Probiotic Cleansing Milk, 6 Ounce, Andalou Naturals Chia Plus Omega Radiant Skin Polish, 2 Ounce, and Andalou Naturals Super Goji Peptide Perfecting Cream, 1.7 Ounce. If I'm going out in the sun for any length of time for day time, I love their combo sun screen/moisturizer, too, Age Defying Ultra Sheer Daily Defense 2.7 fl oz Lotion.

"Got this product along with the Thera Tears eye drops (single vial form) on the advice of my ophthalmologist to take organic flax oil of some kind for blepharitis and dry eye. It's an interesting product; you've got a generous amount of vitamin e (natural version) to preserve the oils, and also to keep you from depleting your own vitamin E as you process the omega-3s. The fish oil is molecularly distilled, so it's likely clean, yet they leave it in the natural triglyceride form. However, there is no listing on the label for what country the fish and flax oil comes from or from what kind of fish. That info is pretty standard for most companies. You might write to them to find out.Also, minus one star because they use soy bean oil (not sure how much as the label does not state) as a carrier for the vitamin E. Also, plant omega-3s in flax oil are only absorbed at a rate of about 4% in humans, as opposed to 100% for the omega-3s in fish oil. So when it says on the label that you are getting 1,200mg of omega-3, that's fish and flax combined, so not all usable omega-3. Something to think about.And keep in mind, this product is not registered on the IFOS website which is the best third-party testing lab for fish oils. But perhaps that's because of mixing in flax oil, making it impossible to test it this way. Not sure.The vitamin E is a problem for me as there is a LOT in this product, over 600% of your daily value. It, as well as other high-dose Es I have tried, causes me great alertness in the daytime and enhanced memory....but the massive vivid dreams won't let me sleep long enough. I keep waking up! I thought about cutting the dose down to one or two softgels, but then the omega-3 would be too low.The serving size is 3 softgels, each a small 850mg in size, with Amazon pricing about 36 a day, equaling:1,600mg of fish oil (triglyceride form)1,000mg organic flax oil, yielding totals of:EPA 450 (from fish omega-3)DHA 300 (from fish omega-3)ALA 450 (plant omega-3)Vitamin E as natural d-alpha tocopherol acetate:183IU (over 600% of your daily value!)Mixed tocopherals including gamma:20So, all in all, Thera Tears is a pretty good deal.

"As I get older, and though I have no serious eye issues now (other than astigmatic presbyopia), I have noticed that my vision isn't what it used to be. I get my regular exams (just went yesterday and all is good), but I do have floaters and I've noticed that my night vision isn't quite as sharp as it used to be. So, in reading about the research into eye supplements (what works, what doesn't), of course I came across the AREDS1 and 2 studies, and discussions on omega-3, lutein, and zeaxanthin. From the American Optometric Association site on the subject:""Beyond reducing the risk of developing eye disease, separate studies have shown that lutein and zeaxanthin improve visual performance in AMD patients, cataract patients and individuals with good health. Although there is no set recommended daily intake for lutein and zeaxanthin, most recent studies show a health benefit for lutein supplementation at 10 mg/day and zeaxanthin supplementation at 2 mg/day."" And although omega-3 is important, it wasn't as powerful as the lutein/zea combo. You can read the total outcome of the AREDS2 study at www.areds2.org.So, when I saw this product from Nordic, I was intrigued. Nordic has included a generous amount of DHA, at 788mg and EPA at 158mg, and 20mg of lutein and 4mg of zeaxanthin in two softgels--the perfect lutein/zea ratio. So, following the AOA and AREDS2 guidelines, you really only need to take one of these to get your 10mg of lutein and 2mg of zeaxanthin. Even at one softgel, you are still getting plenty of DHA at 394mg plus 95mg of EPA. Plus, in one softgel, you get 15IU of natural vitamin E, half the day's total. And since these are supplements...you will be adding to these totals with your great diet of lutein/zea-rich foods, like kale, spinach, and broccoli. Most people should have more than enough at day's end.All in all, a brilliant product and adjustable to boot. Oh, and FYI; their Omega Vision is the EXACT same product, it's just marketed to the consumer instead of optometric professionals like the ProDHA Eye is. There is no difference in the two...but the price of this one is a bit nicer on Amazon. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWJOIRVHTKTLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CQU51O#wasThisHelpful","RWJOIRVHTKTLO","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This one is sourced from New Zealand.But that's why we do these reviews, double check with the manufacturers on ingredients and sourcing, etc.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MPXVT44SFM0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OQIX0#wasThisHelpful","R2MPXVT44SFM0B","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As we age, our ability to make gamma linolenic acid (GLA) starts to wane. Our skin can get dryer and thinner along with other lovely side effects. I decided to try a GLA oil to see if I could see any skin improvement in texture or moisture. I checked out borage oil and evening primrose oil (EPO) as well. While borage oil has the highest yield of GLA per milligram, there is no omega-3 as in black currant, and there is always the possibility of left over pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) that may contribute to liver damage. EPO is the weakest of the GLA oils, plus it can have undesirable estrogenic effects. Black currant oil is right in the middle; good yield of GLA and no known side effects, PLUS you get omega-3.It's important to know that this black currant oil is NOT hexane-extracted, like NOW Foods and many others. It is cold-pressed, much like olive oil, so you are left with clean, pure BCO.This 1,000mg size is decent and easy to get down. If it is too big for some, this also comes in a half-size 500mg version. Health From The Sun Black Currant Oil Softgels,  500 mg, 180 Count. It allows you to take one in the morning and one at night, if you wish. Either way, you're still getting a good amount of GLA. (Their sister company, Solaray, also makes a compact 600mg size, also cold-pressed, here Solaray Hexane Free Black Currant Seed Oil Gla, 90 mg, 90 Count.)My only ""beef"" with this product is that the gelatin source is porcine (pork) as it says on the label. I give them credit for at least telling us (probably for those who cannot eat pork products) as most manufacturers just say ""gelatin"" and leave it at that. Usually, unless otherwise stated ""gelatin"" means beef. For those who can't use pork products, they do make these in a veggie gelatin in the 1,000mg size.

"There was another review about this product and the hexane issue, so I chose to investigate for myself.This product may have hexane in it because that is their extraction process. I just called NOW Foods today and reconfirmed that they do indeed use hexane for extraction. I asked them why they don't put that on the label, and the rep said that ""it's a very negative thing to put on a label."" lol No kidding. I asked them if there was any residual hexane solvent in the oil, and they said ""no, none that is detectable, but we don't want to put that on the label either to draw attention to the fact that we use hexane at all."" So, there you go. She also said that ""black currant oil CANNOT be cold-pressed."" Not true. It's just cheaper to use hexane because the company can get more out of each seed.There may well be no hexane residual in this product, but we as consumers have no way of knowing. What bothers me most is the fact that NOW chose not to tell us anything. This reminds me of their ""krill oil blend"" issues with NKO...but that's another story. Makes me wonder about their other products as well if this is their way of doing things. They always have the lowest prices...I'm beginning to see why.On the opposite side, I called Health from the Sun about Health from the Sun Black Currant Oil 1000mg, 60-Count and they do cold-pressed, much like the process for olive oil, so what you are left with is pure, clean BCO. Solaray uses the same method, so they're good too. They are a sister company of Health from the Sun, and they make a compact 600mg version softgel that is great: Solaray Hexane Free Black Currant Seed Oil Gla, 90 mg, 90 Count.Hope this helps someone make a more intelligent decision.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Q70XAQUVBUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8PJC4C#wasThisHelpful","R30Q70XAQUVBUC","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed that was different about these softgels is the size....they are a much more manageable 800mg size instead of the average 1,000mg or even the larger 1,200mg. You take three per serving, so a total of about 2,400mg of wild salmon oil. Pretty normal amount from brand to brand. For those who care, the gelatin is made up of a 80/20 split of bovine/porcine (beef/pork). Therefore, these are not Kosher or Halal.The other thing is the color; a much deeper orangey-red than say, Wholemega or Solgar's, or even Vital Choice's sockeye salmon oil. But that's because Barlean's adds a LOT of additional astaxanthin to this oil, so you are getting substantially more of this antioxident (a whopping 500mcg per serving) than you would naturally get in straight wild salmon oil (normally about 20mcg). This helps to preserve the oil itself, but it is not natural in this case.They also add 1,000IU of vitamin D3, another bonus. But D3 is very inexpensive, and many people take that separately. Also, you get a smidge of Lutein at 6mcg. Not sure why they added this, no one else does, but it doesn't hurt anyone, to be sure.These are 100% pure, whole wild Alaskan salmon, but I don't know what types. I'm trying to find that out, too. It matters because sockeye is the most prized of the salmons for astaxanthin and for stronger omega profiles. (That's why it can get costly).One more thing that matters a great deal is that this oil, unlike most wild salmon oils, is tested by batch with the IFOS (International Fish Oil Standards Program). This is a very well-known and reliable third-party lab (a real lab, not like Consumerlabs.com). You can take any batch number off a bottle of Barlean's Wild and Whole and see exactly what's in it and what's not. Very important.One reason I'm giving it one star off is partly because they feel the need to add ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and citric acid to the oil. According to Barlean's, they are a part of the antioxidant package to support the oil freshness. Yet none of the other leading salmon oils add either of these ingredients. Interesting.Which brings me to the cost of this product. Ouch. I only use retail prices for comparisons because Amazon prices, as we all know, can fluxuate wildly. I bought the 90-count of these today at Whole Foods for a hefty $33. At three a day, that's a month's supply. I also bought New Chapter's Wholemega, 60-count for $22, a month's supply at two a day. I also bought Solgar's wild salmon oil, 120-count for $30, a TWO month's supply at two a day. So, $33, $22, or $15 a month. But then, only Barlean's is IFOS tested...So, if you want substantial extra astaxanthin, a more pleasant size, IFOS testing, and don't mind paying top dollar, these may be just perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLTKNLHCTLXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084YAXE2#wasThisHelpful","RDLTKNLHCTLXG","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What this shampoo does for my hair is amazing. I've noticed that when I use my Andalou sulfate-free shampoo, I have to use a lot of conditioner. No prob. But when I use the Therappe, one shampoo and I get a really conditioned, silky feel even when I'm still in the shower. Sometimes I think I could get away with no conditioner at all...but I still go ahead and use my Andalou Brilliant Shine conditioner or Shikai Intensive conditioner just for protecting my ends. (My hair is fine, thick, almost straight, tangles easily, and is just past my shoulders).And that scent....wow. Nothing smells like it. It's like coconut, but not annoyingly so. Such a nice experience lathering this up! It's like a little trip to the islands.When I go to comb my hair, the comb slides right through easily. And when I blow dry it out straight, I've noticed that it is smoother, healthier feeling, has fewer fly-aways, and looks good longer...even into the second day. I normally have to wash my hair every day to get it to feel right, but I can go two with this shampoo.Now they have just come out with a new version with Caviar Complex. They took out the nettle, rosemary, and added three new proteins and some quats...which to me equals possibly crunchy hair. So, I scoured my neighborhood stores to buy up what I could find of the old formula. Others must have been doing the same as I didn't find much! lol I have no interest in the new formula. It doesn't even smell the same, and that is one of the HUGE selling points of this shampoo.

Yet with the salmon oil, you are getting the full natural complement of all the omegas, including the important 7 and 9. And both products are the natural triglyceride form, closest to actually eating fish.I can see using both of these oils together to get the higher omega-3 of the anchovy/sardine and yet the full-spectrum of the salmon oil. Two of each would give you 1,100mg of omega-3 a day, which is perfect for most people.

"When I first opened the box, I thought that it would be too small of a sign to be seen from the sidewalk by the dog owners. The size is about 9X7 inches. But looking at it after I put it in the lawn, it works just fine. If it were any larger, I think it would look odd for a residence. It would look more like a park sign, and that's not what we want.The sign is made of fairly heavy aluminum, nice quality of enamel paint, good contrast from greenery of the landscaping, so it can be seen well from a distance. The stake is very thick and sturdy and will stand up to a lot of pushing and pulling and hammering, it seems. We have VERY hard soil here in AZ, so I had to smack it with a hammer many times to get it to go in. Just don't hit the sign itself!I chose the wording on this version because we have a problem with off-leash dogs as well as lazy owners not cleaning up after their dogs. The wording is direct, and firm, but still polite. We will see if it works as far as the dog owners paying attention to it.

"Got this little ""starter kit"" very quickly. The vials are glass with little pumps built in (they do not open), just FYI. They were all full and in good shape. Arrived via USPS in a little ziplocked container with bubble wrap securely around them.What I received was slightly different from what was listed as far as names of fragrances. But they listed 11 not 10 (10 is the right number). Here's what I received in my collection:Nectarine Blossom and Honey--First favorite. Sensual and the most natural, like ""hey, let's curl up on the couch and snuggle.""Wild Bluebell--Second favorite. An unusual flower scent, very ""pretty.""English Pear and Freesia--Third favorite. Crisp like ""hey, let's go for a hike.""Blackberry and Bay--Fourth favorite. I really didn't expect to like this one. I mean, bay? Cooking bay? It works somehow. But I smell a little like a holiday dinner.Red Roses--VERY realistic, but not the kind of roses I grow. These are more tea rosey.Orange Blossom--Exactly like an orange blossom, right down to the sort of bitter under tone.Grapefruit--Not what you might expect. Surprisingly manly.Lime Basil and Mandarin--Great, but like many of her scents that are marketed to both men and women...smells a bit too unisex for me.Earl Grey and Cucumber--Tart, tangy and kind of ""shouts"" out at me. Nope.Pomegranate Noir--Fruity, tangy, earthy, loud. Has a bit of patchouli in it. Not for me. Might be good for a swingin' night club...on someone else.The two scents listed in the product description, Amber and Lavender, and Vanilla and Anise were not in my order. I think those two must be rotated in and out, because I got Red Roses instead. And I'm good with that because I don't like Anise at all anyway and am not a fan of lavender. :)As far as the scents themselves go, wow.

"IT WORKS! We tried every other humane way to keep off-leash dogs from crapping all over our lawn. We tried the Havahart Critter Ridder (spray and granules), but the dogs couldn't have cared less. We tried a sprinkle of curry powder on ""favorite"" spots. Nothing.But this, well, this baby works perfectly. Took some time to get adjusted perfectly so only the offenders would be sprayed (not our good dog neighbors), but it is really sensitive and has a great range. You can adjust distance, duration, night, day, all the time, or off, plus how high or low the spray shoots. To get it even lower to the ground, just tilt the device forward a bit. I would advise actually reading all the directions. Really simple and yet helpful.The only issue was some dripping at the hose connector, but I solved this with a dab of Plumber's Putty. No biggee. The unit is FAR superior to the Scarecrow and worth the extra $$ as this one is mostly metal with a brass hose bib and metal foot push. The Scarecrow is ALL plastic. There really is no comparison.We only have it on at night (turn the unit and the hose off during the day) as that's when the offenders come out. The dogs hear the unit click on and so you get the spray and the sound of the water AND the element of surprise. Should start to train the dogs not to come on our lawn. Now if we could only train the off-leash owners.Word of caution: I have accidentally sprayed myself a few times as I forget it's on after a while. haha Just make sure you turn it off before you go running outside! Also, make sure not to turn it on for the night if you are expecting any deliveries....we tagged the Ontrac guy the other day and it was really embarrassing. He was nice about it, but be careful.

"I would only recommend this type of product for those treating actual conditions such as high triglycerides or heart disease as they are in the concentrated ethyl ester (EE) form, just FYI, not natural triglyceride (TG) like their ""Very Finest Fish Oil"" softgels and liquid. So, you are getting a bit more EPA and DHA than in the natural oil version in fewer softgels.As with all Carlson's products, these softgels are clean and third-party tested (verifiable on IFOS's website). The size is ok; not a tiny 500mg like some, but not a huge 1,200mg size like so many other high-powered concentrates. These are a do-able 1,000mg and slide down pretty easy.The softgels are, like all of Carlson's softgels, made of beef gelatin (for those of you who prefer not to eat pork gelatin). I like how they include a smidge of vitamin E (10IU) to not only preserve the oil better, but to help you keep from being slightly depleted as you process the omega-3s.The EPA and DHA amounts in this product are almost identical to what's in Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, but Carlson doesn't use lemon oil. You get about 80mg more omega-3 in NN than Carlson, so the difference is negligible in that way. Personally, I'd rather have clean, clear gems of EE fish oil than cloudy lemon-flavored torpedoes. Plus, Carlson's is a better value. As for NN's claim to ""superior triglyceride form,"" it's not quite the same as natural triglyceride (TG) form. It's rTG, which is basically converted EE, which is close, but not exact. I do love the Nordic Naturals - Prenatal DHA - Unflavored - 500 mg 180 - Softgel, and take that every day as well for a little brain/eye boost. Tiny softgels and no lemon oil.If you need something even more powerful to treat a particular condition, Carlson The Very Finest Fish Oil Liquid Omega-3 Lemon, 500ml is always a great choice. One little teaspoonful will net you a whopping 1,600mg of omega-3 and it is in the original natural triglyceride form.Compared to their competitors (like Nordic Naturals) the prices cannot be beat. Carlson's tends to keep the prices of their items down to a realistic level, which, to me, speaks to their dedication to help as many people as possible with their oils.Good health and good choices to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LMCT987FRT0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BVIAW0#wasThisHelpful","R3LMCT987FRT0W","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give Deep Steep points for trying such a unique combination of grapefruit and bergamot, but it did not work for me at all. The lotion itself is a very nice consistency and soaks in well, but the fragrance for me was rather stifling.I'm still giving it three stars for originality and because the creme itself is very smooth and nice, AND they don't use fake ingredients.

"There was another review about this product and the hexane issue, so I chose to investigate for myself.This product may have hexane in it because that is their extraction process. I just called NOW Foods today and reconfirmed that they do indeed use hexane for extraction. I asked them why they don't put that on the label, and the rep said that ""it's a very negative thing to put on a label."" lol No kidding. I asked them if there was any residual hexane solvent in the oil, and they said ""no, none that is detectable, but we don't want to put that on the label either to draw attention to the fact that we use hexane at all."" So, there you go. She also said that ""black currant oil CANNOT be cold-pressed."" Not true. It's just cheaper to use hexane because the company can get more out of each seed.There may well be no hexane residual in this product, but we as consumers have no way of knowing. What bothers me most is the fact that NOW chose not to tell us anything. This reminds me of their ""krill oil blend"" issues with NKO...but that's another story. Makes me wonder about their other products as well if this is their way of doing things. They always have the lowest prices...I'm beginning to see why.On the opposite side, I called Health from the Sun about Health from the Sun Black Currant Oil 1000mg, 60-Count and they do cold-pressed, much like the process for olive oil, so what you are left with is pure, clean BCO. Solaray uses the same method, so they're good too. They are a sister company of Health from the Sun, and they make a compact 600mg version softgel that is great: Solaray Hexane Free Black Currant Seed Oil Gla, 90 mg, 90 Count.Hope this helps someone make a more intelligent decision.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CLZ2A89ARYX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O2TNKW#wasThisHelpful","R3CLZ2A89ARYX6","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because of all the great reviews, I took a chance on these larger earrings. I normally prefer things dime or nickel-sized, but have to say that these larger earrings are just lovely.

"I have a beautiful citrine ring in sterling that I received as a gift, and wanted some petite citrine studs to go with it. These seemed like a good deal and lovely.I normally love every single thing I've gotten from Silver Insanity...but these are the first item I've ever received that I can't and don't want to wear. The stones are a bit cloudy, but that I could over look. It's the stems that are the big problem. They seem to have some kind of coating on them and the ends are very rough and sharp. It's like the coating in peeling off in spots and making the surface of the posts uneven, thus causing the roughness. Not good for something that you are not only going to put in your skin, but that will be getting lots of wear from the pushing and pulling on of the backing.As a minor thing, one of the posts is rather crooked as well. Not the greatest construction.I wouldn't give these to anyone, or wear them myself. I may send them back or just chuck them. Not a good buy. Next time, I'll pay more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SL3UQGDYN6RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037KJNI0#wasThisHelpful","R1SL3UQGDYN6RH","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried a LOT of fish oils, liquid and gelcaps, and these are actually quite good, though lesser-known. Here are the stats as I see them:Size: These are quite large at 1,250mg size, which is 50mg more than Norwegian Gold Critical Omega, and 250mg more than Nordic Naturals, just for comparison. I took one star off for size as that might put some people off. You might just have to pop these and drink the oil.Potency: 1,000mg of EPA/DHA, PLUS 60mg more of other omega-3, which is great. Most brands use ALL of the omega-3s when they add up the potency, so it can be misleading. These are accurate. You only need one to get a full gram of omega-3 a day.Form: Molecularly distilled for purity and potency, and ethyl ester form. Take before meal with a bit of fat in it for best absorption.Third-Party Certs: IFOS and MSC-certified. Don't usually find either one of those, and usually not both together. Impressive.Color: Almost clear, no enteric coating.Taste and smell of gelcaps: Made of fish gelatin, NOT beef, so no ""beefy"" scent. This is a plus for me and a lot of other people. They say they are orange flavored (natural), but as has been said, I really don't detect any orange scent or taste. They are just very mild.Freshness: I always break one of the caps from a new bottle open to check the freshness, and these are lovely. They barely smell like anything. The Norwegian Gold caps were really stinky, for instance, as many other fish oils can be even when fresh. Perhaps because these are made in the U.S. from Alaskan pollock and hake, not herring, mackerel, or sardines (caught in Peru and Norway), which are decidedly smellier.Burp-back: None so far, but I still take it before a meal with fat to enhance absorption.Price: Some have said they are expensive, but considering that you are getting a full gram of omega-3 per gelcap, they are really not anymore expensive than other premium ultra-concentrates. Using retail prices, and only looking at omega-3 content, to get about the same omega-3 per serving, you have to pay $30 for a month's supply of Norwegian Gold Super Critical Omega, or $28 for a month's supply of Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (and you have to take two gelcaps). Barlean's is $20 per month.Do they work for joint and mental agility improvement? You'll have to test that for yourself!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QIEQ9R284C4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BR3ZEQ4#wasThisHelpful","R3QIEQ9R284C4M","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these as a gift a few years ago and have worn them often. They are very versatile as they can be rather dressy or casual, depending on what you are wearing them with. I recently was updating my sterling jewelry, tossing some things that I've grown tired of, debating on others that aren't aging well, but these beauties were a no brainer....keepers. They look as nice as the day I got them!They are shiny, but not overly so as to look fake. They are a nice length and weight, kind of medium. The knotting is very clear and a lovely pattern. Substantial, yet feminine.Silver Insanity is becoming my ""go-to"" company for good silver; reliable quality, great designs, fast shipping, nice velvet pouches, and no, they aren't on ""prime,"" but it doesn't really matter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNZF8HG3EG4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00023JOCA#wasThisHelpful","R2NNZF8HG3EG4Q","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this little beauty years ago as a gift and have worn it often. The moon is almost exactly the size of a dime. The loop is sturdy and goes well with the moon. The choice of chain is subtle and works well, too. This is a quality weight item, yet it is not excessively heavy. Perfect for me.I was thrilled to find that Silver Insanity also makes matching earrings Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Crescent Moon Earrings available here on Amazon (also dime-sized), so I scooped those up last week.

"Well, score another one for Renew Life, though they didn't ""create"" chia seeds...and that's what these are. However, nice packaging, good quality seeds, fresh, and clean of rocks and such. The only thing they might change is to make them organic. (No where on the label does it say this, so I have to think they are not.)I love to just put a tablespoon in a glass, swirl them around and watch them start to gel up. Or, I put them in my morning Greek yogurt mixture and voilá, more nutritional yogurt!Good product. They get extra points for their ever-lovely art work as well.
