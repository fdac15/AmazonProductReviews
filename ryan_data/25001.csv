"I got this keyboard for my office but still use the older Natural Keyboard Elite at home. The older keyboard is much more comfortable and responsive and I really wish Microsoft would bring it back.This keyboard, while more attractive than the older model, is much harder to use. The keys are a lot stiffer and control key commands are slow. On the Elite, you can pretty much press the control key and the alphabetic key at the same time. On this keyboard, you have to hold down the control key a brief moment before you press the other key. If you don't, unexpected errors occur - for instance if, when copying text, you hit the ""C"" key too quickly, it deletes the text and won't paste it when you hit ctrl-V.The function keys can be used for internet scrolling, but since I primarily use my mouse for that, I just find that all the extra keys and functions clutter up the keypad. Plus, the letters are harder to see on a black background, although on the plus side, it doesn't get as dirty as the cream-colored Elite. And while, in theory the strip at the bottom of the keyboard ought to be more comfortable because of the padding, it isn't.I could live with all the other issues if it weren't for the stiffness of the keys and the sluggishness of the response when using ctrl commands.  I'll take the comfort of an ergonomic keyboard over a standard keyboard any day, but it's almost worth paying the exorbitant fees to find an older model just because of how much easier the actual typing is.This keyboard just goes to show that keyboards are, perhaps, like women - just because one is younger and pretty than another doesn't mean it's better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVSZ9V0CZLQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A6PPOK#wasThisHelpful","ROVSZ9V0CZLQE","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an almost perfect little novel, about two unlikely comrades on a quest to find a dozen eggs in Leningrad (fondly called Piter by the characters, for St. Petersburg) during the siege of the city by the Nazis.But if the plot itself is little more than an excuse to take the reader through war-torn WWII Russia, the characters make up for it.  From the narrator, a 17-year old Jewish boy who's been living in the besieged city on his own, to the man he's unwillingly partnered with on his quest, the charming good-looking would-be novelist, Kolya, to the girls forced to do things they never would have done during peacetime.Benioff manages the difficult feat of making you feel the anguish of war and privation without ever being maudlin or melodramatic.  If there's a flaw, it's the unnecessary prologue, but even that is so well-written that it doesn't much take away from Benioff's ability to place us in a time and place worlds apart from our own and make us feel like we know it and the characters almost as well as our own city and loved ones.The prose flows so well you can read this easily in one sitting, but like all good books it stays with you long afterward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUHH7BKVAZACF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452295297#wasThisHelpful","RUHH7BKVAZACF","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This food jar worked great at the beginning, but last night I ran a side by side test of this food jar and a newer (& slightly larger one by Stanley).  At 10:00 p.m. I put water that measured 204 degrees with a Thermapen instant-read thermometer and in both jars and sealed each tightly.  At 9 a.m. (11 hours later) the temperatures read:1.  Smaller food jar - 69 degrees, i.e., room temperature2.  Larger, newer jar - 148 degrees, still above the ""danger zone"" for foods.These jars are supposed to keep food hot for 15 hours.  So while I would trust the newer one for food heated in the morning to still be hot at lunchtime, the smaller one has to be trashed, which is too bad, because it's the perfect size for a side of soup, easy to clean, and the overlid functions as a bowl and is a good size for either sipping or for eating from with a spoon.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HL9LD4VEYLDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019D7AGO#wasThisHelpful","R1HL9LD4VEYLDS","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is purported to do great things for inflammation and digestion.  Can't say I notice a huge difference taking them, but I always notice when taking something is a problem, and there's none here.  No stomach upset, no discolored urine, no nothing.  So I am going to trust the studies that show that it works and keep taking it to see if there's a difference over time.

"The bottle's pretty.  And it's nice to be able to fill water from a fountain if you're somewhere you can't refill your bottle from any other source.  But you have to run water through the filter for 15 seconds and insert it into the built in-straw to activate it, so it's wasteful, plus you have to drink the water through the straw for it even to work.  And you have to replace the filter every couple of months.Oh, and the filter removes the taste and odor of chlorine, but nothing else.  If that's all you care about, I guess this does the trick.But since for a little over a Jackson you can buy a carafe-type filter that will also remove lead and other organic compounds, unless you really need more than one bottle of water at a time from an over-chlorinated, but otherwise safe source (the bottle won't purify water), you're better off buying one of those, or a fixed water filtration system, and a bottle you can pour from or drink out of like a glass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26E4K74F9IEGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB8NOPY#wasThisHelpful","R26E4K74F9IEGI","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Dragon NaturallySpeaking since version 8. Those earlier versions were more trouble than they were worth. Even as late as version 11, I found that I had to go back and retype quite a number of things I had said.With this latest version of Dragon, Nuance Communications has finally gotten the speech recognition right. I find that I need to do relatively few corrections; in fact, so far this review I haven't had to do a single one, a first.The software isn't as good at detecting speech from a digital voice recorder; however, the software is compatible with quite a few of them and it still beats transcribing things by typing them in fully.The software works best when you speak in complete sentences - it has a little more of a problem detecting words correctly when you say them one at a time with no context.There are new and improved options in version 12, such as being able to set the hotkey for starting dictation to sleep, rather than off, when you start the program.I know that some people have said that this option is much slower to print which are speaking onscreen, but I've found the opposite to be the case. This is the first version of Dragon I've used that didn't cause me to inadvertently test how many naughty insults I knew, although it still possible to train Dragon to learn new words and the speech recognition on those is pretty darn good.I can honestly say for the first time that I recommend this program without hesitation. It took me a third of the time to do this review that it would have without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L91XHDQ6FU3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NP76FQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L91XHDQ6FU3V","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After being diagnosed several yeas ago with a severe Vitamin D deficiency, I did a ton of research into the different forms of the vitamin and concluded that oral D3 was likely to be best at bringing up the actual levels in my body and not just the level of measurable vitamin D in the blood (which some sources said prescription high-dose D2 would do).Years later my vitamin D levels are fine and they've stayed that way based on taking between 1,000 and 2,000 mg./day.  At 2,500 mg, the Jarrow Formulas is a little higher than what most people need for maintenance, but not yet getting into the potentially dangerous territory some doctors say results from taking more than 3,000/day for extended periods of time.It's hard to tell whether there's any difference between Jarrow and other brands, but I've taken Jarrow supplements before and find them easy to digest.  Plus, it's considered a safe, reliable brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUY0T7N89UZ1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GL1VGE#wasThisHelpful","RUY0T7N89UZ1T","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If all you want is a straight up digital recorder that fits easily and unobtrusively in a pocket and transfers files easily to a computer this definitely isn't the way to go as there are recorders on the market that are smaller and lighter, albeit at a cost; but this one will still fit into a pocket or purse (though it will be a bit on the bulky side) and it comes with a version of Dragon Naturally Speaking 11 for use with recorders.  As I have Dragon Naturally Speaking 12 premium version, however, I did my testing with that.The pluses:Lots of features for changing recording and playback quality.  Better quality comes at the cost of more space, of course, but you can upgrade to a removable memory card with more space than the 2 GB internal memory, which still has quite a bit of room.Buttons are fairly intuitive which is good, because you have to figure out how to open the manual, which is hidden on the recorder, and pick the right language, and even then it's a bit obtuse.The best part, of course, is its compatibility with Dragon, but you'll still have to do some work because the transcription is far from perfect (see below).You can record in four different qualities of MP3 or in wav format (wav takes up more memory).The unit shuts off automatically (you can change this) if you haven't done anything for several minutes.  You can also set it to record and shut off at set times, and can use it as an alarm clock.You can make it voice activated, useful for those awkward dates or for when you want to know if you talk in your sleep.The buttons are easy to learn by touch, good for those of us with weak eyes.In all pretty useful out of the box, better if you can stand a little time reading the manual.The minuses:Playback volume directly on the recorder is pretty low, but attaching the recorder to a computer is easy and solves the problem.  The included cable is ridiculously short, however, only a couple of inches, but it's the same set up that works with other apps so you might even have a longer one lying around or you can buy one.Now onto what you really want to know, how does it work with Dragon.  Here's a little out of the box try done three ways.  Dictated into the recorder and transcribed with Dragon 12.  Dictated straight into Dragon 12.  Typed straight it.  As you can see the transcribed from a recording was worst, but straight into dragon was pretty good, much better than in the past.  Basically good for backing up notes, or for transcribing when you mostly remember what was said or useit alone for notes and speak clearly in a quiet room.This example was just me in a quiet room talking to a cat on the same table.How the recording was transcribed:Were during the test to see whether this actually works to transcribe my voice so if for instance that were doing interview would this be transcribe falls in Dragon assuming the swirling on the table in front of me and there weren't a lot of noise calyx tested outHow it came out when I dictated it directly into Dragon Naturally Speaking 12 premium version:Sena were doing a test to see whether this actually works to transcribe my voice so if for instance I were doing an interview with this be transcribe of all in Dragon assuming this were like on a table in front of me and there weren't a lot of background noise okay let's test it outWhat I actually said:Xena, we're doing a test to see whether this actually works to transcribe my voice so if, for instance, I were doing an interview would this be transcribable in Dragon assuming this were, like, on a table in front of me and there weren't a lot of background noise.  Okay let's test it out.As you can see, straight into Dragon it's not too far off, but it does lose quite a bit in the recorder.  Not so much I can't clean it up and between the transcription and some tweaking it's fine.  But you'll need to work on it.  No getting around it.  Hopefully it gets better as I do.I'm still pretty happy with it and hopeful it will get better.  All in all, I still expect it to save time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RT9SFOV6GPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093IZOV0#wasThisHelpful","R18RT9SFOV6GPF","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yu's ""How to Live Safely In a Science Fictional Universe"" was one of the most original novels I've read in some time, so I was really excited to read his first published collection of short stories.Unfortunately many of these are ideas in search of a story, and the only one that really sucked me in was Hero Absorbs Major Damage, which might not be comprehensible to anyone who's never played a role-playing game, despite its grander, more universal theme.  That it manages to be funny, sad and moving at the same time is quite an accomplishment.Still, if not everything lives up to that one story, you have to admire a collection that deals with topics as diverse as a zombie on a shopping spree and people who live through others' painful moments so they don't have to. There's more going on here than just clever science fiction ideas, so I have to applaud Yu's efforts at the same time that I wish they weren't so wildly inconsistent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170HZG3GS5C3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307907171#wasThisHelpful","R170HZG3GS5C3H","A3H7ADUP07D93H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H7ADUP07D93H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why this product is supposed to be better for people over 50 and I suspect it's just a marketing tool aimed at the large number of Baby Boomers who have now passed the half century mark.  That said, like regular Glide, this product slides smoothly between the teeth and gets the job done.

"I usually only buy only 100% cotton shirts. I didn’t realize until after I had ordered it that this was a cotton/polyester blend, but when I received the shirt it almost felt like it was all cotton. It had a softness and texture that I was familiar with, so I’m OK with the Oxford NY T Shirt.Usually I take an XL in a shirt depending on where it comes from. Some stores tend to run large, while others definitely require an XXL, especially after washing. If you normally take XL, you will probably want the XXL unless you want a tight fit. I also think that the Oxford NY T Shirt seems to be a little bit on the short side, especially for an XXL. Maybe that is the “Updated modern fit” that the product page refers to.The quality of the shirt is pretty good. The fabric is a little thin, but not too thin. The collar is not flimsy like some other T shirts that I have gotten recently and the stitching seems durable, especially for a shirt at this price. The charcoal heather is nice and dark. Hopefully it won’t fade too much with multiple washings. The shirt must be washed in cold water on the gentle cycle and can by tumbled dry on the low temperature setting.Overall I think the Oxford NY T Shirt is a good value, and is pretty well made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQINNIZG2ZXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXITE7Y#wasThisHelpful","R1AQINNIZG2ZXH","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thermo Pro’s TP-01 Digital Instant Read Thermometer is a perfect addition to anyone’s kitchen. It has a rugged build that won’t break if dropped on the floor, an easy to read LCD display and easy to use controls – On/Off and degrees F/C. Its stainless probe has a skinny tip on the end to easily pierce meat, but the thermometer can be used to measure the temperature of other things too. Its temperature range is from -40 to 302 degrees F or -40 to 150 degrees C. The digital readout has tenth of a degree for accuracy and it takes about 20-30 seconds to get a precise reading, when the temperature stabilizes. I used my analog instant read thermometer to compare the difference in temperature and both came within a degree of each other.The Thermo Pro TP-01 has plastic cover the probe slips into to protect it when not in use. Unlike my analog thermometer it does not have the temperatures for different types of meat printed on this cover, but instead it comes with a booklet with the USDA Recommended internal temperatures. I have a feeling this booklet will get lost pretty quickly in the kitchen. I guess I can look at the other thermometer’s probe cover or on the internet if that happens.The Thermo Pro does not have an auto shut off, so it can accidently be left on if the switch is not turned off. This is probably by design for constant long-term readings. Luckily the battery is easy to replace. There is a place to pry the display off on the side and access the battery, which is the button type like a watch battery (see pics), just be careful of the wires that go down to the probe.The Thermo Pro TP-01 is a good, basic instant read kitchen thermometer that anyone can use. It’s good for the barbeque (after removing meat from the grill), roasts, breads, liquids, etc. It is not designed to be kept in the food while cooking, but to get an internal temperature reading when removed from the heat source. It is not dishwasher safe (none of them are), but just requires a little bit of soap and water on the probe and a quick dry with the towel before storing. The product comes with a 90 Day Warranty. This is a nice device for the price.A free sample product was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FU33443MH0GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IC8YIS#wasThisHelpful","R1FU33443MH0GO","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently started cataloging my music and DVD collection into a database, and the Ruban bar code scanner helps to save so much time and manual inputting of information. There are programs available that will pull in all of the information on the DVD, CD or whatever you scan simply by scanning the barcode. This bar code reader is perfect for that sort of application. It would also be great be great for a small business or light industrial use. Although I feel it is well made, I don’t think it could hold up to the incessant use of a busy supermarket or other high volume application. Those applications require scanning guns costing hundreds more.There isn’t much to setting up the Ruban barcode scanner. Some very minor assembly is required to the stand such as inserting the gooseneck into the plastic sleeve and tightening a screw at the base and another on the holder. Anyone can do that. If necessary, the base could be screwed into a flat surface for stability, or even weights could be glued to the bottom, though if the gun is positioned correctly in the holder with the gooseneck slightly forward it is good enough.The cord on the reader has an Ethernet connector with a large strain relief on one end that plugs into the jack on the gun, the other end is a standard USB connector that plugs into a computer or other peripheral. The Ruban barcode scanner is pretty much plug and play on a Mac or PC. When plugged into a Windows machine it will need to load the driver first which takes about 30 seconds and it is installed. The Mac silently loads the driver, and nothing pops up on the screen when the gun is plugged in. When the barcode reader is plugged in a green light appears on the top and it will beep three times to let you know it is ready. When scanning is taking place the green light will go out, and the red laser turns on and reads the barcode. When the barcode is successfully read the gun will beep and the green light turns back on.There are no “real” instructions for the barcode reader, though it does come with small booklet that gives the specs of the device and settings that can literally be scanned into the barcode reader. For instance, you can scan the barcode for “Continuous Mode” and put the reader into the stand. Then you just need to pass an item underneath and it will scan without pressing the trigger. This is great if there is a ton of items that need scanning. There are also other settings to change the volume and tone of the beep, different types of barcodes, country settings, and communication settings such as baud rate, data bit, parity, etc.The barcode reader can be used on a standard PC basically anywhere that the blinking input cursor is visible. In Word this is what I get when I scan the barcode on the box - X000T4PR6P.  If you scan an item in Google it will bring up information on the product as well as merchants selling it. Other programs such as inventory and point of sale programs will use the barcode reader in their own ways. It is a very versatile device.Prices for barcode readers are all over the map on Amazon. Some are Bluetooth, some are 2.4 GHz with a dongle, some have stands, and some do not. I can’t vouch for any other product than the Ruban bar code reader, but I think it is a well made, scans barcodes quickly, and is comfortable to hold.

"The Porta Source IG800W Portable Invertor Generator is a well-built compact unit. It comes well packed from the factory, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.Before starting the IG800W it needs to have oil added to it. This is probably the hardest thing that needs to be done to operate the generator. In order to check, add or change the oil one of the red panels on the side needs to be taken off by removing four screws. Porta Source provides a Phillips head screwdriver to aid in the removal. Once the panel is removed, just unscrew the cap to the oil reservoir and add the proper amount. The cap has a mini dipstick to check the level. Filling the oil was easy, no funnel was required, and no drips occurred, though I did wipe the area with a rag when finished. Once the oil has been added, gasoline needs to be added to the fuel tank and it is ready to start. Since the generator has a four cycle Viper engine there is no messy mixing of two-cycle oil, it uses 87 octane regular gas or better.There are six easy steps to starting the generator: turns the fuel cap air vent to open, turn the fuel valve switch to on, push the engine switch to run, press the primer bulb six times, move the lever to choke, and pull the starter cord. The generator started on the first try. Once it is started, move the choke lever to run and the IG800W is operational. The generator is pretty quiet and has rubber feet at its base to dampen any vibrations. The IG800W has a single three prong AC plug to plug an extension cord or power strip into. Just remember the running wattage is 700 watts with a maximum of 800 watts, so be sure not to exceed that. If you do, there is a circuit breaker than can be instantly reset once you correct the issue. The motor on the generator will fluctuate based on the amount of power that is needed, which also helps with gas conservation. There is economy mode which also helps to save fuel, but I’m not exactly how yet.The power output of the Porta Source IG800W is clean and steady, unlike my older Coleman 2600 watt generator that has choppy power. The Porta Source has “Pure Sine Wave” circuitry that allows it to power even sensitive electronics without surges and dips in power that could damage them. I did a test and plugged in two lamps next to each other, one in the IG800W and another in an my old Coleman 2600 watt generator and the difference is pretty dramatic. The Coleman would dim and brighten while the Porta Source was just steady on, without any fluctuations.While I haven’t gone camping or had a power outage yet to really use the IG800W, I have a feeling that it will perform really well. Hurricane Joaquin may be heading this way, so I may get to test it out. The Porta Source is built really rugged and I think that it will last, but since it is made in China, you never know. One of things that I like best about the unit is that when you are done using it, you can put it on a shelf in the garage until it is needed again. It comes with a one year for everything but the motor, which has a two year warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KG46EOA47VJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2FOX4C#wasThisHelpful","R2KG46EOA47VJM","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess it depends upon what quadcopter you have if it is worth paying the premium price for the Lowepro Droneguard CS 300. This case is about twice the price of my Syma X5-SW-1. If you have a Parrot BeBop, which is what is shown in the product pictures, then it would be a better option considering that quadcopter runs about $500.I really like the Droneguard 300 CS. The protection is not so much based on padding on the inside of the case, but more on the hard shell case on the outside. Most of the outside of the case has a nice durable canvas like material glued tightly to what I assume is composite plastic shell. The back of the pack has some padding, as well as on the straps to give some comfort to your back and shoulders in case there is a long trek involved to get to the flight area.This case will NOT hold a DJI Phantom or Inspire, or Yuneec Typhoon Q500, it is not deep enough. For larger craft Lowepro makes the CS400, thought that looks like it can only handle a Phantom or 3DR Solo.Inside the case are four movable partitions that Velcro to the bottom of the case so that you can configure it the best way to fit your quadcopter and equipment. The quadcopter is safely secured by Velcro straps that attach to these barriers. There is also an oval barrier that can be made square to hold a transmitter, tools and various other items. The zippered pouch has two removable Velcro barriers just like the case has. This is good for smaller parts, cameras, batteries, etc. The zippered pouch provides a little more additional padding than the case provides. On the inside top of the case has a Velcro removable flat panel with a handle that has many loops to hold props, cables, tools, pens, etc. It has a zippered pocket that will hold a small tablet, papers or manuals. There are also similar nylon loops on the front of the pack as well as a zippered pocket that only goes about half way down and is quite tight. The main zippers have nice lanyard type loops that make it easy to zip and unzip the pack.The Lowepro Droneguard CS 300 is a quality case, though in my case, the Droneguard CS300 is probably better quality than the quadcopter it is protecting. For more expensive drones this case would provide great protection and is probably worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9WC07JVZQ1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CKW0BA#wasThisHelpful","RK9WC07JVZQ1W","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Netsun’s 10 foot Lightning to USB cable looks identical to a genuine Apple cable at a glance. It does not have the Netsun logo on the lightning connector (like in the picture), but does have the USB symbol on the USB connector. Apple does not make a 3 meter cable, but the Apple Store sells one from Belkin for $29.99. For that price you can almost get four of Netsun’s 3 meter cables.The Apple cable feels like it has a slightly thicker wire to it, but visually it’s hard to tell. The cable strains on Apple’s cable near the lightning and USB connectors are a little bit longer and a little bit stiffer, which indicates it probably won’t wear out as fast as Netsun’s cable, but Netsun has a “Lifetime Guarantee”, so if a cable wears out “You will get a free replacement shipped out, with no questions asked” according to the Amazon product page. The only problem is there they don’t tell you how to contact them. They need to provide this information with the product package, which is just a small ziplock bag. Even a small piece of paper inserted in the bag would suffice, or a sticker placed on the back of the bag would work fine. Instead you have to search for the NetSunDirect Customer Service link on the vendor’s storefront. Hopefully their customer service is good, and hopefully they don’t require you to mail the defective cable back to China. If that is the case it’s probably cheaper to just buy another one.I haven’t had any problems or errors while charging or syncing with this cable. Even though it does not state that it is “Apple MiFi Certified” like Belkin or Anker cables it does the job, and connects just fine.Overall Netsun’s 3 meter cable is a good value and works just fine, especially for the price.A Free Sample Product Was Provided To Review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q6CNZR3I9E2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149RWH2S#wasThisHelpful","R1Q6CNZR3I9E2D","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:01 MinsThe Syma X5 SW-1 is a great quadcopter for beginners. That’s good, because that is exactly what I am, having lost one quadcopter that now resides about 65 feet up in my neighbor’s pine tree. It gives me great pleasure to review the latest release from Syma.When you open the box, you can see that it is packaged quite well in a white plastic tray with a clear cover over it. Taped underneath the tray is the phone clip, instruction manual, screwdriver, landing gear and extra battery so be sure to lift the tray out of the box. The manual is written in somewhat of a broken English, a few of the diagrams have labeling errors, but for the most part you can understand what it is saying. Syma provides plenty of pictures and drawings to help you figure things out.There is some minor assembly needed before flying. The four landing gear need to be placed into their holes and screwed in to the underside of the aircraft using the included screwdriver. Flipping the quadcopter over will necessary to accomplish this. There is only one screw per landing gear so it is an easy task. If you want to install the prop guards (beginners will definitely want to do this to save blades), there are two holes that the guards fit in near the props with a screw in the center to keep them in place. Once that is complete the only thing left to do is attach the camera, which slides on the bottom of the battery compartment. You will hear a click. The camera’s cable just needs to plugged into its jack and the Syma X5 SW-1 is just about ready to fly.The quadcopter comes with one battery preinstalled in its battery compartment, which is at the rear, the end with the blue blades. The door is on a hinge and there is a little shelf where the battery rests. Before flying I would recommend charging the batteries with the included USB charger because the flight time is only about six or seven minutes on a full charge and you will be disappointed when the battery is spent after just a few minutes To remove the battery from the Syma X5 SW-1 you need to find the wire and carefully pull the battery connector away from the aircraft connector. The battery then needs to be attached to the USB charger that has the same connector as the quad. There is a light within the USB connector that will go off when the battery is fully charged. It takes about an hour or two depending on the charger. Dedicated USB chargers seem to charge the batteries faster than plugging them into a computer or phone charger. Before the first flight four AA batteries will need to be acquired for the remote control unit, these are not included.Before flying it is necessary to download the Syma FPV app on your tablet or smartphone which allows you to see what the camera sees, record video and take still pictures. There is a clip that mounts to the transmitter’s antenna that you can attach the phone to. The clip sits on nice and tight, and it clamps my iPhone really well. The transmitter itself is pretty light and feels somewhat hollow inside which is good because when you add the weight of the phone in your hand you get tired of holding it. Unfortunately, the transmitter does not have a lanyard hook like some other brands. All of the buttons at the bottom of the transmitter are just molded into the case. They are hard plastic - fake, bogus, and non-functional. There is a small LCD screen that is not backlit and hard to see, especially in the glare of bright sunlight. It basically shows the amount of trim, the speed, the mode (1 or 2), throttle and direction, and the battery strength of the transmitter. Most of the time while flying you won’t be looking at this screen, it really doesn’t help that much. The button on the left side of the transmitter changes the speed (high or low) as well as puts the aircraft into “Headless Mode”, while the button on the right side makes the quadcopter perform 3D Eversions, otherwise known as flips. The 3D Eversion button does not work on my transmitter. When I tried it with a different Syma transmitter it worked, so the problem is not with the flight controller, but probably a wiring issue within the transmitter. It does make a beep when depressed, so it is making contact. In mode 1 (which is the most common), the left stick is throttle and rotate left and right. The other stick controls the angle of attack, which will make it travel in the direction the stick is commanding it go.Flying the Syma X5SW-1 is challenging and takes awhile to get even the basics down (which I am still trying to learn). The good news is this is a very forgiving aircraft. It is stable and virtually indestructible. If it hits an object it bounces off of it without any damage. It can even fall out of the sky from high up and just land on its gear that absorbs the impact. Just avoid the trees. It can easily get caught up in a tree, and if the prop guards are on they grab the branches and hold on until it can be retrieved or a lot of wind comes along to knock it out. The hardest thing to learn about flying a quadcopter is learning the orientation when it is flying towards you where left is right, right is left, and forwards is backwards. The white propellers and different colored navigation lights are supposed to help you out with this. Luckily Syma has a setting out called “Headless Mode” in which the flight controller will figure out the orientation for you and you just point the sticks where you want the craft to go. This is helpful for beginners, but those who want to become pros may want to leave this off and practice, practice, practice flying. I’ve heard that eventually this kicks in and you will get it. So far I have not.The exclusive blue color is easy to see while flying against the clouds and blue sky, but a little less visible when flying closer to the ground. My previous white quad was definitely more noticeable at lower altitudes; nevertheless the blue color is still quite visible in the daytime. The X5SW-1 just disappears in the night sky. The only things visible are the four navigation lights on the bottom.Because this quadcopter is so light weight it has problems flying in winds over 5 mph or so. In high winds you can give the transmitter full angle of attack towards the direction of the wind and the aircraft will just sit there as if hovering rather than travelling in that direction. The higher the altitude the more susceptible it is to winds and also having it fly away by getting caught in a sustained breeze. It is best to make sure that you fly on high speed and have a large enough space to fly the quadcopter especially on a windy day, because it will get pushed further and further away the windier it is. On gusty days it’s best not to fly at all.As a beginner, I find it extremely difficult to fly FPV using the app on my iPhone. I need to have a visual on the aircraft at all times. I have also noticed that there is a significant lag the further away the aircraft is from the transmitter. I know this because after the quadcopter has crashed to the ground it is still flying straight on the app and I can watch it crash on the screen. This lag would cause some issues if only flying FPV like hitting an object before it is visible on the screen. The FPV range is pretty good, luckily the transmitter range is better, so you can bring the SX5SW-1 back into range. If you fly out of FPV range the picture will just freeze until the connection is re-established. Since both the FPV WiFi and the transmitter are on 2.4 GHz frequencies I think they do cause some interference between each other. If I remove the camera the craft seems to fly better at a further distance away from the transmitter (not to mention longer flying time). Other manufacturers (such as DJI) usually separate the controller and FPV frequencies to avoid this issue.Recording video or taking still photos from the Syma X5SW-1 must be done through the Syma FPV app that you load onto your phone or tablet. The aircraft mounted camera does not have a micro SD slot to record on. This is a major flaw with this quadcopter because everything is dependent on the WiFi signal being broadcasted from the moving aircraft. While the signal is usually pretty good, there are times where it freezes up and may ruin otherwise flawless video footage. Besides the camera being dependent on WiFi, the recorded video only ends up at 480 X 360 once it is exported to the phone or tablet from the app, even though it fills the entire widescreen while being viewed in flight. Since there is no gimble the camera is also at the mercy of the aircraft’s movements, but at this price point I would not expect any sort of image stabilization. Obviously this is not videographer’s quad, but someone who just wants to have fun flying, learn how to fly to prepare for a larger aircraft, and get some basic video footage to show their friends.For the price point you really can’t beat the Syma X5SW-1 as long as you realize its limitations. It’s flight range is 50 meters (about 150 feet), the video footage is acceptable, but not great, the FPV has a lag which grows the further it is from the transmitter, the WiFi signal (camera) does interfere a little which makes the range a little bit less, and it cannot fly in windy conditions. For a beginner this is a great quadcopter. It is a nice mid size craft that it very stable and won’t get visually lost in the sky as soon as it is airborne. It makes a great quadcopter for those who want to take learn how to fly, then take the next step and get an aircraft costing thousands of dollars. In many ways the Syma X5SW-1 is harder to fly since it completely manual and needs attention 100% of the time. The more expensive quadcopters have GPS guidance, flight programming, auto take off and landing as well as data telemetry and maps that constantly give you two way feedback. The X5SW-1 has none of that. The only way it communicates with you is by blinking its lights on the craft itself (if you can see them) to tell you the battery charge is about to expire.A sample product was provided for free to review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3QXRBBMGD8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WL9WUC#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3QXRBBMGD8F","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Crabby Digital makes one fine micro USB cable. This is the most distinctive cable that I own. The micro USB connector is very high quality, feels very durable, and is not coming off no matter how hard it is tugged. It is flat so it can easily connect to phones with tight cases. The larger USB connector does not look like any other USB I’ve ever seen. It looks like it would just fall out of the socket, but actually grips it quite well. It must be inserted with the USB symbol facing up. It will not make a connection if inserted upside down. That may be the only flaw I have with this cable. I’ve heard that there are newer connectors of this type that can be inserted either way.The cable itself is a generous six feet long with a strap that can bind up any of it that is unused. The flat cable design prevents tangling, which is always a problem with rounded cables. The wire has a very unique posable quality to it, you can actually make a sculpture out of it if you wanted to. Although this cable has a lifetime guarantee, the address on the box says “(Not a return shipping address)” and there is no other documentation, so Crabby really needs to clarify how this guarantee works. If I have to ship the cable back to China, no thanks. Overall I find Crabby Digital to make a fine high quality cable with unique qualities I haven’t seen in other cables.A free sample product was provided to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PPA8WFYTGX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ68L0E#wasThisHelpful","R11PPA8WFYTGX8","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Teikis Cocktail set makes a good gift for the amateur bartender. While I wouldn’t call this professional quality equipment, it is good enough for the average user.The steel for the jiggers is decent quality, it doesn’t feel like it will dent very easily. They have a polished finish on the outside and a brushed finish on the inside. The double sided 30 and 50 ml jigger is a bartender classic, while the single 25 and 50 ml jiggers are of a more modern design.The glass for the shaker is a bit small in diameter, so it has to fit pretty far into the steel shaker, only allowing a few inches for mixing, but that is probably enough. The fit is not perfect within the shaker and it takes some adjustment to find the right spot where the liquids won’t leak out when shaking, but it does work if placed correctly. The glass is nice and thick with rounded edges at its mouth that help with sealing the mixture in. It has half ounce measurements on the side as well as basic drink recipes for Dry Martini, Daquiri, Margarita, Bloody Mary and Manhattans. The strainer is a tad small for the mouth of the shaker, so some ingredients may get by along the edges, so it’s best to pour at and angle to avoid this.For those who prefer to have their drinks stirred instead of shaken (don’t invite James Bond to your party) there is long bar spoon with a nice twisted design. If you spin it around it sort of looks like a barber pole. The steel is strong and the spoon will not bend or break unless a lot force is used and its destruction is intentional. I like how the other end of the spoon has a flat end so that it can rest on the bar standing straight up.There is a big organic bartending movement going on using fresh ingredients, and the wooden muddler could help out bringing out the flavors in your herbs and fruits. The muddler is ergonomic, feels solid, and has just the right amount of stain and finish to show off its natural elegance.Although the box not specifically state this, I would imagine all but the muddler are dishwasher safe. Teikis has a nice cocktail set for the money, and despite a few issues, this would make a nice gift. It is presented nicely in the box and is decent quality for someone who wants to explore the world of concocting libations.A free sample product was provided to review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ7JPKVC0XPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPX7NO2#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ7JPKVC0XPN","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lancaster Caramel Company was Milton Hershey’s original candy company founded in 1886. Lancaster is an updated version of his recipes 125 years later.The tin is generic in the familiar Hershey’s brown color with a Lancaster logo sticker on the side, but I think that is entirely appropriate considering the simple Amish life of Lancaster, PA. There is also a cardboard sleeve on the top that shows the three different varieties inside, and a sticker on the bottom with the ingredients list and nutrition information.There are three different kinds of candy which all have distinct stripes on the ends of the label, so you can pick out the flavor that you want out at a glance. The plain caramel has a plain wide tan stripe, the Vanilla And Caramel has thin tan stripes with white in between them, and the Butterscotch and Caramel has thin tan, yellowish and white stripes.When you unwrap the candy you notice that it is shiny and has a slightly sticky feel to it. The candies that I received were so fresh and the caramels were so soft. Each flavor obviously has its own unique taste, and I can safely say that I do not have a favorite. I have bought the plain caramels before in the store and liked them a lot. They tasted very similar to Werther’s Chewy Caramels, but a bit better. The Butterscotch and Caramel flavor has the balance just right, not too much or too little Butterscotch flavoring, while the caramel shines through on it’s on merit. The Vanilla and Caramel flavor is creamier than the plain and once again the balance between the caramel and vanilla flavors is just right. They are all just plain yummy and addicting. I had to get the tin out the room just now since I was starting to binge eat them.Like I said earlier the tin I received was so fresh and the caramels were so soft and chewy. I would imagine that this might vary depending on delivery conditions and how long they are warehoused. The texture is so smooth and creamy, these are not like Kraft caramels that have a slight grit and dryness to them. Some might find Lancaster a bit sweet, I can see that, but I think most people will find them just about right. If you are a caramel lover like I am, you will definitely like this Lancaster assortment. The price is also about right considering I pay about $4 for a 4 ounce bag at the store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5KUD3Z2BOQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","R3M5KUD3Z2BOQ2","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TP-Link HA100 Bluetooth Music Receiver is a great versatile product that anyone with older equipment needs to have. Most people have an old set of computer speakers laying around from a long retired desktop computer. You can put them to use with this device and have music in a room that you didn’t have it in before. Another use is to bring older stereo equipment up to date giving it Bluetooth capability. I have an older Denon receiver that does not have Bluetooth, Airplay or even HDMI capability. With the TP-Link HA 100 I now have the capability to listen to the music on iPhone and home media server through the Plex app on the phone. Welcome to the 21st Century old stereo! This device can even give Bluetooth music capability in the car. You will need a USB to car power adapter, and your car’s stereo would need an AUX input for this to work, but it is totally doable, it worked on my old Pioneer car receiver without an issue. Of course you will have to control the music from the phone itself, so it is not exactly handsfree. The unit is so flexible it will plug into any audio device that has either a stereo 3.5 mm jack or RCA jack input.I’ve been using another Bluetooth receiver on a set of old computer speakers, the Avantree Roxa which does the same thing as the TP-Link HA100. While the sound is every so slightly warmer than the HA100, the range on it is terrible. That is not the case with the TP-Link Bluetooth receiver, the range is phenomenal for any Bluetooth device that I’ve ever used. TP-Link claims the range is 66 feet. I would say it is at least that. I was able to go downstairs to the kitchen in the house, which is the furthest point away from unit that I could get without going outside the house. The Avantree Roxa would breakup if I just stepped out of the room.The TP-Link HA100 is so easy to setup. Just attach the USB cord to a USB port or to AC power with the included adapter, then either plug in the RCA cables (White is left and TRed is Right) or the 3.5 mm jack to the input of your speakers or receiver and the other end of the cable to the output of the Bluetooth Music Receiver. For some reason the left and right channels are reversed on my unit, or the wiring of the RCA cord is, and I had to plug the red plug in the left channel and the white plug in the right channel to get the correct phase. Next, the device should have a white LED on the front that indicates it is in pairing mode. Search your Bluetooth listing for TP-LINK MUSIC and connect to the unit. Pairing instructions vary by Bluetooth device, so follow the instructions included with the phone or tablet you are trying to pair. Android devices can pair by NFC, but I only have an iPhone and cannot test how this function works.The audio quality of music files vary greatly, most are compressed .mp3 files. When the audio files are played over Bluetooth they are compressed even more to allow for streaming. Some sound quality is sacrificed at the expense of convenience. You will never get audiophile quality over compression, but you can get some really good sounding audio if the original file is sampled correctly. The TP-Link sounds really great. There is good bass and a clear, crisp high end. It comes very close to the Avantree Roxa in sound quality, with the Roxa providing an ever so slightly warmer sound, but the incredible range of the HA100 would definitely make me recommend TP-Link’s Bluetooth receiver.

Until that time a surge protector is just another place to plug in your equipment.The Woods Multimedia Surge Protector can handle up to 1000 Joules, the lowest range of what Woods calls their “Extra Protection” tier of 1,000-1999 Joules, which is the amount of energy that the device can absorb when activated. Woods offers a $150,000 connected equipment warranty protection, which isn’t bad. The average person will have not have gear nearing that value attached to this power strip. The maximum power that this unit can handle is 1800 watts. The EMI / RFI noise filtration will block some WiFi range extenders and home automation equipment modules.The Woods Surge Protector is made of a medium grey brittle plastic with a cheap feel to it that seems like it could break somewhat easily if dropped on a hard floor, I won’t be performing this test to find out though. It has coax protection in case a spike comes through the cable or satellite wire and not the AC power. This would protect your cable set top box as well as your connected TV. All six outlets have sliding safety covers so that young children cannot poke things into the openings and risk possible electrocution. Each outlet is evenly spaced, so the big brick type adapters plugged into the power strip may cover up more than one plug. There is a lighted red on/off rocker switch on the side, and red surge and green ground status LED’s on the front. The four foot cord has a right angle plug, which is better than those 45 degree plugs some surge protectors have. Overall there is nothing special about the Woods Surge Protector, but there is nothing bad either (except maybe not having more space for larger brick adapters). The $150,000 connected equipment warranty offers a sense of security for the cheap price of this device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12QYE3V6SMWDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","R12QYE3V6SMWDO","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can't beat this sunshade for the price. The outside is made of a durable faux leather, while the inside has a microsuede feel to it . There are 48 suction cups in the rear that stick to the back of your phone to hold the shade in place. The shape is held together with two velcro strips on each side . When you unfasten the velcro, the sunshade lays flat like in the picture. There is enough clearance so that the clip can hold the phone, while the suction cups suck onto the back of the phone to hold the sunshade in place. I am using an iPhone 6 , but there may be enough clearance inside the shade to fit an iPhone 6 plus or the Android equivalent. You don't only have to use this sunshade for the DJI Phantom. Any FPV with a phone clip should work. I am using mine with a Syma X5-SW and it works fine. I highly recommend this FPV Cellphone Monitor Sunshade.One more thing, the price range on this product is crazy. I've seen the exact same product from another vendor for $50 - a far cry from the under $5 I paid (with free shipping). So look around for the best price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1NSUPDBVZB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXD33EI#wasThisHelpful","R1V1NSUPDBVZB5","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earlier in the season I borrowed my brother’s gas powered Troy-Built power washer to clean the deck, porch sidewalk house, etc. I found that experience to be less than extraordinary. The washer was noisy, the gas fumes were smelly and the exhaust burned my foliage when I used it near the house. Sure it was a little bit more powerful, but I wasn’t stripping paint or any heavy-duty use like that.The Briggs And Stratton Powerflow Pressure Washer was really easy to put together. Basically, you attach the handle with some bolts, then attach the hoses and spray gun, and you are all set. The manual says that you need to lubricate the O-Rings and connections to the high pressure hose, nozzle extension, and spray gun, but a quick feel indicated that this was done at the factory already. The manual states to use the lubricants sparingly, a light film is all that is required, and that is what I felt, so there was no need to apply any more.Connecting the hoses is simple. On one side of the unit you connect your garden hose, on the other side you connect the high pressure hose. To the high pressure hose you connect the spray gun and to the spray gun you connect the nozzle extension, where you connect the 7 in one nozzle. Once the hoses are connected, water supply is turned on and GFCI is tested, it’s time to turn the unit on. The master switch is on the bottom front of the washer and will begin pressurizing as soon as the switch is thrown, then the noise will stop – unlike a gas washer where the idle noise is continuous and gets louder when in use.There are seven settings on the unique 7 in one nozzle, three high pressure modes (Maximum, General, and Gentle) and four high flow modes (Fan Spray, Fan Spray With Soap, Extended Reach – for second story cleaning, and Extended Reach With Soap). The nozzle is very convenient and easy to turn. There is also an extra red nozzle that is the “Red High Pressure Nozzle” which gives the most cleaning power. I didn’t have a reason to use this one yet. The 7 in one nozzle comes in quite handy. When I was using my brother’s power washer that had four or five separate nozzles. I dropped one of them into the ivy when I was switching it, and it took awhile to find it. The 7 in one nozzle prevents losing any nozzles because there is no need to take it off, just turn it to the desired setting.Operation of the unit requires pushing in a safety switch, then pulling the trigger on the spray gun. Pressing the safety switch each time you want to pull the trigger gets old fast. It is a horizontal switch in an awkward place that you have to push in, and requires some force. On the other hand, those who have kids will be grateful the unit has this switch. I can’t see a young kid being able to push this safety in.When you press the trigger on the spray gun (after pressing the safety) the pressure washer kicks in. It sounds like a vacuum cleaner when the motor turns on, and it wasn’t nearly as loud as my brother’s gas powered unit. I used the unit without soap and was amazed at how well it cleaned the green mold off of the side of the house without anything but water. Normally I would scrub and scrub and scrub with bleach to remove the green, and even that didn’t remove it all and required a lot more work.The next thing I cleaned was the concrete area in front of my garage, which turned green with algae, mold or whatever. I was amazed at the results. The concrete looked clean and refreshed. It looked even whiter once it dried. I was impressed.On another occasion using the unit I cleaned up some pavers, a stone birdbath and even my car’s tire rims also with great results. Next time I will wash the entire car and try the soap tank out.There isn’t much to the cleanup of this machine. First shut it off, unplug it from AC power and turn off the water supply. Next shoot out any pressurized water from the unit and remove the water supply hose, then remove the high pressure hose and remove the hose spray gun remove the 7 in one nozzle from the spray gun and remove the nozzle extension. Everything needs to wiped down with a damp cloth including the unit. The unit needs to be turned on each side side for two minutes to empty any remaining water. There are holders on the sides that both the spray gun and nozzle extension snap into for storage as well as spot in the middle of the tray to store the 7 in one nozzle. The “Red High Pressure Nozzle” needs to stored on the end of the nozzle extension wand. That is something that annoys me since it is small and bound to get lost when I have to take it off the wand and replace it with the 7 in one nozzle, which will be used most of the time. It’s almost like when the unit was designed they forgot to include a place to hold this nozzle, then after the unit went into production someone in a meeting said to just store on the end of the extension rather than to correct the mistake. The AC power cord storage hook is too small for the amount cord plus the heavy GFCI, it needs to stick out further and be a little bit longer. I think there should also be a spot where the GFCI should snap into on the side of the handle to prevent it from dropping to the ground when moving or storing the washer. Hose storage is a little bit better, though after the initial use you will never get the tight curl that it came with and will get tougher to hang on the hook the more it is used.While I wouldn’t use this unit for marine or any heavy duty cleaning, it is fine for general household cleaning. I liked my experience with the electric unit much better than my brother’s gas power washer. It serves my needs just fine, and if I need to strip paint or something like that I will borrow my brother’s again, but for me the Briggs & Stratton Powerflow+ is a really nice unit. I still have a lot more to clean with it, and so far I have not run into any of the issues that others have had. I highly recommend this power washer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBL6MS9A1CI81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZE7J3S#wasThisHelpful","RBL6MS9A1CI81","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Mobilink Intelligent Charger does a great job charging all of my devices. I don’t have an Android phone or tablet, so was not able to test the Quick Charge 2.0 jack, but it is backwards compatible and can be used like a regular SmartUSB charging jack. I have connected my iPhone, wireless keyboard, my GPS, Bluetooth Speakers, and even my Syma quadcopter batteries all at the same time to the Mobilink and it charges them all quicker than their standard chargers. The plastic housing is heavy and durable and doesn’t feel like it would shatter if dropped on the floor or a hard surface like some other products that I’ve tried. The ABS+PC fireproofing shell provides some peace of mind if for it shorted out for any reason, but the charger seems very well built, so I don’t think that is very likely.  The unit can be used while travelling without a transformer with its automatic 100-240V  voltage switching, and the 6 foot AC cord has Velcro so you can make the cord a desired length, which is nice if you have a short cord run. The only thing that I would have like to have seen on the Mobilink Intellegent Charger are LED status lights for each port so that you could tell at a glance if a plugged in device was charging, almost done, or finished charging. With a two year warranty, Quick Charge 2.0 and 100% Money Back Guarantee you cannot go wrong with this device.I was provided a free sample product for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTDI9JC5DS9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01184JGYC#wasThisHelpful","R3RTDI9JC5DS9I","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing that I can say about Sony’s BDPS6500 Blu-ray Player is that the picture quality is absolutely stunning. The Triluminos technology lives up to the hype. Although I currently don’t own a 4K television, I would imagine the 4K upscaling would be excellent as well, but I will have leave that analysis for someone else. The audio quality is also pretty spectacular. I am using the coax digital output rather than HDMI, since my receiver is a little bit dated and does not have any inputs of that type. One quick note, this device lacks optical audio output and composite (analog) jacks, make sure your audio system will accept HDMI or digital in if you plan on connecting it to surround sound.Sony has gone to a minimalist style following their diamond cut series of Blu-Ray players. There are only two buttons (power and open/close), a green power LED and a USB port on the front of the unit – no display at all. The unit sure packs a lot of features into a box that is smaller than my recently upgraded cable set top box (in fact it rests on top of it - making sure I am not covering up any vent holes of course). Sony has created a nice flagship Blu-Ray player here, although it does have a few quirks.One of the quirks of the BDPS6500 has to do with self-burned data discs containing .mp4 files. The player had no problem seeing the files on the disc and then no problem playing them for about a minute or less. After that, the machine mysteriously just stops playing the file, reboots showing the Blu-Ray splash screen, and then shuts off (The LED goes out). It did not seem to matter what data disc I put in, every one did exactly the same thing. Strangely enough, the exact same files are on a home media server and play fine while streaming (More on that later). For the minute that I was able to play the data discs, the playback quality was superb. The video was crystal clear, the colors were vibrant but accurate and the audio was crisp. Any self-burned disc in DVD format did not have this issue, they played just fine - looking and sounding great.Another quirk I found had to do with DNLA and my media server. When I chose my server, then Videos >> TV Shows >> All Shows >> (Folder With TV Shows name) many of the folders would display “No Playable File In This Category”, but when I selected  “By Folder” and a few other categories, the program played just fine, with no problems. I usually use a Plex client (I currently use it with Roku and my iPhone) and everything works fine through that wonderful system. For this device, Plex is still in Preview through the Opera store. Once it is out of preview I will solely be using it for local streaming, so this will be a non-issue fairly soon. Since there is a workaround to play these files, it’s really not much of a problem anyway.Finally, the last quirk I will mention is that after a couple of days of not being used the Blu-Ray player has the tendency to lose its internet connection and give itself a self-assigned IP address. When this happens, the only way to resolve that issue is unplug the unit for about thirty seconds and plug it back in. At that point, your home network’s DHCP server will assign it a legitimate IP address on your network and re-establish the internet connection. No matter how many times I tried to reconnect from the network settings on the unit I could not get rid of the bogus self- assigned IP. Unplugging it is the only thing that did the trick. Perhaps this has to do with a power saving feature, or needs to be addressed with the next firmware issue, I don’t know.The BDP6500 plays DVD’s and Blu-Rays just great, I couldn’t be happier with the playback from them. It streams Netflix with stunning clarity. The colors were vivid and audio clarity was excellent. The Wi-Fi connection is rock solid (when it does not have a self-assigned IP), Netflix did not buffer once while watching a movie, of course a decent router helps here as well. One thing that puzzles me is why Sony did not put a 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi radio or Gigabit Ethernet in this brand new player. You would think that they would be outfitting the latest 5.0 GHz AC band technology rather than relying on the old 2.4 GHz n band. The same goes with the Ethernet. Most people have Gigabit routers installed these days, so why wouldn’t this player come with that. It certainly can’t cost that much more for these components.Besides Netflix, Sony has pre-installed several apps to the intuitive home page including Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, Pandora, YouTube, and a few more, with the ability to add many apps of your choice. Several of the apps require an account or a paid subscription. The Pandora app had a flat boring look to it and for some reason it took several minutes to load the next song providing long gaps of silence between tunes. On some stations the next song never did load, and I had to go back to the home screen and re-launch the app. My six year old Panasonic Blu-Ray player does a better job at Pandora playback, with much quicker song loading. The You Tube app was a much better experience. It loaded quickly, is laid out nicely, and is easy to search for videos. The picture and audio quality varies based on the quality of the original video, but the BDP6500 does its absolute best to upscale and provide the greatest experience possible. 1080p videos look awesome, and there is no buffering. Many of the other apps are for international viewers or of specific interests – gadgets, kids, sports, etc. The apps vary in quality and content, some are done well, while others are terrible. The Flixster app does not allow the user to log in and watch the Ultraviolet content they may have on their account, so to me that is disappointing. The Opera web browser app can be slow and clunky. It is sometimes very hard to read and many videos won’t play on it. You will inevitable reach for your phone’s browser over this one, but I guess it’s ok.Speaking of your phone, Sony has a really nice iOS or Andorid app called TV Sideview, which will turn your phone into a nice multifunctional remote for the BDP6500 that has a trackpad and keyboard, and all of the physical remote functions as well. TV Sideview also incorporates a nice TV Guide with recommended programming and a DNLA controller that will even turn on the player if it is shut off. Since we are talking remotes, the physical remote that comes with this unit is pretty nice. It’s small but fits nice in your hand and everything is within easy reach of your thumb. There is a dedicated Netflix button that brings you right to that app and a Favorites button for which you can assign favorite apps. There are controls to turn your TV on and off, change the volume and input. You don’t have to have a Sony TV; you can enter a specific code based on the brand.One thing I am not, and that is a gamer by any means, but Sony’s BDP6500 IS! Sony provided my with a Dualshock 4 Game Controller and a month’s subscription to Playstation Now to test out the gaming aspect of the device and all I can say is WOW! All of the games that I played streamed like a charm with 1080p graphics and what appeared to me to be full surround sound. They were smooth and so detailed! Too bad I stunk at everything that I played except maybe Wheel Of Fortune. I’m going to have to let a gamer discuss Playstation Now in more detail, but as far as I can see it works great. One thing I don’t like about it is that the controller cannot be used wirelessly. It must physically be connected via USB cable to the Blu-Ray player. That may turn off some true gamers.One final word on the BDP6500, and that is Sony got the CD player right! When you insert a CD into this machine it searches the Gracenote database, correctly finds the CD and retrieves the track names and cover art and plays the CD just like a streaming player would. This is much better than some older players, which just gave “CD Track 1” as the information on the screen. The audio from the CD also sounds great. Well done Sony.Pros:Nice Picture QualityGreat Audio QualitySmall FootprintDVD’s and Blu-Ray playback is fast and flawlessNetflix plays back with stunning quality (when in HD) – no bufferingNice You Tube appOpera Store App adds the possibility of many more apps including PLEX media player (currently in PlexPass Preview)Excellent iOS and Android remote app with DNLA controller and Program GuideNice Remote control – feels good in the hand, and has on/off volume and input controls for multiple TV brands (not only Sony).Playstation Now streams games without a Playstation console (game controller not included)Excellent CD playback with cover art and track names – looks like a streaming playerCons:Problems playing .mp4 files on data discsDNLA is temperamentalSometimes loses internet connection when not used for daysLacks 5.0 GHz WiFi and AC Protocol – only has 2.4 GHz n bandLacks Gigabit EthernetThe Grey, flat Pandora app sometimes leaves long gaps of silence between songs.Opera Web Browser is slow and clunkyGames Controller needs to be attached to unit by USB cable – cannot connect wirelessly","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298HQFQL94OV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6AGWRQ#wasThisHelpful","R298HQFQL94OV8","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teikis has a pretty nice measuring set here. The measuring cups have a matte finish and are made of heavy, durable stainless steel that won't get dinged if they are dropped. The flat bottom makes sure that they won't tip over while you are measuring. I like that they have straight sides and are not taped like my current set of measuring cups. The only weak point I see is where the handles are welded onto cups, they are not all one solid piece of metal. Teikis also includes a 3/4 cup measuring cup which a lot of sets do not have, yet a lot of recipes call for. Be sure to wash the measuring cups before using them since there appears to be specks of black debris from processing in spots. The cups are dishwasher safe.The measuring spoons are nice. They are also made from durable stainless that cannot be bent easily, unlike my current set of spoons. The polished finish makes sure your measurement slides out easily. Each spoon has the measurement stamped into the handle, it is easy to see and won't wash off. The spoons are dishwasher safe.While I like its straight, untapered sides, the glass measuring cup is a little bit peculiar. The first thing you notice is that it does not have any CUP measurements which is the standard for US cooking, only ounces and milliliters, with a 1/2 liter marking above the ounce markings (which I find a little strange - why mix US measurements with metric?). When I'm cooking, I don't want to do any unnecessary converting. The markings are easy enough to read and appear to made of the same material as my old liquid measuring cups, which in time wears off with washing. Although the glass seems pretty thick, and has that greenish tint around the edges, the company does not tell you exactly what kind of glass it is and what it can take. Is it Pyrex? Tempered? Is it Microwave safe, Oven Safe, etc.? It's a mystery. The only thing they print on the outside of the box is that it is dishwasher safe. That's good, just not good enough. We need to know a little more. I would be afraid of it shattering with any amount of heat applied to it.Teikis provided a free sample product for this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY54LHR647DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SABJXJA#wasThisHelpful","R3HY54LHR647DB","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Imogen Studio’s +CAM Pro is wireless network camera designed for monitoring your home, business or property from a remote location. Lately, a growing number of these cameras have popped up including Belkin’s WeMo camera, Nest’s DropCam. D-Link’s Cloud Cam, just to name a few.Setting up the camera is similar to setting up a WeMo device. First download the free iSecurity + app and turn on the Wi-Fi setup switch. The camera will emit its own WiFi signal that you attach your device to, then start the app and it will detect the camera. Next it searches for your home’s Wi-Fi and asks for the password. This connects the camera to the internet using the iSecurity/Seedonk app that you must register for in the next step, creating a login.After successfully logging in you are at the main window where you can see the cameras that were configured during the setup. If you tap that camera the app tries to connect to the camera, however I’ve had mixed results with the app connecting each time. Usually the camera connects right away on the local network, but not always. Sometimes there is a delay and sometimes it does not connect until you try to connect again. There does not seem to be any specific reason why it won’t connect. For example I was at my brother’s house (he has no firewall) on his Wi-Fi and could not connect at all try after try, while at the local Home Depot it connected right away on their Wi-Fi. By default the audio from the camera is turned off once the connection is established. It can be turned on by tapping the speaker button on the control panel at the bottom of the screen. There is also a microphone icon you tap on it to talk allowing two-way conversation, and icons to record photos and video of what you are seeing which are saved in “Photos” on the iPhone for later viewing.While the Product Description on Amazon’s page indicates that this camera can run in 640x480 or 320x240, at up to 30 fps resolution, The specs below that indicate that the sensor’s resolution is 1600x1200 with 720p video quality and electronic pan, tilt and zoom controls (which don’t seem to exist anywhere in the app). The box and limited documentation do not contain any specifications either, so Imogenstudio is making things incredibly confusing by not providing the correct information.In any event, there are no settings to change the resolution or capture rate and nothing to indicate what resolution you are actually viewing. Any stills or video that was captured from the screen shows up with a resolution of 320X240 with the video at 8.4 fps, so you are getting pretty low quality. The video has a slightly soft focus to it rather than being crisp and sharp and colors are fairly muted and not realistically saturated. I would imagine that a highly compressed picture is the reason for this.The night vision capability is about average for a camera of this price, though I put on the auto setting I still found turned it on in a room full of bright sun. For all of these reasons I would only use this as a casual monitoring camera and not for any real security purposes.The app to view the camera is similar to other apps for cameras of this type. You can view, record video, take snapshots, listen to audio, and talkback through the camera’s built in speaker. The app has the ability to share your cameras with friends who have to register with iSecurity+ and create their own login. This will send them a link to view their camera on a Flash enabled web browser. The “Events” button allows you to see motion activated “Events” detected by the camera in the form of a video clip.  Under the camera’s settings there is a Motion Sensitivity setting as well as a Phone Notification switch that can get annoying, because it constantly goes off when motion is triggered.  Likewise, there are several video clips recorded every time a notification is sent. Each video is time and date stamped. There is no way to select videos to delete either. Each one has to be sent to the trash individually, which is a pain. iSecurity+ allows the storage of all events for one day for free, which can be saved to Photos on the iPhone for those who don’t want to pay $9.99 a month for 14 day event retention. The camera comes with a 30 free trial to test this service out.One thing that is not mentioned anywhere in the product’s description is that there is also a web interface at app.isecurityplus.com  which allows users to see their camera’s video from the web in case their phone is unavailable. While the web interface is not as robust as the app, it does provide some basic settings.My overall impression with imogenstudios +CAM Pro is favorable, but it needs improvement all around. A camera that only has a resolution of 320x240 with an 8.4 fps frame rate is pretty useless these days. Why are the colors washed out and the focus a little soft? How come I can log in sometimes and not other times? I hope the makers of +CAM Pro will look at these issues, figure out the actual resolution that the camera really is, and hopefully make it a better experience for the user. The camera is fine to check on your pet throughout the day, see if the kids are home from school, or just look at an empty room, but it should be cheaper.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGV469RGZ7NI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV84FYA#wasThisHelpful","RGV469RGZ7NI4","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like black teas. Probably my favorite every day tea is PG Tips from England. I also prefer Assam and Ceylon teas, as well as Darjeeling and blends like and Irish and English Breakfast teas, and a nice Chai. Most of the time I enjoy my tea with milk and sugar and I steep the teas just slightly beyond the recommended times to assure that they are strong enough, but not bitter. I’m not too fussy about the tea estate, the flush, production date, and its grading because I can’t afford the high end teas where that really matters. All I care about is taste.Capital Teas Breakfast Organic Tea has a nice robust aroma upon opening the zipper resealable plasic pouch, almost like a spicy smell to it. The leaves are small to medium in size and require an average amount to get a nice brew. For a small Brown Betty pot I generally use three small spoons of tea – one for each cup and one for the pot. Following the instructions I heated my water to about 195 F and brewed for about five minutes.This organic breakfast tea steeped up to a nice color, dark enough to take milk and sugar. Sometimes teas come out looking (and tasting) weak no matter how much tea is added, or how long it sits. Capital Teas Breakfast Organic smells nice, but the early spicy aroma is now gone and it has smells more like a Keemun than anything else Now let’s give it a taste.Yes, to my palate there is a strong Keemun and slight Darjeeling flavor. The Dimbula component is generally mild but offers some astringency. There is some Assam flavor, but it is in the background, which is surprising based on the tea’s description, that lead’s one to believe it is its main component giving it “a thick malt and full-bodied character.”Overall I find Capital Teas Breakfast Organic to be pretty good. It has a nice balanced flavor that steeps to a medium-strong cup and stands up to milk and sugar without a fight. At nearly eleven dollars for four ounces (at the time of review), it’s not exactly cheap, but it’s not the most expensive either. I guess it’s close to being competitive to David’s Tea or Teavana (now owned by Starbucks). If you can afford it I don’t think you would be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T65NZEIHGWMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK34DJG#wasThisHelpful","R3T65NZEIHGWMD","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"303 ProtectsAs a convertible owner good rubber seals around the roof, doors and windows are a matter of leaking or staying dry, so I tried 303’s Rubber Seal Protectant. My car is pretty old and the rubber was starting to get a little bit grey and lose some of its elasticity. Once I applied this product I instantly saw the rubber get a little bit darker and get more supple. Sure when it is applied it is wet, so will look darker, it dries lighter than the color that it goes on, but that was still better than the untreated rubber.The application is easy. First you want to clean the seals with a wet or damp cloth to clean them, and wait for them to dry. Next, shake the bottle well and touch the rubber seal with the felt applicator while gently squeezing the bottle. You can control the amount of the product that comes out by pressure of the squeeze that is applied. It is very similar to applying liquid shoe polish to shoes. The applicator is pretty precise and gives you a good amount of control where the product will go. It even has a pleasant smell when applying it. Once all of the rubber seal surfaces are covered you can wipe up any excess with a clean towel and let the 303 Rubber Seal Protectant dry, which does not take long at all.I have a squeaky window where the rubber seal meets the glass in the back of the car. I’m sure hoping that this will help if not eliminate that issue. I’ll let you know after I have driven around. If it does help I will apply it every 3-5 weeks as recommended by the manufacturer.Update: My window chatter has completely disappeared. It looks like I will be re-applying the product in 3-5 weeks!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUAFCGETTPKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T44D1R2#wasThisHelpful","RKUAFCGETTPKA","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon has lumped the reviews for multiple colors and sizes into one bundle, so be careful that the review you are reading corresponds to the product you are interested in.Belkin cables are great. They are made well, and sometimes cost a little more than other cables, but usually provide a good warranty and stand behind their products. This review is for the Mixit Gold Lightning to USB Cable – 4 feet or 1.2m in length. It comes with a two-year warranty, which is better than Apple’s warranty for their 1meter cable – that only has one year.The cable has a retro mid century modern feel with what feels to be a beige braided fabric covering (probably nylon) that compliments the connectors that are painted gold to match the color of the gold iPhone. The connectors seem solid and durable and feel like they will last for years. The four-foot length is perfect for me. The Apple cord that came with the iPhone was just too short for where I am charging it, and I have pulled the plug out of the wall accidently while looking at the phone. This length is the perfect size. It doesn’t hang down on the floor, yet allows me to look at the phone while charging without yanking the cord out of the wall socket.Because this cable is MiFi Certified, you shouldn’t get any messages saying that it won’t work on your device. I have been using it for weeks without any issue, and I highly recommend Belkin’s mixit Lightning to USB cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKG6V5M8DORN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVY0SAY#wasThisHelpful","R2QKG6V5M8DORN","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:28 MinsThis is my first attempt at flying anything remotely, and as a beginner I am crashing more than flying right now. The Syma X5SW seems to take any crashes! Learning how to fly is a bit trickier than I thought, but the craft does seem to be quite stable, and I'm sure after a bit flying the X5SW will be a breeze. The most important thing as a beginner is to fly in a clear area. I haven't and that is my fault. So far I have got the copter caught in trees, almost hit the house, and came close the the power line, which I think would just make the craft drop. It just goes to show you how much the X5SW can take. Due to the limited space I haven't taken it up high yet for fear that I'd never get it back, but I'm going out to a field soon and I think that will vastly improve my skills and allow me to fly a lot higher. Since my main concern was not hitting things I never really glanced down at the FPV screen while flying. Once I am more relaxed and more skilled that will be cool to fly by. I have recorded videos on the phone, which are only 640 X 480. The quality is just OK, not great, but for the price I wasn't expecting anything cinematic. The camera does not come with an SD card slot, it records directly onto the smartphone from the wi-fi connection, so you are not going to get really high quality from the camera. If your aim is to just have fun and shoot some aerial shots, not minding some latency, than this is a good quad for you. If you are a photographer, I'd check out a different quad. Syma's X5C-1 has a better camera with an micro SD slot, but no FPV display and is cheaper than the X5SW. Overall I am pleased with the Syma X5SW, it is stable, and a good beginner quad at a good price.UPDATE: I went to the local school field where I had some room to fly this quad. At first it was dropping out of the sky and not responding to my commands, but after flying it more and more I became more comfortable with the controls and am flying it much better now. The most confusing part of flying is knowing whether the craft is coming or going, so you can adjust the controls accordingly, or just fly in headless mode and the quad will figure it out for you. Syma has updated the software of the camera and it should record in 720p, but I'm not seeing that, but it does give widescreen while flying at least. The video freezes occasionally and is not as good as having an on board SD card. Syma needs to make a camera that can provide FPV as well as record onto an SD card at the same time rather than relying on only the WiFi connection. That would really make this a good quad. I would recommend getting something like this before upgrading to a DJI Phantom or Inspire to practice before you end up crashing and wasting a lot of money.2nd Update- I think that there is definitely a problem with my transmitter. I think that there is a dead spot in my throttle, since the throttle kept stopping and the craft would drop out of the sky, restarting about half way down, almost hitting the ground.Yesterday I flew it and it was not responding to my commands to turn and ended up 50 feet in a tree, where it currently resides until a big wind hopefully will bring it down. The batteries on the controller are reading full,and the quad was not far enough away to be out of range.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GWHVJ3ANNLCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7CTMH0#wasThisHelpful","R3GWHVJ3ANNLCJ","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tacwise Z3-140 Heavy Duty hand stapler is a nice upgrade from the classic Arrow T50 stapler that has been around since the 1950’s that your father and grandfather probably used. The orange plastic handle looks great and is much easier on the hands than the old steel one. The bottom portion is a nice looking silver powder coated metal. Overall this is a very durable unit and unless it is dropped from ten stories up (or more), would probably take any abuse you could give it.Loading the Tacwise Z3 is a breeze. Inserting the staples is so much easier than the old Arrow models. It’s just an action of turning over the stapler, squeezing two tabs and pulling the magazine towards you. Then, place the staples in the slot created by the magazine’s absence and putting the magazine back in place. No more dealing with that spring loaded metal thing that shoots across the room if it is not securely fastened that Arrow had.The operation of this stapler is smooth and requires less effort to drive the staples in than the Arrow T50. Your hand and arm will be thanking you for using the Tacwise Z3-140 later in the day. There is a power adjuster that the manufacturer recommends to switch when driving larger 10mm+ fasteners. The Tacwise Z3 can also drive nails and headless pins (or brads) so it is extremely versatile. I plan on using it soon to replace many torn screens in the summer porch. The magin edge adjuster looks useful. It allows stapling in a nice straight line that is adjustable for almost the entire length of the unit. There is a belt clip, and little clear window with a label where you can write your name or place an identifying mark. When not in use there is a handle lock down feature so the kids can’t shoot their eye out (Yes, A Christmas Story reference).The Tacwise Z3-140 is a quality product made in England, NOT China, and the craftsmanship shows. I highly recommend it! For The price, you can't find anything made this nicely anymore. Tacwise provides a one month money back guarantee on its product, and a three year standard warranty if it becomes defective. There is even a Product Advice and Technical Support number that at present is UK based, but there is also an email address that maybe helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37J996TAVM6JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406WX1O#wasThisHelpful","R37J996TAVM6JZ","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cable that comes with any USB hard drive is an awkward length. It feels like it should either be a little longer, or a little shorter. The Belkin three foot USB 3.0 cable solves that issue. Now, the cable length feels right and allows the placement of either close or distant on the desktop.Belkin has made a quality cable here. It’s about twice the thickness as the cable that originally came with the external hard drives, which is what I would guess allows it to supply 50% more power to the device. Belkin does not claim the cable is any faster, just that it supplies more power to the drive. The connectors are really solid and have raised bumps that grip your fingers when attaching or removing it.The cable was tested on both Seagate and Western Digital External USB 3.0 hard drives and worked well on both, but I did not see any noticeable difference in transfer speed from the manufacturer supplied cable. Although I don’t have one, this Micro-USB 3.0 cable can also be used to charge certain Android phones like the Galaxy series. Belkin provides a two year Limited Warranty on this cable.While I am not taking off any stars off of my review for this, it is necessary to note that Belkin is charging a premium price for this cable, so price comparison based on quality is recommended before purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVMW7MN5IVO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERDGQD6#wasThisHelpful","R1JVMW7MN5IVO0","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No / No Wild Bird Feeders stand for No Wood/ No Plastic. On the Ladybug Birdfeeder, the head, eyes and spots are all made of plastic. This is ok, but for a company whose name refers to being plastic free, this feeder is not.The rest of the feeder is red powder coated wire mesh that seems durable and will hopefully last for quite a while. The “feet” of the ladybug are perches for birds to land on. I have to agree with another reviewer that the feet are not painted well. Underneath the black is red powder coating, which is visible in many spots on the feet (You can even see this in the product picture on this page with the sparrow). Perhaps another coat of the black paint might have been helpful.The company recommends Suet, Sunflower or Peanuts to fill the feeder with. The spacing in the mesh is pretty big, so any old Wild Bird seed would just fall through this feeder, leaving a mess on the ground.  With just a few options, I chose to fill the feeder with sunflower seed. That actually is too big for this mesh, unless the smaller Black Oil is used. The directions that came with the feeder did not specify that though, I bought the regular type. I would have thought the company would have given the buyer a heads up on that.The backside of the ladybug is flat so that it may be hung against a fence, which would stabilize the feeder when a bird lands on it. There is a chain with a loop to hang the feeder from. I have mine dangling on a hook in the garden. Unfortunately, I have yet to see a bird land on the feeder and try and feed from it, but it does get a visit from the neighborhood squirrel almost daily. The poor thing hangs upside down from the top of it and seems to struggle to get the sunflower seeds out through the mesh. Obviously smaller seeds are required if birds were to ever get their beaks in the holes.The No No Ladybug Birdfeeder is made in China (hopefully not with Lead powder coating) and should be hand washed with a mild soap. The FAQ’s on this page do not appear to apply to this feeder and need to be revised. For example they indicate that the product can be dish washed, when the included documentation does not recommend it. It also says you can put Nyger and Mixed Seed in this feed, but it would fall right through the holes.This time of year is not exactly bird feeding time, the colder winter months are much better, so it is not surprising to see a lack of birds flocking to this feeder, therefore I cannot take off any stars for that. I think if I put suet in it I will have much better luck and attract small birds to it. The cuteness factor of the Ladybug Bird Feeder is quite high and it seems pretty well built, even the squirrel thinks so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVSJ3WL8MPFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRJOV4I#wasThisHelpful","R3DVSJ3WL8MPFU","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Adonit Jot mini is good for artists and people who need to write on their touchscreen devices. One thing that comes to mind is a vendor using Square on their phone to make purchases can offer their customer a stylus instead of using their finger. For everyday use however I find isn’t always responsive as my finger is, it makes a tap, tap, tap noise when using it, and probably in time would scratch my screen protector (or screen) if used regularly. I would imagine people who love to draw on their iPads would like this device. It draws a nice precise fine line. The built in clip holds quite well, and the cap screws on to the other end when the stylus is in use. It’s small enough to fit in any pocket, but large enough to hold on to and not get lost. One thing that probably would get lost is the tiny clear plastic disc on the end of it. I have lost it twice now, and it is a real bugger to try and find because it is teeny and clear. Unfortunately, once this little disc is lost, the stylus is useless on touch screens (well at least the iPhone). Adonit should provide a few replacement discs in the package, but unfortunately they do not, which is a big problem. While the Jot Mini is a nice stylus, I think it is only necessary when a precise fine line is needed such as jotting notes, signing documents, drawing and graphics, or mapping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6J2UZX1UAT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","RN6J2UZX1UAT1","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many things to like about Lenmar’s Undead Power Maven case, and a few things not to like. The major dislike of this case is that it needs a dongle cable to use the headphones because the bottom of the case is too long for a regular plug to connect. Lose this cable or forget it on a long trip and you’re out of luck. It’s not like you can pop into Best Buy and pick one up. That’s definitely the biggest problem I have with this case.To install the Maven, the top of the case slides off and the phone slides into a groove that precisely fits the phone into an embedded lightning connector at the bottom. Once the phone is fully seated, just slide the top back on and it is ready to use. It fits the iPhone 6 snugly without adding too much bulk or weight and its hard plastic shell would probably protect the phone decently. I’m not sure what sort of damage would be done to the battery if the phone is dropped though. Hopefully the company protects the battery well, but I’m not going to be performing that test.At first I had trouble charging the phone in the case, but it turns out that I was not using a USB charger that had enough current. It charged the case by itself, but would not charge the iPhone in it. Plugging it into a different USB charger remedied this issue. When the iPhone is in the Lenmar Maven, the phone will charge first, and then after it is fully charged, the case will start charging, which takes about two hours to fully charge.While using the case I found that the sleep/wake and volume buttons were a little bit hard to use since they are the iPhone’s actual buttons and are inset around the plastic case. I’ve seen similar cases that had the buttons built into the case to resolve this issue. I probably would have preferred that, but it’s all in the angle and fingers that are being used. Once the iPhone’s charge is depleted pressing the button on the back of the case for three seconds will give the phone “Undead Power”, which will give the phone another full charge, plus a little bit more. This process takes about an hour and a half to get to 100%.While I may not use Lenmar’s Undead Power Maven as an every day case, I will certainly use it while travelling, camping, or in a place that I know I can’t readily plug in.Pros:LightweightEasily fits in jeans front pocketCase charges quicklyA great case when going on long flights without the ability to charge, or areas without power.Raised lip around screen provides protectionEasy to install and removeMicro USB cable can be used to sync iPhoneLED intuitively shows amount of charge left on case1Year WarrantyOne Free Replacement part (headphone cable, top piece or charging cable) if registered onlineCons:Needs a headphone dongle. If this is lost, headphones cannot be used.Case cannot get wet.

This may not work with some iPhone accessories or car audio that use a lightning connector for connectivity.“Amplified Sound” is nothing more than a hole for the sound of the speaker, leading to a chamber at the bottom of the case with smaller front facing holes, nothing electronic.A Little bit slippery, but curved back helps with grip.Cord contains leadCase slightly bulky","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQU86CU59WZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG8TIYA#wasThisHelpful","R3GQU86CU59WZF","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The weather has been so cold around here that no one has had the desire to drink icy cold frozen cocktails these days, but when I first got the Party Blast XL I made Piña Coladas that were as good as any that I have had in a bar or restaurant. Using Bacardi Piña Colada mix (the frozen kind in the can), 5 oz. Bacardi white rum and about 6 cups of ice the Party Blast XL just pulverized the ice to a delicious slush just like you’d get at a bar. There were no big chunks of ice that always seem to be there when making frozen drinks in a regular blender.I have also made some shakes and malts for dessert in the Black And Decker Party Blast XL and they come out great. There are four automatic cycles on the blender. Number three is for shakes and it is cool to watch it go. It starts out slow for quite awhile on number one, then goes to number two for just a bit, and whips up a finale with number three. The shakes and malts came out perfect every time. Not too thin, not too thick. They are really yummy. The other automatic settings are for margaritas, daiquiris, and smoothies. For Pina Coladas I used the daiquiri setting, which got the ice to the perfect consistency.  The blender also has four constant on speeds that can be run manually until you press the stop button. The pulse button allows fingertip operation for quick mix.The Black and Decker XL Blast Party Blender has a great looking red plastic base that has suction cups on all four of it’s legs insuring that it won’t go flying off the counter. It really needs that because you can feel the power of its 650-watt motor when it is engaged. The motor is loud, but doesn’t have to stay on long to get the job done. Once everything is mixed, the flip top spout makes pouring easy without having to lift the entire top off. The top fits snug, and as long as it is lined up with the spout properly and closed up, there is no way for it to spill while mixing. The top also has a handy shot glass built in for adding alcohol or other liquids. The mixing jar is plastic, but it is a heavy plastic that probably won’t crack if it is dropped (but I’m not going to test that). Cleanup is easy just remember this. The top goes in the top rack, the jar goes in the bottom rack of the dishwasher. That means no messy cleanup, and no removing the blades since they are built into the jar itself.Black and Decker has a great drink mixer here, and it will get a lot more use in the summer months.  Right now, hot chocolate sounds better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5HJI70DH22S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHBD10K#wasThisHelpful","RR5HJI70DH22S","A4U27URFECK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4U27URFECK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I made my favorite beef stew with dumplings.  Great comfort food.  It tasted better in this casserole than any pot I have ever used in the last 25 years.  The flavor of the meat and vegetables were enhanced and  locked in with the cover.  The dumplings are added at the end and they quickly were finished without absorbing too much of the stew juices.I know it's cast iron but this pot is sooo heavy, I was afraid I would drop it on the counter top and crack it.  II didn't but I would need some help carrying it to the table if I decide to serve directly from the casserole pot.  Instead, I transferred the stew to a serving piece.  I am looking forward to making soups and chili and more great dishes. This is a kitchen casserole to pass on to the family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XF677G234CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCOECRK#wasThisHelpful","R32XF677G234CE","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m not entirely sure of Kate Atkinson’s intentions but I applaud her as a fictional nonconformist.  This novel is so different than anything else I have read, including Life After Life, I’m in awe of her brilliance and credibility.The protagonist, Teddy (Edward) Todd, is a stoic bomber for the RAF. I learned more than I ever knew about the RAF, the mechanics of the bombers, especially the Halifax (Teddy’s plane), his different crews when he’s the Skipper, the strategy of the British and untold suffering.  The average age of an RAF was 22, and only half of them survived.  And shocking to me is that Churchill did not credit them after the war.  A different perspective, for sure, of what the British, at least Atkinson, may think of Churchill.  When Teddy is challenged about dropping bombs on innocents, Atkinson surely emphasizes her theme of savagery in the final analysis.This epic novel stretches on to a century of Teddy’s life as Atkinson circles back in time to grab different points of view. The suppressed inner-workings of this British family are exposed. His mother Sylvie is a passionate woman who favors Teddy of all her children, her “best boy.” I believe I could almost touch his family.  His wife, Nancy, is independent and enigmatic; her cordiality is a mystery at times.  They have one child, Viola, who is gifted with the best dialogue.  She wins the most selfish daughter and mother award, if there were such an award.  Her responses are demeaning and nasty to her father and children, particularly her son, Sunny.  Both of her children are born on a commune, sired by Viola’s husband, Dominic, possibly a bi-polar, child-like jerk. Viola’s daughter, Moon, serves as the philosopher symbolizing the inability of the family to communicate with each other.Teddy, despite his love for family, cannot express his thoughts.  He actually feels more comfortable as a bomber pilot than returning to the safety of family.  His childhood love of nature evolves into a small journalistic job after the War.  Atkinson emphasizes the goodness of Teddy and I wonder if he genetically passed on his inability to show emotion.  The British stiff upper-lip and all that may not be elusive.  Ursula emerges (sister to Teddy and star of Life After Life) when Atkinson wants to provide the reader with some humor and reality.This novel is incredible, and I have only presented a cursory sample of this sprawling work.  Reading Atkinson’s Afterword is somewhat illuminating but left me more in amazement of her intellect.  Every scene and piece of dialogue is preparing the reader for the end of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCU0UZ0LKKFUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316176532#wasThisHelpful","RCU0UZ0LKKFUY","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was more than pleasantly surprised when I unpacked these sheets.  They were ultra soft and after washing and putting them on a queen bed, they remained soft and smooth.  Microfibers are made from various materials but the packaging did not give any other content information except 100% microfiber. There were some wrinkles but they smoothed out on the mattress after a short time.  I did not iron them (nor would I ever iron sheets)!Since it is not fair to compare these sheets to a high thread-count cotton sheet, I can recommend these particular microfiber sheets for softness, lack of shrinkage and comfort.  The price posted was very reasonable for a complete set, which included one queen flat sheet, one queen fitted sheet (suitable for thicker mattresses) and two standard pillowcases.My only complaint is the color; it's grey and grey sheets are blah and these are no different.  I would never order that color but apparently they come in other colors and prints.  An excellent product with an outstanding price point.Amend: after another washing, the sheets are OK but too thin. 5/12","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R194ZG4H8QDI7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG90NGY#wasThisHelpful","R194ZG4H8QDI7C","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reminiscent of crime fiction without all the gimmicks, this solid translation is for those readers seeking authentic mysteries. Set in the Pont-Aven, a quaint village, it is a far cry from Paris; Commissaire Dupin polices this small community.  He captured my interest from the beginning; he is the typical irritable authority, but his caffeine addiction and method of solving crime is far from clichéd.The 91-year-old owner of a local hotel is found murdered on the restaurant floor. Dupin is called in and always seems exasperated as if disturbing his morning coffee and croissant is a nuisance.  However, his distinctive nature and temperament is at odds with the common techniques of his Breton colleagues.  It’s this sharp cynicism of Dupin that drives the plot. As a clever team, they produce multiple murder suspects.The contrast and suffocating sense of Pont-Aven and the sophistication of Paris play a solid role.  The French are know for their skillful ferreting out of the facts and meticulous approach to catastrophes.  And this story is no different.  I was fooled by the denouement as Bennalac inserted red herrings along the way.There is usually greed and secrecy involving murders and this theme does not deviate from that philosophy.  However, the difference is that this book is entertaining and does not insult an experienced crime/mystery reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKB7C5TD7WTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250061741#wasThisHelpful","R3TKB7C5TD7WTM","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Plunged into a setting of cooking and eating, I devoured this debut novel.  What a quirky, brilliant work of sorrow, humor, and foresight mixed with real recipes.The novel opens in the cold, stark areas of Minnesota with an incredible episode of stinky, Scandinavian lutefisk prepared by Lars Thorvald.  Lars, with an incredible palate and a purist, escapes this business and marries a tall, exciting sommelier with the name of Cynthia.  They have a baby, Eva, but Cynthia, is adverse to motherhood and leaves Lars with the infant to raise on his own.  Lars obsessively loves his daughter.  Cynthia does not physically re-appear until the end of the book.Enter feisty, quirky characters who are part of Eva’s life and Stradal manages to connect them in a sharp, introspective narrative.  The author’s use of imagery and imagination explodes on the pages.  Eva’s economically poor upbringing is almost palatable in the grubby apartments she lives.  The secondary characters provide the foundation for Eva’s adventures.  Their names are wonderful:  cousin Braque and her son, Hatch, Octavia Kincade, Celeste Mantilla, all serve a purpose defining the mixture of foods and international appeal.  Stradal’s characters take advantage of Eva’s talent but soon learn they cannot compete with her.  She is irrepressible.  This tall, interesting-looking woman is kind and sensitive.  Pat Prager, the most conventional of his characters, has more sides to her personality than the reader first imagines.Eva’s adventures and genius ability places her with a diverse group of chefs and men who are besotted with her.  Her originality and super palate leads her to stardom among those who love and can afford the best food.  She developed a pop-up supper club where an invitation is costly and coveted.Stradal’s writing frequently reminded me of John Irving, brilliant, quirky characters with immense talent who experience heartache and some joy.  The symbolism of food in this novel mirrors Eva’s robust spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RICHRBMJ3YF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052542914X#wasThisHelpful","R1RICHRBMJ3YF7","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are interested in reading an introspective memoir that makes you as uneasy as the writer, this could be a unique exercise. Alexandra Fuller, growing up in Rhodesia to exotic, unconventional parents, leaves Africa and marries an American, Charlie Ross, and later moves to Wyoming.Her wedding is miraculous as she provides us with snippets of events.  Despite the fact that she develops malaria, her parents alleviate some of the symptoms and she is now a bride with a high fever.  One of the most poignant interchanges takes places at the wedding when a Polish father from the Catholic mission advises her that the first year of marriage is hard and then it gets worse.  She is astounded by his remark and laughs at him since he is a celibate man who probably has lived in the bush too long.  And then his response, “I should know. I've been married to God for fifty years.”We never really know Charlie, he is the father of her three children and I can never really determine the divide between the two of them.  There are some complaints and narratives but maybe he is a symbol of her double allegiances.  She is from Africa but she is not really African, and maybe not an American, either.  The book becomes centered on her divorce; there are immoderations in Wyoming and extreme tragedies in Africa.  Alexandra’s mother loses three children, one of which, Alexandra may be partly responsible for her death.  She looks up to her father; she seems to live on every word and can regurgitate his homilies often.I was caught up in the chaos and beauty of Africa.  Living in this environment is living with extremes.  America does not deliver the peace she believes she is promised.  She tries to make sense of all that has happened to her. It is difficult for all of us, who suffer from overpowering emotions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I80TW3ARQ5U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205868#wasThisHelpful","R3I80TW3ARQ5U5","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, Anna Benz, your creator, Ms. Essbaum shaped you into a modern narcissistic, sexual addict fashioned after Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary.  Although you are an American, she cajoled you into marrying a Swiss banker, Bruno, nine years ago and dropping you in Zurich. In those nine years, you had three children, Victor, Charles (your favorite) and Polly Jean.  You never really made any friends, not that you wanted them, and instead became an aimless, manic woman who suffered for all your sins.And Anna’s suffering is profound.  The author initially made me hopeful when she teamed her up with Doktor Messerli, a psychoanalyst, who interprets her dreams and coaxes her to write a journal.  Their sessions are monumental,  as we can observe the escalation of Anna’s problems and her reticence to consider her maladies.  But Anna, posing as a housefrau, is too busy with her sexual relationships, which are presented in ultra graphic scenes bordering on extremes.  Overindulgences are Anna’s way of coping, like an alcoholic that cannot stop drinking.  She knows she should stop but takes many chances.  Even though she may envision the consequences of her actions, she inflicts more damage despite the grave reprisals.In this particular part of her life, Anna is attending a German class and she apparently sends signals to men who want to have tryst (I’m being kind with that word).  Archie is the chosen one and their meetings are frequent and rather surreal.  Violence is not excluded from this novel and her sexual encounters, often ferocious.  leave Anna nonplused.  She seems a like a dead woman walking and as promised, the consequences befall her.  Every mother’s nightmare becomes her own.  Castigation and acts of horrific abuse are also in the cards.The novel is well written but I became somewhat exasperated without a strong plot and wanted less despair for this complicated housefrau. Anna’s freedom to “wile”“away her day while her mother-in-law cared for her children seemed incongruous.  Ms. Essbaum’s literary allusions were first-rate but the scenes seemed to click-clack like the Zurich trains.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW04XV3687MWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997530#wasThisHelpful","RW04XV3687MWC","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The dynamics and tentative balance of the Lee family is a study in racism and the fierce battles to belong.  The technical talent of Ms. Ng is remarkable.  She is able to move the reader from the climax of the plot and invade our senses with flashbacks of this family in crisis.A terrible tragedy occurs to Lydia, the teenage daughter of Marilyn and James Lee, an “American” mother and Chinese father.  No one knows the feeling of exclusion from society better than James, who apparently feels ostracized even as an adult.  He is a college professor, teaching the history of the cowboy, of all things.  He is accustomed to ridicule and wants his children, particularly Lydia, to have many friends, popularity and feel a part of a social crowd.Marilyn, on the other hand, is angry because she did not become the doctor or scientist and decides Lydia will be the one to attain those goals.  Living vicariously through Lydia is a main thrust of the story.  It is a sad commentary on our society and the mistakes too many parents make when believing their children want what they want.The family is dysfunctional, the oldest child, Nathan, is overly anxious to leave the nest and poor Hannah, the youngest, is almost totally ignored and starving for affection.  Ng’s most credible perception of the family’s catastrophe is seen and through her eyes and heart.  She is the omniscient one without knowing it.Marilyn’s presence as a mother comes at a great cost to the family.  Her expectations preclude her from delving into her children’s hearts and knowing who they are.  For an intelligent woman, she really believes her children have the same aspirations as she does.  James is floundering and because he does not have a sense of belonging, it becomes a tragic tale.The plot is precise and the author’s prose enriches the story as the fabric of this family is shoved aside.  It is heartbreaking but there are responsibilities that Marilyn has abandoned.  At one point in their lives, Marilyn leaves and returns to school, abandoning her family.  James is not equipped to help his children get through this upheaval.  When Marilyn returns, she asks the children if they behaved while she was gone.  She did not apologize or offer any explanation.  Tragic consequences are now entering their lives. This is an outstanding first novel; I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6O1VKKCFC0PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420571X#wasThisHelpful","R6O1VKKCFC0PX","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I inherited my family’s Regina Electrik Broom.  I think it was first made in the 1960’s and it’s still working!  I never gave it away because it does the job on a wood floor by picking up the crumbs, glass particles and some dust.  The cup needs to be emptied and it’s quite loud and, of course, it must be plugged into an outlet that will accommodate the length of the cord.So here is this fabulous Black and Decker Lithium Stick Vacuum and after working with this new efficient technology, I may finally donate my Regina Broom.  We assembled this easily and put it to its test on the floors and carpets. Only one screw was needed to assemble, really one screw.  Needless to say, I am totally impressed.  Not only does it have enormous suction capability, it is quiet, lightweight, bagless, and good-looking. We tried it on the sofa and it suctioned the invisible crumbs with no effort.I particularly appreciate the design except I cannot find a place to store the rotary brush; it’s the only design flaw that I can find.  The vacuum held its charge for about 20 minutes at least and charging is easy.  The lithium battery is not replaceable, however. The product “feels” expensive, it is not junkie, it all fits together.I liked the balance of the product probably because the head of the vacuum rotates from side to side with me.  It doesn’t work against me.  This is a vacuum that has definitive changes to meet my needs.  I am not an obsessed housecleaner by any means, but if I’m doing it, I want it to be easier.

"I am somewhat tech savvy, working in offices for years and learning to adjust to new hardware and software.  This printer should have been an easy installation.  I have a Mac, which required the removal of a hard orange-colored package.  I did not really have the strength but after working with it for about 10 minutes, I disengaged it.  I could not have accomplished any of this without accessing a Canon video on their website.  It was complicated for me and not intuitive and it would have been simpler if I had a PC.This is a humongous personal printer.  It is almost the size of an office desk printer.  I worked with Canon Office products for years and they surpass their Home products in every area.  If I recall, they are separate companies and the Canon office products were sold to businesses only.  They are expensive but they are state-of-the-art and even though, we were trained to use their equipment, the manuals were easy to understand.I have a small home office Canon color printer now.  It is much lesser in size and it eats up the ink.  The printed product is mediocre.

"I’m not usually excited about novels that include recipes, but this narrative had a clever hook using recipes written in the 1700’s.  The instructions for the recipes are straightforward, as is the originator of most of the recipes.  Biddy “Obedience” Leigh is the under-cook at Mawton Hall.  She is a zealous cook who is planning to leave her post for married life.  Of course, there would be no story if this plot were played out; instead, the master, an old, ugly man surprises everyone and marries the young Lady Carinna.Lady Carinna recognizes that Biddy is a quick study and requests her help on a long journey.  The journey is not, of course, what Biddy expected, and many odd demands and resourceful ideas are expected of this young cook.The format of the book is set up in a flashback of eighteen months.  The story opens with a ghastly discovery by Lady Carinna’s opportunistic brother.  The novel centers around Biddy who becomes a woman of courage and wit against the backdrop of the late 1770’s.  Her passion for cooking is mixed well with the author’s clever ability to move from cooking to murder, slavery, romance, loss and ultimately, friendship.  The author uses a complicated technique to move the mystery along.  It is a fun book; at times, I thought the plot became a bit cumbersome and the dialogue could be confusing.  However, the author’s efforts in writing an innovative story should appeal to many readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8B2CLJ3ESJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250056918#wasThisHelpful","R1B8B2CLJ3ESJY","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Max Lerner was always star-struck.  He was mildly obsessed with celebrities and when he lands a writing job for KNOW, a sorta-like People or Entertainment Weekly, he is in the right place to live out the dream.  He has a beautiful live-in girl friend, Samantha, the love of his life since childhood.  She is a wanna be actress and she encourages him to write; she is a big influence in everything he does.  He adores her.  Well, when she finally is cast in a respectable part, she falls in love with the leading man, who happens to be a childhood idol of Max, Johnny Mars.  How inconvenient.The book provides us with Max's acuity as an interviewer, he has the ability to ask the right questions and move in and out of the movie star circles.  When Samantha cuckolds him, he is devastated for years and years.  He only wants her and apparently feels he is incapable of loving another woman.  This situation drags on for too long despite the fact that Samantha is married and is fawning and servile to her famous husband.  She maintains a connection with Max as she jet sets around the world and trusts him with her secrets and feelings.  He has never betrayed her.  Max continues to meet women but no one can open his heart, except maybe one woman he meets on a movie set.  This meeting is weak, makes little sense and her characterization is vague from beginning to end.A tragedy occurs and then a final tragedy, which was a not surprising twist to the novel.  The author writes well; his prose is smooth and he leads the reader from paragraph to paragraph with ease.  The book was better than I thought, and I'm giving it four stars for some of his insights and raw knowledge of the movie industry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TOHJYKK0VX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307949613#wasThisHelpful","R12TOHJYKK0VX3","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These special wax candles provide scents that are not overpowering yet permeate the room with a pleasing odor.  I chose the FALL HARVEST for a mixture of fall scents.  Pumpkin Spice is my favorite followed by Autumn Leaves and Cranberry.  The trio is a sensible mix and evokes memories for me of a lodge in the winter and a warm living room with a fireplace.The size of the candles are convenient and take little space.  Snuffing out the lighted candle is quite simple by screwing the cap on and then I can re-use it.  No mess.

"Once again, Alyson Richman demonstrates her talent and meticulous knowledge in a fervent novel.  As I wrote in my previous review of THE LOST WIFE, she enhances the customary (if there is a typical) novel of the Holocaust from a different angle.  In that wonderful book, she grabbed the reader's attention with painting and art as a sharp contrast to the horrors of the Nazis.In this treasure, the author finds music as the powerhouse to transport the reader to the agonies, bravery and love of the German's victims.  She brings beauty to a vicious story; this novel takes places in Italy.  I learned about the Italian Resistance, who seemed to single-handedly try and push back the Germans.  Not much was mentioned of the Italian army except for Mussolini's efforts to be on the ""right"" side for his own victory.Highlighting the Bertolli family, from Verona, whose only child, Elodie is a remarkable cello musician with a photographic memory. Elodie joins the Resistance after the Fascists beat her father for playing music.  Once again, the cruelty is almost impossible to comprehend.  This small group of Italians, trying to avoid annihilation of their families and homeland, are boundless in their courage and intellect.Elodie has special jobs to pass messages and they require her musical talent and perfect memory.  Not all goes well, of course, and the fate of her mentor and lover robs her of all that is good.  She is a strong character, however, and continues to fight for her country, her mother and her own survival.Richman brings in another intelligent character, a medical doctor who also suffered an imaginable loss.  She is able to intertwine their lives, without too much coincidence but some scenes are a bit sappy.  This slight weakness did not trump her elegant writing and providing a musical point of view with passion and clarity against the ruthlessness of the Nazis.  This book emphasized the Nazi's equal opportunity liquidation of Jews and non-Jews.  There is beauty in the story written with love of a classical music for the cello and the surreal beauty of Italy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MM0OESC8KL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOE4LJA#wasThisHelpful","R8MM0OESC8KL2","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicole Helget’s tactile images of Minnesota from 1830 to 1870 connect the metaphors and the plot.  From the very first chapter, the author paints a vivid picture when a logjam paralyzes the town on the St. Croix River.The story is based on twins, Clement and Angel, the latter growing up in a rich but chaotic, and often insane environment.  Clement, separated from his sister grew up in an orphanage, under the care of Big Waters, who was also shunned by her tribe and relatives.  The mother of the twins is Lydian, who after running away from Beaver Jean, a trapper, leaves her twins in the nunnery.  Sentimentality is a void for this young mother and this lack of mawkishness is also present in Angel.Most of the story is presented in flashback giving in to a random plot.  The motivation of the characters was often without credibility and justification of their actions elicited more questions about character development.The strength of the novel is Helget’s superb prose and the juxtaposition of the pioneering Minnesota spirit with the harsh weather and surrounding.  I could almost feel the overpowering weight of the weather and the starkness of the historical time and terrain.  However, the plot lacked strength with characters whose motives and actions left me indifferent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129KNOIHIUCW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547898207#wasThisHelpful","R129KNOIHIUCW3","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have had the cosmetic on for over 12 hours, and my face remains fresh looking, I do not have to touch it up or apply an extra coat or a separate powder product.

"It's fall 2008 and the economy is tanking, the recession is rearing its ugly head.  Hard working Americans are losing their jobs because of the toxic wickedness of the bankers and mortgage brokers, who never really were punished.  Instead, many honest employees lost their jobs and their homes.Grisham paints a quick picture of this horrific time and links it to a large New York law firm who panics and initiates a steady firing of the many associates.  One of these associates is our heroine, Samantha Kofer, an Ivy League graduate of Georgetown and Columbia Law and a third year associates.  She is among a tier of associates who are ""furloughed.""  Not fired outright, but on leave and the law firm shows its largesse by offering one year paid healthcare insurance if these employees work for a non-profit group for that duration.  Such irony, isn't it?  These cold-hearted, covering their assets, are willing to pay twelve months of coverage if they work, without pay, for some organization that is the antithesis of their philosophy.  Actually, the firm is paying for their COBRA, which they are most likely entitled to under law.So Samantha mulls over the proposition.  She talks to her divorced parents who are attorneys, the father disbarred and the mother working for the government.  They both recommend other avenues rather than working for free.  However, to move the plot along, Grisham entertains us with all the non-profits being deluged with prospective lawyers and they have no room for any more volunteers.  One would think they would accept as much free, licensed lawyers as possible. After much soul-searching, Samantha finds an internship in Appalachia at the Mountain Legal Aid Clinic.She steps out of her world of privilege and into one of inequality and poverty.  She enters the beauty of Appalachia and the stark contrast to the suffering of coal miners.  Their pain and complicated black lung disease has been inflicted by the politicians and the owners of the mining companies.  They are ruthless and have devised plans to refuse benefits to sick miners and they need to continue to work to save their families from starvation.Samantha is relegated to living in a garage apartment of one of the paid lawyers and she learns quickly the methodical rape of the mountains by the mining companies via strip mining.  Those that sold their land to the companies were cheated. Samantha meets the Gray brothers; Donovan is a brilliant attorney who knows how to fight the bad guys.  His brother is Jeff, who is loyal to his brother and the land.  Grisham brings us two detailed cases, both of which are heartbreaking and instruct the reader on meticulous legal machinations.These cases are fascinating and specific and bring the aching suffering of the miners and the pillage of the land into reality.  Samantha's character is a dichotomy.  She is often sympathetic, sarcastic, flippant and conventional.  I had difficulty buying into her transformation and ability to have superficial relationships with men. Grisham has more success with male protagonists.  However, Grisham's talent to disgrace the coal industry for its prejudice and disrespect is haunting.  He is a major novelist and hopefully, he will bring some shame to the coal business, and maybe justice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGB9I3R40LQW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYWUHO4#wasThisHelpful","RGB9I3R40LQW5","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The towels are well designed in terms of the pattern coordination and the different sizes.  I particularly like the wash cloth, it's a good item to keep by the sink and since all of these items can be washed, it serves a good purpose for wiping the sink and counters.However, I compared these towels to super-absorbent towels I was given as a gift about a year ago.  These towels do not hold a candle to my other ones.  They are not absorbent, the moisture seems to bead off and I needed to pick up another towel to really dry an item.They may be OK if I run out of other towels, but I would not buy them as they are flimsy for their purpose. I also would not buy brown, it's not bright enough.AMENDED: I thought I would give these towels another try during our Thansgiving dinner post washing dishes marathon. They were worthless.

"The title and the photograph were so compelling, I was almost sure I was going to read an upscale mystery with some great twists.  Having read many of Margolin's previous books, I thought he might have finally hit a homerun.The photograph, Woman With A Gun, suggests a period piece with the antique firearm.  Instead, we have a cluttered murder story with the typical young writer, Stacy Kim, smart and creative who chucked a Harvard education to get an MFA and write a best seller.  She has little writing background; in fact, she apparently received her only kudos from one short story.  Not able to get her creative juices flowing, she takes a dull job as law firm receptionist in New York and one day visits the Museum of Modern Art during her lunch hour.  She sees the work of photographer, Kathy Moran, and knows the Woman With A Gun could become her blockbuster novel.She leaves New York, quits her tedious job, and moves to Oregon to learn the origins of this photo.  She discovers an unsolved murder, involving the dead husband, Raymond Cahill and beautiful (very recent) wife, Megan Cahill, the bride holding the six-shooter.  Margolin presents some of the plot in flashback spanning 2000 to 2015.The most interesting character is Jack Booth, who was a special prosecutor with the Oregon Department of Justice, assigned to assist in the Cahill murder.  He is portrayed as a crackerjack attorney, but Margolin depicts him as a nave man whose attraction to Kathy Moran never wanes. Kathy, former attorney, famous photographer, and intermittent drug user and rehab resident, uses and abuses Jack and Jack doesn't get it. Hard to believe.The other male characters are attorneys, a cold-blooded killer, a bartender and the primary murder victim.  Kathy Moran was the most interesting female, but her characterization was flimsy and repetitive.The mystery is easy to solve and I was hoping for more depth to the plot and the characters.  It was predictable and cursory.  He did not connect some of the characters to the plot and the women were sure smarter than the men.  There were a few good scenes, mostly involving Kathy Moran, but the others were clichéd.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OH5ICLOWA2I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062266527#wasThisHelpful","R1OH5ICLOWA2I2","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This layout makes sense and within each section, the recipes are original with a twist to some classics.  For instance,, the grilled cheese is french onion soup in a sandwich, ordinary french toast becomes peaches and cream french toast.She has an explanation prior to giving the reader the Ingredients and Method (how you put it all together). The short intros enhance the recipe with a personal history and some tips, giving the reader/cook more explanation and confidence.There are two small criticisms: many of the ingredients are not those one would have in your conventional cooking kitchens and the type is very light and small.

"Mike Greenberg created a semi-plausible character, Jonathan Sweetwater, who is the only child of the deceased liberal senator, Percival Sweetwater III. The last time he has seen his father he was nine years old and this loss of father/son relationship remains a mystery to him.  However, now  Jon has an ideal life, with his wife, Claire, the love of his life and his two happy, healthy children, Phoebe and Drew.Despite refusing his father's inheritance, Jonathan makes it on his own and moves near the pinnacle of the corporate ladder of a Wall Street firm at 40 years old.  His boss, Bruce, is also a friend and they play basketball almost every morning where ""Johnny"" wipes him off the floor, so to speak.Jon's life is shattered when, upon arriving home early, he thinks he discovers conjugal infidelity.  He is almost paralyzed with angst and cannot breathe.  Rather than confronting the possible situation head-on, he believes if he could learn about this father, it might help him handle these dire circumstances.  After speaking to his own mother, who is the first wife, he decides to track down and meet the other five wives.  He travels far and wide, from cities to mountaintops, and meets each woman; they all ""happen"" to be home or available on these surprise visits.  They are glib women who loved Percy dearly.  He left them heartbroken but they managed to survive with large bank accounts.  They each tell him something about his father, but none of it is really earth shattering. There is no epiphany.The book is a page-turner despite the predictability of the plot. There are a few secondary characters that trump the boring wives.  One is the private investigator who seems to be out of a Damon Runyon story and the other is Ken Siegel, the head of corporate security, who is more realistic.Our Jon is a sentimental guy who finds great joy in his family and his children's school.  Despite the fact that Jon seems to drink his way through every meal, he finds comfort as his journeys come to an end.  There is a twist at the end of the book and there is a rather weird, tawdry scene in the children's school, which surprised me. Claire remained somewhat of a mystery, but Jonathan is an open book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBLZ3J42EYI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325868#wasThisHelpful","RVBLZ3J42EYI9","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liane Moriarty's talent provides us with narration from her superb, multi-faceted characters.  She introduces us to abuse and bullies through Madeline, Celeste and Jane.  These may seem like ordinary women but their differences draw them together and they are intelligent analysts of motivation.  Under the setting of a school in Australia (it could have been in the U.S.), we learn of the wretched pain of Jane and her son, Ziggy.  Beautiful Celeste is more than a victim of a rich husband with twin boys.  Madeline, twice married, may seem superficial but she is anything but shallow.I could not put the book down.  The author cleverly used a literary technique of a police ""interrogation"" warning the reader something bad happened on the annual Trivia Night.

"I thought somewhere during the first third of the book, this wasn’t real.  The characters are standing and moving around studying the works of art of the missing husband, Peter Morrow.  They are all attempting to delve into the meaning of this absurd art and are struggling with an answer. It resembled a circular dance.Clara, wife of Peter Morrow, is a famous artist, who has gone beyond technical drawing.  Her art has life and meaning.  She and her husband Peter separated a year prior with the promise they would reunite one year later and discover if their marriage could be filled with love and respect for each other.  Clara is much more successful professionally than Peter.  Is he jealous?  Does he not love Clara anymore?  Peter does not show up on the scheduled day of return, so dreadful.  And Clara was going to put steaks on the grill and buy croissants, too. Oh dear.She enlists Armand Gamache, a retired Inspector, who has his own problems as he attempts to block out his past travails and enjoy retirement with his lovely wife, Reine-Marie.  This story takes place in Three Pines, a picturesque village in Canada.  The characters are philosophical; Myrna, who is a therapist and bookstore owner, is a close friend of Clara’s and travels with her to find the long lost Peter. There is Armand’s son-in-law, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, who seems deliberate, but Myrna feels that Armand is too critical of him. Annie, daughter of Gamache and wife of Jean-Guy, is given short shrift.  The emphasis is on the Morrows’ art professors, who are elusive at best.The plot is so thin, it is almost transparent.  From the very melodramatic scene when Clara is observing Armand reading a book on a bench, the genre is way overplayed. The ending was contrived; I did not discover a genuine theme to the book except that we all have a different way of “finding” ourselves and becoming useful.  There is also an allusion to Somerset Maugham’s “Appointment in Samarra,” which could have emerged as a more poignant theme and plot, but the author did not carry this through.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VKLC2BQANLEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HY09X5W#wasThisHelpful","R1VKLC2BQANLEJ","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charlotte Baird was small; her hands were small, her face was small, she was tiny in structure and yet she had big ideas.  She was a young girl ahead of her time.  As an heiress to the Lennox fortune, she was sought after by both sexes.  She was astute and not naïve about the ploys of her half-brother, his wife and her aunt.  Goodwin emphasized her love of photography (which was most likely fictional) and would identify her human subjects with animals.  Her betrothed is Bay Middleton (apparently some distant relative of the Katherine, the Duchess of Cambridge).  And here we were led to believe that the Middletons were out of their league when Kate became engaged to William!  Bay Middleton was no slouch. He had the typical wit of a ladies' man and he was a very talented rider and superb fox hunter.The passion for fox hunting brings The Empress of Austria to England.  She is a beautiful woman who captures the attention of  the European upper class and ""Sisi,"""" as she is called by her family, is determined to get what she wants.  She is a bit eccentric, traveling with a pet monkey and surrounds herself with people who will amuse and excite her. The description of her hair is fascinating which validates her reputation of narcissism. She meets Bay Middleton and they become the center of gossiping royalty since she is married to the Emperor of Austria.  But does he really love Charlotte? Or does not like being told what to do by the Empress?  What?  This is pedestrian.As the story unravels, there are some good scenes that define the characters of the main players but the history was inaccurate, sometimes by a decades.  The scene with Queen Victoria was amusing but quite predictable. The juiciest bit of fact is that Bay Middleton had an out-of-wedlock child with another woman, which was alluded to in the opening of the novel.  This child was Clementine, who became the loving wife of Winston Churchill, whose own mother was American.In addition to the accuracies, the dialogue had this consistent cadence of condescending conversations, (excuse the alliteration) filled with half-truths and sarcasm.  This became annoying.  I expected so much more from the book; it was disappointing.Historical novels can be difficult because many authors fuse fact with fiction.  Daisy Goodwin apparently went overboard with ""poetic license,"" so much so that the lack of historical accuracy confounded me.  The imprecise chronology overshadowed the plot and certainly the characterization.  Not until the Author's Note at the end did she redeem herself explaining some of  the obvious mixture of history and fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MS63XPOV0QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043891#wasThisHelpful","R15MS63XPOV0QX","A17TASZJT6Y39D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17TASZJT6Y39D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used these bleach crystals in place of liquid bleach for laundry.  I washed white towels, bed spreads, and a comforter.  All came out clean and white.  I like that there is less chlorine smell than with the liquid bleach.  It is also more convenient to dispense, since you do not have to handle a large bottle trying to pour and not to spill liquid bleach.  Each container has a measuring cup at the top, and the amount of crystals suggested for use is a lot smller than the amount of liquid bleach I measure out arbitrarily.  Speaking of spills, cleaning up crystals would be easier than cleaning up liquid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y7HNVN6QWI22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EVP2UG#wasThisHelpful","R2Y7HNVN6QWI22","A3G5MOHY1U635N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G5MOHY1U635N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Bristles are tough and clean GRill GRates GReat, it reaches between the bars, it is sturdy, the handle is angled so that it is comfortable to use and keeps your hand away from the heat.  I already own one brush and I bought this second one as a present, and it was a hit.I've been using the brush for a few months, and, at this point, I cannot think of any negatives.  There are several branded and unbranded versions of this brush on the interwebs.  Some cost more than others.  I purchased from two different sellers (including this one), one had a brand name printed on the handle and this one didn't, but the brushes are identical.

"Tonight's Made From Scratch Taste (R) Yummers awards go to: High Fructose Corn Syrup,  Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Malic Acid, Caramel Color, Natural Flavors  Dextrose, and Xantan Gum.Traditional Bloody Mary recipes do not ask for anything sweet.  This mix lists high fructose corn syrup and sugar among ingredients, and the sweetness comes through in the finished product.  I think it is absolutely unnecessary.  Although I think the flavor of the mix is OK with strong tomato taste, and well-balanced acidity and spiciness, and the texture feels like tomato juice should, I think the mix would be better without sweeteners.  Additionally, there are preservatives, colors, flavors, and xantan gum in the product, which you would not have in a made-from-scratch cocktail.  I am surprised by the amount of extra ingredients in this new product considering that consumers now are seeking more natural products.I am also confused by sea salt and salt listed separately.  First, I do not understand the need for two salts.  Second, I thought all salt was sea salt even if it is now mined from an area where there is no longer a sea.Bloody Mary is not a difficult cocktail to make, and it doesn't require any exotic ingredients.  If you make it often, it would make sense to prepare it as recipe calls for it from individual ingredients.

"761 has replaced 551, which died from water damage.  This vacuum runs on the daily schedule at 9 AM and does a not-too-bad of a job of keeping the living room, dining room, and the kitchen floor clean.I thought higher and newer model would be better, but it is pretty much the same, maybe a tad quieter.  The robot occasionally gets stuck on power cords, occasionally gets hung off a step (nose falls off the step, and the vacuum just hangs there until I get home), occasionally misses areas (I think random pattern is not the best choice for a robot vacuum, it would be better if it mapped the room first).  It is also quite dumb.  A few days ago I watched it bump into a console table leg, back up a bit, turn 360 degrees, and bump into the same leg again.  It did this for 5 minutes until it finally turned 90 degrees and scooted away.I had 551 for a couple of years and I was surprised to see no noticeable improvement in logic and performance.

"I purchased white AlpineSwiss Stefan shoes on a different website, which doesn't allow leaving detailed feedback, but I felt like expressing my opinion about these shoes, so I am posting here.Shoes look good with my Levi's 501s in Burrough.  That 's about all for positives.I wear 8.5 size shoes, so I ordered these in 9 (rounded up as directed by the seller).  I think size 8 would be a better fit for my foot.  The insole is completely flat, practically without cushioning, and zero arch support.  I used Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Extra Support Insoles to make these shoes more comfortable.I do not like extra thick padding around ankle, I think thick collars make these otherwise streamlined shoes look heavier than they are.  However, jeans cover that area, so it is somewhat OK, but I wouldn't wear these shoes with shorts.  I found that these shoes get pretty hot, with all the padding there is little air flow.Also, the included shoelaces are ridiculously long.  I couldn't adjust the standard shoelace bow knot so that neither loops nor ends dragged on the ground.  I pulled white shoelaces from my white Cole Haan Air Ryders which these AlpineSwiss Stefan shoes were intended to replace.With new insoles and shoelaces I made these shoes wearable, so i rate them OK.  However, that's an additional spending of ~$20 ($15 insoles + $5 shoelaces) on top of $25 I already spent on these shoes.  They are still not very comfortable, and I will not buy these shoes again nor will I recommend these to anyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2QU1RLRHT99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FIOAK4#wasThisHelpful","RU2QU1RLRHT99","A3G5MOHY1U635N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G5MOHY1U635N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The bulb works well.  I have other 40W equivalent LED lamps and this bulb is similar to those in brightness.  The light distribution is slightly less than 360 degrees but only because LED bulbs have bigger bases than non-LED ones.

The bulb looks very clean with the white base, and there are no markings (brand name, warnings, etc) not even a sticker on the base, which makes the bulb well positioned for applications where the light bulb is exposed.

There are cheaper options, which should be considered, especially if replacing multiple light bulbs as it gets pretty expensive.

"I used this drain with a Dreamline Slimline DLT-1130602 acrylic shower base.  The drain looks very good and was easy to install.  It is all metal parts with the exception of the rubber seal and the internal bushing.  It uses Fernco bushing to seal against the drain pipe rather than a compression bushing like Oatey 140 NC drain.  I was concerned about potential leaks, but so far it seems fine.  It is pricey however, I got a good deal on a Like New but I wouldn't pay full price.  In that case I would go with Oatey.

"This is one of those ubiquitous film screen protectors like the cheapest ones for phones and other portable screens.  It consists of the screen protection film sandwiched between two layers.  You peel layer one and apply the protector to the screen, squeeze bubbles out, and then peel off layer 2.This type of film works well enough for me, and I use it on every screen device in the family.  The film might get scratched, but the screen under remains like new.  If you are careful enough to not have any dust on the screen before applying the screen protector, you will be able to remove all bubbles, but even the tiniest speck of dust will result in a bubble.  Aligning the protector requires patience because due to its size even the slightest deviation from the bezel line at the beginning of the application will result in the screen protector being noticeably off by the end of the install.The problem I have with this protector is that after carefully cleaning the screen, aligning and applying the protector, and squeezing out all bubbles, I cannot get the upper right corner to stick - about 1/16"" is stubbornly lifting.  It does not seem like it is sitting on the bezel, but it just won't stay down.  It is not a big deal, because the rest of the screen is completely bubble free, but it is annoying.  In the past I had a similar problem with this type of film, so it was not completely unexpected.However, there are other types of film e.g. self-healing ZAGG InvisibleShield and Skinomi which I never had a problem with those not fully sticking to the surface.  When I purchased SUPERSHIELDZ screen protector, I thought I was getting that type of film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDMKPE5BMYWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XK61CEO#wasThisHelpful","R3NDMKPE5BMYWC","A3G5MOHY1U635N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G5MOHY1U635N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you do not read cooking directions every time before cooking and have both Pronto and regular pasta in your kitchen, you might confuse cooking methods because Pronto and non-Pronto boxes look identical.

"UPDATE Nov-2015:  I use this tablet every day and still like it. If speakers were front facing and it had an auto-dim feature, I'd consider it a perfect tablet.  I use it with Qy8 BT earphones and it is great for Netflix.ORIG REVIEW Jul-2015: I have been using Lenovo Tab2 A10-70 for a few weeks.  So far, I am happy with it.  The setup was easy.  It performs well.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of bloatware. Netflix, YouTube, Gmail, and Chrome all work well.  The screen image is good, and 10"" screen is my preference for tablets.  Overall, I like this tablet.Lollipop update for this tablet has been released. Please note that UPDATE TAKES A LONG TIME for the tablet to restart after an update.  Mine showed Lenovo splash screen and then the screen stayed black for 10 minutes.  Since my tablet was only a week old and I had everything backed up/synced, I did a full factory reset after update to Lollipop.  Not sure if this was necessary, but I had bad experience installing just updates on my other devices - they slowed down and misbehaved.  After update to Lollipop, the factory reset will not take you back to Kit Kat, but it will erase all data and settings and remain at Lollipop.  The tablet works fine with Lollipop.The following items I see as negatives.  First, the center of the tablet's back panel is flexing, which gives it a cheap feeling.  I addressed it by installing a Fintie cover.  Second, there does not seem to be a screen brightness auto-adjustment feature.  My four year old Toshiba Thrive, which this tablet has replaced, had that feature.  I wish speakers were front facing.  Other than these, I have not found any problems with the tablet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJLREIBCVP6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR05L9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2PJLREIBCVP6L","A3G5MOHY1U635N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G5MOHY1U635N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used the Oreck Revitalize to clean a very light cream wool carpet that had lots of stains and dirt on it. The result was nice, but not perfect. The stains still require spotting, which does not surprise me. The remainder of the carpet looked immensely improved; however, not as good as the results of professionals with a truck-mounted cleaner.Cleaning the carpet was significant work. You do have to vacuum carefully, first, including the edges where dirt is trapped. As other reviewers noted, the soap and water dispenser is rather small and requires several refills to finish a small room. You have to push the soap and water release button while you cover a path, then go over the same path without releasing the soap and water in order to suck up the soap and dirty water. Going over the path several times results in better cleaning. Following this, you have to refill the container with clean water (no soap) and repeat the process in order to rinse the carpet and remove more dirt.Although the lower container did have some muddy water in it, there wasn't nearly the amount of water that I had released onto the rug. When I opened the collection container, I realized that there is a filter in it that might have been clogged with carpet fibers.Also, the cord had accidentally looped around the front of the cleaner and opened the covering of the hole used to insert the attachment hose. I'm thinking that this might have reduced the suction of the cleaner while I used it.The cleaner does collect a lot of carpet fiber, even from a high quality carpet. I had to clean the carpet fibers from the brushes several times while using the machine.I found it difficult to clean the Oreck. The machine is clear plastic so you can see accumulated dirty carpet fibers inside. The two front brushed detach easily so you can pick out the gunk. The remove the other brushes, you need to unscrew them from the machine.  The worst was the interior of the front section where you attach the hose for cleaning upholstery. It was filled with dirty carpet fibers and had no easy access. I used a Q-Tip to push the fibers towards the opening where I could remove them.In the end, the Oreck cleans the carpet well enough; it's just a lot of work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNVFFN4OFRQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWN6#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNVFFN4OFRQL","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The large number of positive reviews influenced me to read this memoir of the tragic death of the author’s first husband, Boone, at the age of fifty-one from brain cancer.  It details the ordeal suffered by the wife, Prissy Elrod, during the approximate year from diagnosis to death.There are several things that I didn’t realize before I read “Far Outside the Ordinary.” This is Elrod’s first book and is, basically, self-published through her own publishing house called Leather Leaf Publishing.  It is not simply a memoir of the death of her husband.  It is written like chick-lit.  You learn that Prissy is putting on bronze lipstick. She cries in the arms of her black nanny.  She cries in the arms of the man she just hired to care for her sick husband.  There is a lot of crying.More importantly, the last 72 out of 254 pages are about the romance between Prissy and her second husband, largely through AOL (“you’ve got mail”) email.  The cute exchange of messages ultimately leading to their union was not what I expected in this memoir, nor did it interest me.  Typical of the prose was Prissy’s phone call to her girlfriend to help her decide whether she should meet her intended wearing black pants and top or a brown and yellow sun dress.Prissy’s story is told from the perspective of extremely wealthy people.  Both Prissy and Boone seemed to have enjoyed extremely affluent backgrounds.  For example, in the summers of her youth Prissy spent the month of July at the Cloister, a venerable resort on Sea Island, with her Mother, sisters and black nanny.  Prissy’s mother commissioned an artist to paint old-world-style portraits of Prissy and her sister, so Prissy did the same for her daughters. On Prissy’s first date with Boone, he took her to his grandmother’s winter home, Waverly Plantation, where he lived alone while attending law school.The family continued to have significant financial resources.  Prior to Boone’s illness, Prissy was not working, had two children (one 19 and the other 16 years old) and relied on a housekeeper two days a week.  The family had a beach house on St. Teresa Island, on the Gulf of Mexico.  One of Boone’s hobbies was large game hunting.  Annually, he and his friends paid a lot of money to hunt “some of the finest bull elk, cow elk, bear and wild birds in North America” on the Mescalero Apache reservation in New Mexico, with the associated taxidermy. When Prissy realized that wheelchair-bound Boone should have time outside, she didn’t build a ramp but had a deck built on the rear of the house so he could be rolled outside.Prissy is a physician’s daughter, yet she made illogical decisions.  When Boone was initially diagnosed with brain cancer, she found a medical center and outstanding surgeon from the latest recommendations of U.S. News and World Report, yet she paid $900 for a Chinese foot soak treatment guaranteed to travel from his feet to his brain, where it would miraculously dissolve the lethal tumor.She and Boone moved from their home in Tallahassee, Florida, to Houston for several weeks to get controversial, unproven, alternative medicine treatment at the clinic of Stanislaw Burzynski, touted as able to cure inoperable brain tumors.  According to Prissy, the government spent years “suppressing” this cancer treatment and trying to “put this pioneer scientist and inventor in jail.” According to Prissy, “Burzynski was indicted for fraud and seventy-five counts of violating laws; some of these events were taking place at the time we needed him.”The initial fee for treatment at the Burzynski Clinic was $10,000 with an additional “$7,000 to $9,500"" per month, according to the American Cancer Society.  In short, Prissy became responsible for administering the treatments ordered by the Burzynski Clinic, which became a painful ordeal for Boone as the weeks passed and his condition worsened.Prissy hired the following caregivers for Boone: a black man named “Du,”  his “sister” Sallie, and Willie, a substitute black man who, according to Du, occasionally volunteered at Du’s church.  Prior to their hiring, Betty, the housekeeper, helped Prissy care for Boone.Du and his alleged sister were compassionate, experienced caregivers, and good with Boone, but no mention was made of any training.  They both moved into the house and Prissy became dependent on them and involved in their lives. Du's “sister” turned out to be his girlfriend.  Du’s mother became terminally ill and was admitted to the hospital, and Willie was actually a homeless alcoholic and drug addict (he seemed stoned when Prissy found him on the street) who lived in a shelter.  Prissy helped Du divorce his wife, helped Sallie when her son was arrested and jailed and generally tried to solve their problems because she relied on them to care for Boone.  Du recruited Willie from the homeless shelter when Prissy felt that she was “living on the set of some B-list soap opera.”One might wonder why Prissy, an educated person of means, did not hire a trained, experienced caregiver, perhaps from an agency, to care for Boone.  Maybe qualifications were not relevant for Prissy, since, following Boone’s death, she did get a job as a legal secretary to the deputy general counsel to the governor of Florida based on her connections but with absolutely no training or experience.Some of the reviews mentioned that they laughed at parts of this memoir.  However, any humor escaped me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXE9WAX078PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082530783X#wasThisHelpful","R3IXE9WAX078PG","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anyone who has been to Everglades City or even smaller Chukaluskie knows what a small, insular community it is – and how easy it would be to become completely lost in the Ten Thousand Islands region of the Everglades.  When I went there in the 1980's, I was amazed at the number of expensive cars and boats parked or docked at what looked like very modest houses.  It wasn't until a year or so later, when I read that more than 200 people had been arrested for smuggling marijuana, that I understood the attraction of the Ten Thousand Islands for smugglers and the reason behind all the cars and boats.Tim McBride tells a “stranger than fiction” story about this period in time – one in which smugglers could easily make tens of thousands of dollars a night, and a team of smugglers could net as much as a cool million dollars for transferring a load of marijuana from an offshore freighter to pickup points elsewhere in Florida.  The book tells of outwitting the local police; the hard work involved in moving the bales of marijuana from freighter to boat, from boat to dock, and from dock to other towns; and -- lest you be tempted to try this yourself – the ultimately inevitable arrest and jail time.  To hear Tim tell it, everyone was friendly, no one poached another guy’s marijuana even if it was found floating in the water, and the biggest problem was trying to figure out what to do with all the money.  (Hint:  buy your buddy a truck – with cash – on a whim.)The contrast between that environment and most other large-scale drug smuggling operations that you read about, featuring double crosses, guns and killings, is astonishing to read.  And if you have been there, you almost certainly will read about the places where you have been: dinner at the Captains Table, camping on Rabbit Key, and the juncture of the Turner River and US 41 where teams of smugglers sometimes unloaded bales of marijuana into trucks.  The book is certainly not great literature, but it is an interesting and entertaining read, well worth the investment of a couple of hours of your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R191ZNT80GMPFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250051282#wasThisHelpful","R191ZNT80GMPFZ","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She digested the kangaroo food as well as all the other Limited Ingredient dry food. So, I ended up buying exotic meat as a novelty.It has 5 stars because it keeps my dog healthy and happy.

"Author Amanda Williams uses a mix of chick-lit overtones, the standard female private detective character, and police procedural to create an engaging murder mystery. Detective novel fans will recognize bits of the female private detective formula of Janet Evanovich’s Stephanie Plum and Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Milhorne.Keye Street, the protagonist and female detective is, as usual, flawed but brilliant. She is a recovering alcoholic, with continuing struggles with her addiction.  Keye worked with the FBI as a criminal investigative analyst and profiler.  Having been fired for being drunk, she now is a private detective, bail recovery agent and process server with her own business in Atlanta.Street has a serious relationship with a manly cop but is not immune to temptations presented on the job, like Sheriff Ken Metzler who exudes testosterone and animal magnetism.Keye is more competent than Stephanie Plum, able to actually retrieve her bond enforcement bail jumpers.  Yet, like Stephanie, Keye returns home to her man covered with orange juice and coffee resulting from a process serving mishap.“Don’t Talk to Strangers” is engaging, entertaining and well written with good plot twists.  It’s not goofy and humorous, but an analytical, procedural murder mystery.  “Don’t Talk to Strangers” is the third of William’s Keye Street series and the first for me.  It works as a stand-alone novel, but inspires me enough to read the others in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM12WXI1Z037/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553808095#wasThisHelpful","R2HM12WXI1Z037","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although this spatula is designed to clean out jars, being long and narrow, I like it for baking. I just used it when making a large cheesecake. The cream cheese, sugar, eggs and flour must be beaten until totally smooth to avoid lumps of cheese in the cake. The batter looks like mayonnaise when finished. To achieve this result, when mixing you must clean the beater and the bowl, several times, to incorporate the unmixed material. This jar spatula was superb for reaching into the bottom and wiping the sides of my Kitchen Aide bowl, with the beater still attached. The best part is that it will fit into the openings of the flat beater where unmixed batter accumulates. This spatula is stiff enough to clean both beater and bowl effectively. I have no doubt that it will clean out jars just as efficiently.The one-piece design of the spatula enables thorough cleaning, with no trapped food, and prevents the spatula from accidentally coming apart during use.  Also, the non-wood material of the handle is sanitary, being dishwasher-proof.The description of the spatula states that it is heat-resistant up to 600F, which means that it can be used to sauté food in non-stick pans. We'll see how that plays out after a longer period of use. I just threw out a spatula with the same claim when it left bits of plastic in the food.Like all OXO products, it has the ""Good Grip"" design of the very comfortable handle. This is nice when you are manipulating a spatula to clean out a jar or bowl.The OXO Jar Spatula is a bargain at $6.99.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B1O75FDOCPWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESCL0KA#wasThisHelpful","R3B1O75FDOCPWQ","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fad Diets are stupid. Author Rebecca Harrington is a really smart person who wrote a book about this stupid subject. Celebrities hold limited interest for me, perhaps not so for others. This book was probably a bad match for me.Rebecca Harrington is also rather young and quite thin. She does not need any diet. She certainly does not need Beyoncé's Master Cleanse diet, inspired by Tom Hanks, who lost fifty pounds for his role in ""Cast Away.""Okay, I realize that authors do stupid things so they can write about them. A.J. Jacobs spent a year living ""Biblically,"" doing what the literal reading of the Bible instructs. Then, he wrote an informative, entertaining book about it. He also read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica, then wrote ""The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World,"" which was also rather interesting.I guess Harrington's 161 page book on her experience following 14 celebrity diets, in my view, did not provide adequate material for an entire book. It did reveal some of the absolutely bizarre ideas on nutrition of famous people, but it left me hungry (sorry). Note: the pre-publication version that I read did not contain illustrations, so I cannot comment on them.Hilarious? I wasn't laughing. I found it mildly amusing, at best. Yes, I do enjoy humor, but more like Laurie Notaro, Bill Bryson or J. Maarten Troost. Maybe I'm just too old for this . . . my days of fad diets are long behind me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE53NHQG9QRXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101872438#wasThisHelpful","RE53NHQG9QRXA","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This knife is in between a paring knife and a chef's knife.  Much like a futon (is it a bed or a couch?), it's not good at being either.  The blade isn't very wide and doesn't extend at the base, so when chopping, your hand hits the cutting board.  You can't hold it in your hand for control as you would with a paring knife, unless maybe you have gorilla hands, which I don't The blade is very sharp and it does have a nice feel to it.  It actually cuts tomatoes nicely.The packaging is still giving me nightmares.  It's the heat sealed thick plastic kind, but there's also a thick zip tie type thing at the base.  I've seen the lifehack where you use a can opener to open clamshell packages, but it didn't occur to me at the time.

"I used this Shampoo to wash my motorcycles. As claimed, it removed the dirt without dulling the finish. Yes, I had to work on removing grease, but that's expected. A little on a sponge seemed to go a long way.The reason that Einszett isn't getting 5 stars is that it is competing with S100 Total Cycle Cleaner, which I have used for 15 years. S100 is such an effective cleaner, that my husband uses it on his Porsche.  It, too, is non-acid, pH controlled, contains corrosion inhibitors, and is biodegradable. Although Einszett seems to clean equally well, it can't compete with the price and convenience of S100. Amazon sells S100 at $14.95 for 33.8 ounces. It's even less expensive when you buy the 1.32 gallon Amazon sells the Einszett shampoo at $11.90 for only 16.9 ounces! Also, the S100 comes with a convenient spray bottle. This prevents accidental spillage, which did occur on the driveway with the Einszett. It is interesting to note that both Einszett and S100 are made in Germany.In short, although Einszett shampoo cleans well, S100 cleans as well or better at half the price and comes in a nice spray bottle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTCIG2JM6CY1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TW8R4S#wasThisHelpful","RTCIG2JM6CY1J","A39NB225G8LYPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39NB225G8LYPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While reading ""Mr.  Bones"" I kept telling my husband that he just has to read this book.  It is so good that I couldn't wait to share it with him.What brilliant writing and amazing imagination!  ""Mr.  Bones"" has aspects of Stephen King style weirdness, but on a more sophisticated level.  Theroux gives us twenty short stories of varied settings and styles, from four to fifty pages in length.  Their commonality is that all are artfully written and ingenious.Three stories are actually collections of vignettes of a page or two in length.  Yet, Theroux is able to convey compelling images and events in this short space.  I am at impressed with the effective characters and scenes he creates in just a page.A general theme of ""Mr.  Bones"" is that people are strange, even grotesque, in behavior.  Often we witness the gradual disintegration of a person.  These are fascinating portraits of bizarre experiences and characters.Theroux's nonfiction writing of people and places has been critical, even controversial.  I sense that ""Mr.  Bones"" may capture Theroux's impressions of people, on an exaggerated level.""Mr.  Bones"" loses one star due to poor endings.  The stories are magnificent, but just tail off.

"These sardines are bland and a little dry (I made the mistake of draining the sauce which these probably needed for added moisture). The first can I opened had two medium-sized sardines (which is a nice choice for a light snack).These cans have easy open pull-tops and are about the same exact size as a small 6- ounce can of tomato paste. Some of the cans had minor dents but nothing major and the packaging was well done. The expiration date on these cans was very good [Feb. 08, 2017].I'm a bit surprised these cans of only two [dry] sardines have 8 grams of fat though.

"We use a lot of Olive Oil in our home , and frequently use infused Olive oils , so when I was offered a chance to receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion , I decided to give it a try .This oil comes in a good sized bottle , and the bottle is actually full ( unlike others I have purchased where you literally get maybe half a bottle full ) the spray nozzle works very well to spray on exactly what you need .This was a very surprising flavor burst ! I honestly was not expecting how great this was going to taste and actually had hesitations about this . The first time I used this , I wanted to play it sale so I used my QO Lemon infused Ive Oul on some broiled Talapia. I only used this with half of our Fish as I was worried that no one would like it , yet it was a big hit ! The smell itself is so amazing and has a tangy Citrus Aroma that you will get s whic of when you open the oven or if you are frying or sautéing anything , just wow !  If you are a frequent Oluce Oul user , you will easily be able to tell. The difference between this and a typical olive oil .The taste was not overpowering at all , it has just the right amount of lemon Infused in to this that will please even the most picky eater . If you allow your meats or other proteins to rest after using this QO Infused oil , it also gives the oil flavor s chance to set in so that you are sure to get an exciting taste every time .Overall , this is a good , high quality Lemon infused Olive Oil that will be enjoyed by all , made with a great quality Olive oil and works well for everything we have tried it on so far .I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience .","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVCTEPBY1X3LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EYXZ0K#wasThisHelpful","RVCTEPBY1X3LQ","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first received this tablet I honestly did not expect that I would use it much and that my kids would be the ones who used it . I have been using my iPad and Kindle PaperWhite for years now and live them both even though I love the Windows platform more than any other .When I received this , the first thing I really noticed that stood out to me was the size . I love that the actual screen size is large and easy to read and see . This also has Zoffice 365, which is a huge plus , because with most any other tablet , you have to either download some type of app for those programs or get another similar program that mimics Office , or worst case scenerio , you have to pay extra , but this tablet has it included . It also has several other things already added that you use most often .This tablet comes with a very nice case that fits perfectly and is a nice quality case . The case is actually a keyboard case that hook the keyboard right to the tablet so you can use the touchscreen or the keyboard ( I prefer the keyboard for everything other than games )Setting up the tablet is very simple . It is just like setting up your laptop or PC with the Windows operating system . You choose your user name , password , time zone , etc then you will set up your wireless connections . The other tablets we have in our home all connect through our lower bandwidth WiFi but this IRULU tablet connected right to our high speed higher bandwidth modem so that was another HUGE plus for me. Once you get to the main screen where you see all of your goodies and it all looks exactly like your typical screen on your laptop except better .The picture on this IRULU tablet is great . The colors are perfect and spot on with what they should be . To test out exact how the colors were , we decided to watch Mickey Mouse on it while watching it on TV as well ( different shows but we mainly wanted to see how Mickey and friends looked so we could compare ) my son also had his Samsung tablet out and did the same . I was completely surprised that this tablet had an excellent picture that was even better than my sons big name brand tablet . We did not have any lag issues or have to constantly wait for video to buffer . It all loaded fast and the picture was good quality , good colors and very clear . ( Many tablets , including my iPad , tend to have too much green or Red undertones in them , but so far I have not noticed that with this tablet , I will update if that starts to happen )The sound quality on this is also good . I think if you turn it up super loud and add speakers then it gets distorted , but that happens with most anything you do that too . I did have to turn the volume up quiet a bit just to be able to hear it enough to watch a video , but once we got it to the volume level that we could hear , the vume was good and clear , it stayed steady without any interruptions .The sound and the video stayed in tune with each other , thankfully we didn't have any lips moving before the words actually came out of their mouths .The processor on this tablet seems to work very well and is quiet fast . We have used this on and off line without any issues so far at all . This has 1 gb tam which is really good for a tablet and I have put several movies and games on here so far in case my grandson wants to watch movies or play while we are driving or just relaxing at home .The camera on this takes a really good picture . It is right on par with the camera on my iPad and iPhone , and it has good focus on it .You have easy access buttons for your email , but nyer et explorer, facebook , camera, messenger , Google maps and more .Overall I am giving this tablet a solid 5 stars . You really cannot find a better high quality tablet at such an amazing price . This has everything you need on a daily basis , that you can easily take with you everywhere you go . The WiFi will connect anywhere , we have so far connected at home , McDonalds , Starbucks and at two other places with no problems at all . This tablet is fast , it has all the bells and whistles plus the added extras such as the keyboard case and the high pixel camera and I would highly recommend this to anyone . This would make an excellent gift for a teen or pretend first tablet , it's great for school or college and college kids can easily carry in bookbags without lugging around bulky laptops .I did receive this at a disclaimer by in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with this IRULU 9"" Windows Tablet PC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6BHTSUNLXFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R3H7L4#wasThisHelpful","R1D6BHTSUNLXFX","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was first offered a chance to receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I was hesitant, I know how cats like to scratch and claw at things and had never used any soft carriers for cats before, but decided I would go ahead and give it a try ( AND if it didn't work for the Cat, I figured I could always let my girls use it for their stuffed animals, which I fully expected that was where it would end up)The first thing I noticed about this Pawfect Pet Carrier was how well made it is. The Carrier is made from High quality heavy duty materials. The material that the main part of the carrier is made of, id=s nice and thick and very strong. The Mesh on the sides and front is a thicker type of mesh that if you have a cat inside here, the cat will not easily claw through or in case of a dog or puppy, chew through. The form of the carrier is hard to help it hold the ""Pawfect"" shape that you need for the carrier to work.The handles on this case are amazing. We all knwo that just because your animal may be small enough to fit in here, doesn't always mean that they are small in weight. I have a Pug, he looks like he would be very light, but he is a former show dog and is very muscular and weighs in now at 27 pounds but only looks like he would weigh about 16-18 pounds. So the fact that I can put him in this carrier and actually pick him up and the handles hold firm, that shows me how well made and study they are. The handles also have a comfort part of the strap which is where you would typically carry it with which will protect your hands, shoulders, etc while you carry them. I read previous reviews that said the sides caved when they used the handles to carry the pets, but frankly, I honestly did NOT have that issue even though after reading the other reviews, I was expecting too, hence the reason I tried using my heavier dog that fit inside here.The inside of the carrier is very roomy, much larger than you would be expecting. The carrier has a solid hard flat piece to put on the bottom which also helps with the frame, to hold the shape of the carrier and then you place the nice fluffy and comfy padding that is included on top of the bottom form for the comfort of your pet. This also has a back pocket on the carrier where you can store a leash, small bag of food, collapsible water bowl, waste bags, etcNow, the funny thing is that I actually got this carrier for my Brother in laws Cat, he is attached to this cat, and when he was forced to move to a new apartment because the apartments he was living in, one caught fire which went over in to the others, he had to move, and the new place he found that was available and in his price range, did not allow pets, but he refused to give the cat away. So, having no other choice, he moved in to this "" NO pets allowed "" Apartment, even though we advised against it. He has inspections once a month, so each month on inspection day, he gets up really early, packs the cat, some litter, food and toys and walks his cat to our house where she stays in our garage for the day while he awaits the end of the monthly inspections. He literally carries her in his arms and walks the probably 1 mile here, then 1 mile back , because the cat hates the car ( he doesn't drive but we always offer rides) then when she is here, if my husband or I need to use the garage for anything, we have to first go out and put her in a small wire cage I have here for my dogs.His cat loves, loves, loves this carrier! As soon as I took it over to him when I received it, he set it up and just left it open, she started going in and out of it and eventually layed down inside on the comfy padding. Now you can frequently find her napping or relaxing inside of this instead of on top of the chair,couch or windowsill. So when he made the trek over to our house today, he said she had no issues being in the carrier while he walked here, she still screamed when we attempted to drive him home because it was raining, so he made us stop and he got out with his umbrella and walked the remainder of the way, but at-least he no longer has to worry about her jumping out of his arms and running off or getting hurt, and we no longer have to worry about catching her to put her in this wire cage in out garage because she was in the carrier every time we went to the garage today!Overall, a solid 5 stars for a well made, comfortable  and roomy carrier.I did receive this Pet Carrier at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based onpersonal experiences with this carrier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R409ZDI2KI5M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMHCLBW#wasThisHelpful","R409ZDI2KI5M9","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You really can do so much with a blank canvas, and these bags are basically like a blank canvas and the sky is the limit.The first thing you will notice with these is that they are very well made. The Bags themselves are nice and thick, not flimsy like so many other brown bags like this that you buy. They have strong handles that are perfectly rounded and attached to the bag very securely so that you do not have to worry about the handles coming loose from the bag itself. These really are made from high quality paper and materials.So, what can you do with these bags? You can really do a lot. If you plan to use these as Gift Bags, then these can be used just as they are and would look cute if you add some tissue inside and a name tag, or you can pretty them up by adding some curled ribbon and different colored tissue paper inside with a nice sparkly name tag ( or any name tag really) and you can decorate the outside with markers ( We found that chalk markers actually work great on these bags and hold the color well without bleeding through ) or if you are crafty, you can get some cute prints of Duct Tape and make some shapes of even just random small strips and place sporadically on the bag and use long strips as your ribbon, cut it in half then fold the halves and drape it over the bag after securing it to the handles. Or you can use Duct Tape or decorative tape and make a striped pattern by doing a strip then leave a space then add another strip ( makes a cute chevron pattern )These bags hold quiet a bit. They are much larger inside than I actually expected and the bottoms are strong and well made. We actually had one bag filled and it weighed almost 8 pounds total and the bag still looked great and was not buckling or bulging at all and the bottom had no issues holding it. You will not have to worry about the glue coming loose or basically becoming so dry that the bag comes apart, as this is well secured , as all bags should be. ( However, we know that not all bags are made the same, thankfully these are great because I will admit I was worried when I first ordered them that they may end up being ""crispy"" as in dried out and falling apart)I think these would make great bags if you are giving away goody bags at an adult or kids party, Teacher Holiday Gifts and letting your child(ren) decorate them for each teacher themselves or for playing a fun game of your own version of dirty Santa or secret gift exchange.Pro's :Well MadeHeavy Paper ConstructionBottom securedExcellent handles properly securedCan be used ""As Is"" or decoratedLarge insideCon'sNoneOverall, I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely buy more of these, they are going to be great for Christmas and Birthdays ( We have 7 children and 2 grandchildren so we go through a lot of nags and a lot of craft projects, so score for us on this product) I would recommend these to anyone considering these as an option especially for the upcoming Holiday season.

"I love Gardening. The fact that these garden tools are much higher quality than I have found so far has really made these my favorite tools to work with. I just recently got these just in time for planting my fall bulbs and I was amazed at home much difference the stainless steel tools make when you are using them.I love how well made these are. they are one piece, which makes a difference when you are not worrying about the handle breaking off from the actual tool end. The soft grip handles make it easy for someone like me with Rheumatoid Arthritis to easily grip the tools with comfort and not have to worry about hand cramps as much or as often.The tools also come in the own carrying pouch and case. This makes it easy for me to not only put them away and not worry about rust, but I can easily grab them and head outside without digging through the shed ( I hang the handle on a hook right inside the shed door and just grab them and go )The bag itself is well made with heavy duty, high quality materials. the stitching on the bag is done excellently with no dropped or loose stitches.

"High Quality, real cork, good to use not only for Wine making but for crafts as well. We love to make our own wine , so these will come in handy for that. These corks are very high quality. You will not find this quality just at your typical craft store. If you are going to use these for crafts, they will be excellent for most any project. These corks, as stated are #8 and about 2 inches in size, you can cut these down to the size you need if you do not plan to use the entire cork. The corks cut clean with no worry about crumbling.You will notice that these corks are softer than the ones you normally see, which is a plus, it allows you to cork your wine, and then the corks expand the fit your bottle to seal your wine.when crafting, these corks will easily hold the glue from a hot glue gun. They will also be super cute in a wine jug filled to the top with corks, or a decorative jar as a centerpiece, the options really are limitless with these. They have a nice, intricate design on the corks that displays an actual corkscrew and if you put three pieces or the corks together, you can actually see how the full picture would look, which would make a great craft in itself.If you are searching for some great, well made, high quality #8 corks, then these are the ones. They are not only well made, but they have all the qualities you would look for in a cork for corking homemade wine, or bottles or already opened wine, as well as crafting.I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are based on my personal experience with these corks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQSZ8FPINJLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HH24BI#wasThisHelpful","R3QQSZ8FPINJLS","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazingly soft, very functional, perfect for any new baby. I had purchased many bamboo baby products over the past few years for my grandchildren, and some of them had been rather rough instead of soft and cuddly, so I had really hoped that this one would not be . Thankfully, this was just beyond my expectations not only in comfort but in quality.The towel is a hooded towel which is 30 x 30 and will work well from newborn up until probably 9-12 months, really depending on the size of the baby, you may be able to use it longer. The quality is excellent, so you can definitely pass it down to another little one once you have finished with it. This is soft enough that you will not have to worry about it scratching the delicate skin on a new born and you can use it from the first day you bring them home from the hospital. The washcloths are made from the same materials and are just as soft as the towel. They are a good size, about 10 x 10 and perfect for washing your little ones.The bib is amazing. This is a bib that I owuld have wanted on my kids when they were small. My oldest had very sensitive skin and we could never find a bib that would not break him out under his chain where it hooked. So this would have been a home run for us.  This bib is great from the time you bring them home ( you know all the spit up and drool that dribbles down) and will be able to use for several months as well.This entire set washes well and holds its shape even after many washes. It is very vibrant in color and the color stays just as vibrant as well after many washes.Overall, an excellent set, well worth the money that would be a great gift or a great purchase for your own little one.I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with this Bamboo Moon baby Gift Set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOUGJIUU359K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131IGHS6#wasThisHelpful","R3QOUGJIUU359K","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a fun clock! I personally am a Math buff and love all things math, my older kids are the same way but my younger kids really dislike Math, so when I was offered a chance to receive this clock at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, I decided I would give it a shot and get this in hopes that my younger ones would see the benefit of it.Thankfully they loved it. They immediately went to work and can now do these problems with the best of them. The clock itself is well made, the hands are attached very well to the base of the clock and the battery compartment is also attached well so you do not have to worry about anything coming loose. This has an easy to hang hook on the back so that you can hang this with ease pretty much anywhere you decide to hang it.

"I can say with confidence, don't waste your money unless these are suppose to be a toy pair and I just missed that part of the description. I do see where they say for Cosplay or decorative purposes, so for that, they are perfect, because otherwise they are very cheap and have no real value. I doubt a kid could play with them for more than a few minutes without them breaking.They do look like what you see in the picture, although a little shinier, a little more plastic looking. These are very fragile. From a distance, if you are using these for a staging, then they would be great. I think they do look very authentic for that era as long as you are not looking at them up close.Overall, I will give these 4 stars simply because they do say for cosplay or staging.I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1925UTYTBP6S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPXXEOC#wasThisHelpful","R1925UTYTBP6S6","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are adorable. These brought back so many memories when I saw them that I just had to have them. I had an Aunt who collected Salt 7 Pepper Shakers and she always said that one day she would have ones that looked like Ketchup and mustard, but she never found them before she passed away, so these were just meant for me it felt like.These salt and pepper shakers look exactly like you see in the pictures. I love how well made they are. They are made from ceramic, and appear hand painted. The holes are a little large, but if you pay attention when using them, then you will have no problems. I personally plan to have them for decor purposes and maybe save them for summer gatherings or family gatherings just to show them off so we can tell a story or two about Aunt Bessie & Her collection ( she had over 2,000 when she passed)The basket that these sit in is a harder type wire that is very sturdy and super cute and really completes the overall package.

"I have tried so many different product since I was first diagnosed with my first Brain tumor two years ago, and as you would expect, nothing helped, always hoping and looking for my miracle drug or supplement and obviously have yet to find it, but this Pure Black Shilajit has made me feel better than I have felt in the past two years .I tried this a couple of different way, in water as a drink form and by simply making a pea sized ball and swallowing it like a pill. The taste is not great, so I chose to use it in a ball and swallow like a pill, but my husband likes the drink form. I have never tried Shilajit in any other way or form, not from any other company, and after using this, I feel like this is a winner for me, and I will continue to use this PurBlack Shilajit.I also have an Autoimmune disorder that basically means that any possible germ or virus that gets near me, makes me sick. Most times, if I go to my kids school or have my little ones around ( grand-kids) , I will end up sick for a few days after with whatever germ just happened to be passed around that week. PurBlack Shilajit  has not totally made my immune system where I can avoid all of this, but it really has made a noticeable difference. It has also made a huge difference in my overall attitude and the way I feel about life when I wake up and go through each day. Case in point was that I had my Grandson and Granddaughter over the weekend and we went to a popular outing for kids, normally I would expect to be sick all week from this, granted, I usually just keep pushing on, but this time I did not get sick at all. Was it because i had been taking this? I honestly cannot say for certain but I have not done anything else different and any other time in the same situation I would have had a virus of some sort after that.This actually may remind you of Tar, and even has the consistency in its rare form of tar, but it doesn't taste like tar and if you do add it to a drink, you really can't taste it much. ( I just prefer to swallow it because hey, the faster you get it down, the better right? )I have more energy than I have had in two years, to the point where everyone around me has noticed, and if you knew the person I was before my Brain Tumor and the person I was just 3 weeks ago, you would notice as well and this is a difference that literally brings tears to my eyes. Imagine never feeling like leaving home, not just depression but a serious lack of overall energy. Brain Surgery, Chemo , Spine surgery and overall bad health issues and I am not even 40..my life was going on a downward spiral and i hated it, I felt helpless, so if this continues and I feel more energy everyday, then this will be my wonder drug for sure and as of right now, for me, it is my miracle.I think this would honestly be good for anyone. My husband is healthy and a normal middle age male, but once he started taking this with me, even he has felt better ( He didn't even realize he didn't feel at his best until he started taking this) AND he has more energy as well. So it's a win-win situation in my house and I can easily recommend this to anyone no matter your age,health ailment or overall demeanor.I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions stated all based solely on my personal experience with Pure Black Shilajit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBFEF250E4G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNI6Z5A#wasThisHelpful","RZBFEF250E4G4","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice quality cables. We always find ourselves in need of these cords around our home. They work on everything ( My kids Windows phones, PlayStation 4 controllers, my Kindle paperwhie, My girls Kindles, you name it) so we can never have enough of these, so finding this 6 pack was a good thing.I was impressed with the overall quality of these cords as well. One of the things I worried about most when I bought these was that they would be cheap and end up breaking easily ( you know how you get cords that end up breaking right at the tip and the wire4s coming loose? My worry! ) however, so far we have been using these daily on all of our electronic and they do not even appear to be coming loose at all and they work well with every device we have tried them on without issue.These are braided cords, which makes them a better quality from what I have found so far, and they last much longer than the typical cords you can get.

"When I first saw these boots in the picture, I knew I had to have them, they were awesome. So my expectations were high before they even arrived. These boots are decently well made. They have quality materials used on them. The stitching is done beautifully and no loose or broken stitches anywhere.I love the look of how the Dark grey comes down over the black and appears like you have chaps or pants on over the boots themselves. The Leather top is very nice.I did have some issues with these boots. First, they are narrow, and even though my feet are not that wide and normally do not have to get a wider shoe, I feel like maybe these should come in a wide option as well . The next issue is that the zipper on the side has no real function, so even though they fit me fine, if you have larger calves, I would not recommend these simply because the zipper will not loosen the top part of the boot , so if your calves are large you will not be able to get these on. ( I had no problem but were my calves a tab bit larger I would not have been able to get them on) The zipper actually looks like it would zip from the bottom up, which could be a cool look I guess, but not when it has no real purpose. Obviously it tells you on the listing that the zipper is non functional, so pay attention.The decorative stitching is neat, adds a nice touch to the boots themselves. The boots do feel nice when I walk in them, but I did have to take them off after just a few hours, where with normal boots I can wear them all day without issue. So maybe this was just an issue with breaking them in, as I have now worn them 4 times and still cannot wear them for a long time period yet.I did receive these boots at a discount in exchange for my honest review and all opinions are solely my own based on my experience with these boots,  which sadly I now see is regular price ( or sale price as they show) which leads me to feel like they only marked these up for a few days to make a few of us feel as if we were getting a discount . These boots are worth the $49.00, you will pay that or more for good quality boots no matter where you go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GTMU4ZCZYTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OXZC04#wasThisHelpful","R14GTMU4ZCZYTI","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure who has had more fun with this, myself or the little one. This is an innovative way to learn while having fun at the same time and kids will love it if you can teach them to write their ABC's and they can practice them on this glow board . Don't take all the fun out of it though, let their imaginations go wild and they can make anything they draw more fun here.This Glow board appears to be very well made. The board itself is thick and sturdy. You can attach one of the markers on the back of the board. You also have the suction cups which can pop out and stand up so you can display your child's artwork . This could also cut down on all the paper you use on a daily basis and all the papers you end up with on the fridge ( take those papers and add them to a scrap book instead then take a daily picture of your glow board to keep in a digital album)This has 8 LED light modes, so you can really experience different ways of fun on here. It does take 3 ""AAA"" batteries, but so far the ones we put in have worked fine since day one and we have been suing this daily. In addition to the board this also comes with  4 other markers in Yellow, Green, Orange & Pink so your little ones can really color it up! It also has an eraser cloth that you can use to wipe the board clean with after each use ( similar to a microfiber cloth you use to clean eyeglasses with in case you lose yours or want to pick up some extra's)Overall, I am impressed with how fun this is, much more than a whiteboard, similar to a light-bright in color, you can have hours of fun!

"Such a cute shirt. The first thing you will notice when you receive this shirt s how soft it is. That was an unexpected bonus because just looking at this shirt in the pictures, you would not expect it to be so soft and silky feeling.The shirt itself appears well made and although it feels heavy for a shirt, it isn't heavy when you get it on. The stitching is done excellently with no loose or pulled stitches. The material is great quality material that washes well.The shirt does hold it's form well after washing which was another plus, as so many clothing items tend to lose the original form after you wash them that I end up never wearing them again and I have worn this 4 times already.I love the ribbon in the front that lace up through the grommets. You can make it loose or tighter depending on your mood and your situation ( Lace it up tight for work or another equally covering situation and loosen it up for the sex appeal) The ribbon is a tab bit lighter than the wine color of the shirt which really sets the shirt off. You can dress this up with a skirt and boots or dress it down with some jeans and heels or boots. It can be an all occasion shirt for sure.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone and I personally cannot wait to try more of this brand ( I blog a lot about fashion and for the past 7 years have been searching for a great brand that I can use in my post that doesn't cost a fortune and have finally found it! ) As you can see in the pictures below, this shirt is gorgeous!I did receive this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZXQZQK7JCVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CBBE4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2NZXQZQK7JCVK","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I am honestly surprised at the awesome exceptional quality of this skirt. I was not expecting a skirt quiet as nice for the price, so it came as a very nice surprise.The first thing i noticed upon taking this out of the package was that this skirt is heavy, yet not so heavy that it would not work for any season. this is going to be perfect year around but especially based on the color I chose, I can wear it this fall and in to winter as well ( You can easily wear this in the summer also or Spring)  The material of the skirt is good quality and the stitching is great with no loose stitches, no pulls or strings.The skirt is nice and airy and looks exceptional with a pair of boots . You can pair this skirt with about anything but my favorite way is with a solid top, jean jacket and a pair of heeled boots or cowboy boots and you are set. You will want to most likely avoid heat drying this in the dryer and maybe if you are going to put it in the dryer use the cool or air dry setting for just a few minutes then hang it up to dry for the remainder of the time simple because of the material.The spandex in the skirt is a huge plus for me because I love that it has the ability to stretch a little to fit my referred style. I can turn down the top if I want the skirt a little shorter, or use the top to cover my Muffin Top and make the skirt a little longer.Overall, this is a solid 5 star skirt and as you can see in the pictures, it is beautiful and the color is stunning and a sure hit for Fall!i did receive this skirt at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my own experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GKJU7GJMF5LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AQ5SGS#wasThisHelpful","R3GKJU7GJMF5LD","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is always having something that needs Soldered around here either for home or for our business. Normally he buys a really high end name brand Soldering Iron but when i saw this one, I thought it was worth a try considering that the ones he had never seemed to last very long, especially not for the money we paid.One thing I noticed right off the bat with this one was that it was adjustable, with most irons you buy, the temperature is normally one setting and you do not get to choose that setting, so this was a plus.This Soldering Iron appears well made. It has a transparent handle so that you can see inside. The handle itself is made of strong heat resistant materials ( It feels much better for me to hold than some of the others we have had that ended up getting too hot for me to touch) The Tips and iron are also well made and heavy duty yet not so heavy that you have to worry about them.This also has two additional tips for the soldering iron which are very easy to put on, they are simply screw on, screw off.Overall, this is an excellent Soldering Iron which is just as high quality as the ones we have paid triple for . The Soldering Iron itself is well made, works well and has adjustable settings for different projects. A solid 5 star product.I did receive this Soldering Iron at a discount  exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with the Soldering Iron.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5EO9UPF8HYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JM4AW4#wasThisHelpful","R1L5EO9UPF8HYB","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously tried Grapefruit Essential Oil from another company and was not impressed  , so when I was offered a chance to receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, I was not really very keen on it, but decided to give it a try anyway.I am very happy that I did because thankfully my first impression based on the other brand I had tried was nothing like what real Grapefruit Essential Oil really should smell like at all.This has an amazing smell and has quickly become my favorite smelling essential Oil by far. It also has helped with my bruising, I tend to bruise so easy but using this right away, it has helped to cut down the amount of time I keep those bruises.As with any Essential Oils you use, I think you will find they have some benefits for your health as long as you can get them as pure as possible. It's really hard to tel which ones are pure anymore, especially on Amazon as it seems like there are so many on here that claim to be 100 % pure, yet I have had many that look and smell like nothing more than vegetable oil.  Thankfully, that is not the case with this one, I could not smell anything unnatural in this oil. I have ax excellent sense of smell and my husband often will ask me even if the stuff on the ground smells like Antifreeze lol. Seriously though, I am super sensitive to smells and many oils I have purchased over the past couple of years have went in the trash within minutes, but these ( I have the entire 10 bottle set of Oils by Natural Acres that I received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion)  are here to stay. I am comfortable using this and the other oils I received around my kids and pets . which really says a lot because I am really picky when it comes to what we choose to use around or home.The only issue I have with this was that when I opened up the box, the smell was really strong, and granted I had 10 oils in the box,and not one was leaking and one were wet or oily, but the smell was overpowering to the pint that we had the tie the box up in several small trash bags and put outside in our trash cans. I am not sure if maybe one had previously spilled in the box or around the box,  but thankfully none of mine had been spilled and my bottles were all good, so it worked out just fine for us.Overall, I will give these 5 stars.

I have used this in my diffuser to help when I have mixed some other oils that I really wasn't overly fond of the smells but needed them for the purpose. I have also used this oil to make my own wax melts for my wax burner that I keep in my living room. This is great for making your own sugar scrubs and bath salts as well.

"I am personally not a huge fan of any Beef sticks ( I am not much of a red meat person at all) but my husband loves beef sticks and is the type of person that can literally have a beef stick and be good all day until diner. The past few times he had picked one up, he said they had really just gone way off the grid in taste and they always tasted dried out, so I have been on the hunt for a beef stick that meets a man's high expectations ( We all know men and their beef, right? )I had never heard of this brand before but when I was offered a chance to receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, I knew I wanted to try them. When they first arrived, my husband did not get all excited like i had hoped, so I simply put the package  on his nightstand and waited......I didn't have to wait long because the draw of fresh beef sticks was just too irresistible to him and that night when he came to bed, you could see the longing in his eyes...for beef sticks!!!!Now, many women would be all upset that their men noticed the beef sticks with more enthusiasm than they did them, but, I did have more online shopping to do :) In the middle of looking at these amazing..wait..he was eating a second BEEF STICK!!!SO I had to ask..are those beef sticks good? Now, this is a man that mind you, as I said above, can literally eat one beef stick and not need anything else to eat until dinner, so this was surprising.  So, in between bites, he started explaining that yes, these beef sticks were really good, so I told him i needed more than just ""good"" to write a real review, so he thought that was an invitation ot go in to a never ending dialogue, however, these were his findings:Pro's:Very, Very juice - not dry at all and actually taste like beef, and much better than some well known name brands he has tried.You do not need vampire teeth to chew these, they are again, moist and the texture is great, not like you are eating a stick of beef jerky.Flavor: Super flavorful like a burst of beef with some spices mixed in ,unlike anything he has tasted before.Filling : much more filling than other beef sticks and seem to last longer after he eats one instead of being hungry again in an hour ( he told on himself there, I now know that he sneaks cheese, crackers and anything else easy throughout the day)Con's :It's hard to only eat just one because they are so goodUnable to find any locally ( so he has to rely on me to order more, so he needs to be really nice, I think a new diamond since I found these gems, right? )The wife who doesn't really eat beef ate one and now he only has 4 left ( I had to try it , ya know, I did need to taste for myself)The kids now want one to try also since they heard him talking about these and he doesn't want to shareOverall, these deserve 5 stars. They are made great, have amazing flavor ( they really do, I did try one and was superbly impressed and could actually see myself eating one of these every once in awhile and I would normally never touch a beef stick ever) The beef sticks are very moist and simply YUMMY!As stated above, I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQVFMHS4M6CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GBQMAU#wasThisHelpful","R2WQVFMHS4M6CS","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a garden lover and you can find me outside year around constantly making sure my plants and bushes are well cared for, so it's important to me to have good Pruning Shears at all times.  I liked the look of these and the idea of the bonus gloves, so when I was offered a chance to receive these at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I immediately ordered and hoped they worked okay.I am happy to report that not only do they work okay, they actually work really well. The Shears are well made, and really easy to grip. The handle appears designed so that it is actually easier to grip , and as I used them this morning for a couple of hours, I noticed that by the way the handle was designed, my hands did not tend to get as tired as they normally do with the large hard to hold shear handles I normally use.The Shears themselves are nice and sharp, and now that I have had the chance to use these for quiet a long time, I am impressed with how well they work on even thicker vines and plants that I sometimes have to get out the very large shears or hedge trimmers for.These also have a locking mechanism that works well. I had no problems locking and unlocking the blades when I needed to use then put them away.  The work very well for small jobs also and make nice clean cuts where you need them too.The gloves that come with these work well also, and have good grip on them ( amazing grip actually) and are made well and work perfect fro holding the shears or even grabbing vines from a Rosebush if you need too.Overall, 5 stars for a well made product that works well for what it is designed for.I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are based on my personal experience with these Pruning Shears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1FCGFIILZ60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010G4F6QC#wasThisHelpful","R2K1FCGFIILZ60","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun wig, especially considering the election is coming up fast. I think everyone who has seen this on either my kids or my husband playing around with it, knew right off the bat exactly who it was suppose to be .The wig comes in the typical package that you would see any costume Wig come in, and the wig itself is covered with a Wig net which you normally expect to see on higher end wigs, so that was unexpected but made me feel like right off the bat, this wig may be better quality than you would find in a Halloween shop and I was right.The wig does feel a little more like real hair than you find on your normal everyday costume wigs, and appears to be well made. I have 5 teenage boys who have all tried this on, as well as my husband, and they all have different size and shape heads and this fit any of them just fine, so I think anyone would be able to wear this with ease ( even a woman with a lot of hair, as i pinned all of my hair up and still was able to out this on and I have very long, thick hair )The wig is funny and would make a great costume piece even after Halloween, obviously since the election is just starting to heat up , this would be funny!Overall, it is a great costume wig, the hair stays in place, it fits anyone, does not lose ""hair"" strands that we have seen, and is just funny!I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZBYTVDNTBOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015I452K0#wasThisHelpful","R3HZBYTVDNTBOO","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first received this pillow, I can honestly say that I thought I had probably wasted my money, just based on the appearance and how it came. It was in this what appeared to be, very small carry type case that I thought no way could hold a full size pillow. Once I started to get the pillow from the bag, well, I was even more sure that I had wasted my money because this pillow was flat as a board, I mean that in every sense of the word.So I decided I had best read what this pillow bag said, because something just did not seem right. According to the instructions, you were to let your pillow fluff itself basically over the first 24 hours. So, while my pillow was ""fluffing itself"" I decided to wash the cover, as I was not a big fan of the smell. Many may like the smell, I am just super sensitive to all smells , so in to the wash it went.  I actually went about my business and forgot about the pillow until the next afternoon when I was making my bed and decided to see if the pillow was ready for me to try and  this thing was literally 3 times or more the size it was when I took it out of the package. I do like my pillows a little fluffier, so I helped it along and fluffed it up more as I would with any other pillow I have. Now, it was to my desired size. So, if you get this and it doesn't get as fluffy and thick as you would like on it's own, you can help it along just by doing what you would normally do with any pillow you own when you fluff them each day.  The actual pillow part of this appears well made, stitched very well.Once I had my pillow how I wanted it, I retrieved the cover from the wash and the smell has dissipated when washing, so I was happy with that, and the cover itself appears to be well made, no loose stitches or dropped or pulled stitches and the cover is nice and thick also. It was very easy to put the cover back on the pillow, even though the pillow was now full size. The cover had not shrank in the wash at all, and still held the same shape.  You can use any normal size pillow case on this pillow with the cover on it.I have now been sleeping on this pillow for about 4 nights. It is very comfortable. It does hold it's shape very well even when you are suing it nightly, and unlike any other memory foam pillow I have had, it does not ""sink"" in when you lay your head on it. ( My Pet Peeve with my other memory foam pillows I own already)  I have recently had major level 4 Cervical Spine surgery and finding a pillow that I actually like to sleep on has been a challenge. I actually prefer sleeping with 2 pillows but prefer having 3 on my side of the bed so that I can prop myself up if I need to ( I find that after this surgery, I am sometimes more comfortable simply sleeping in a semi sitting position but still require pillows to achieve sleep ) So, I think I will probably end up buying 2 more of these for me and a couple for my husband over time, as he likes the pillow also.This pillow is perfect for using behind your back when you are sitting up in bed, or even behind your back on the couch if you have spine issues or back problems like I do.  If you have tried other memory foam pillows and like them, then you will love this one ( or even if you tried them and didn't like them because of the way they sink in when you put weight on them) It's like using a form yet at the same time , soft pillow ( I know that is a contradictory statement but it really is an accurate one) It will stay fluffed for you and not sink in with weight on it, but will still feel super soft for you.I do suffer from major migraines brought on by Brain surgery a little over a year ago and find that the right pillow can help with my headaches, and my headaches do seem like they are a little less with this pillow, but it will take time to decide if this is from the pillow or not. I will update my review with my findings after I have used this for a month or two.Overall, I will give this 5 stars, well deserved. It is well made, holds it's shape, easy to keep clean ( The cover is removable at any time and you can wash this in your normal washing machine)I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, and all opinions are based on my personal experience with this Bamboo Memory Foam Pillow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFXY3VY5227G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGKH5KW#wasThisHelpful","R3EFXY3VY5227G","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the first things I noticed about this Wooden Oil Box was that is was well made. The wood appears to be quality and is beautiful unfinished wood. The box, though the wood is unfinished,is very smooth , you can tell that time and attention was spend getting this wood as it is so that you will not get splinters when opening, closing or moving the box.The Hinges are very well constructed, attached securely to the wooden box so that you will not have to worry about the lid falling off and your oils rolling across the room. You could easily varnish this with a clear varnish, or a darker wood stain to fit your personal taste, possibly even  do an intricate carving of your own or a burned on design if you wanted to really make it personal ( A great gift idea if you know someone who loves oils) Inside the box the dividers are secured and immovable . You can place your oils inside without having to worry that a divider will move ( which happened to me with another box I had and when the movable divider came loose, two of my oil collided and broke, which was a mess)The box has enough room for 52 bottles and also a place for your roller tubes. My oils all fit easily in to the spots , since this is designed just for that. I like the curved spots for the roller tubes, you can easily see which tube is which by the way this is laid out.This also comes with 6 Roller tubes, which are awesome for making your own oil mixtures. I made a sleep mixture, relaxation/stress mixture, allergy mixture and a headache mixture ( I use the headache one often and love that I now have a roller tube for this) It also comes with droppers for your oils and small round stickers that you can place on your oils so that you know exactly which one you are grabbing without having to pick up ever bottle just to find the one(s) you need.The roller tubes are well made, heavy duty and super easy to use and roll on. The droppers help you to get your oils in to the roller tubes as well so that you do not have to attempt any messy pour in's.Overall, I found this to be a great purchase worthy of 5 stars. The box is well made, well designed , and beautiful.I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are based on personal experience with this Oil Box and it's accessories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33GI05VVOC1D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168NLUFG#wasThisHelpful","R33GI05VVOC1D8","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been attempting my hand at drawing once again, after years of not even picking up a pencil for drawing. So, when I was offered a chance to get these colored pencils at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion opinion, I decided why not give these a try and pick up drawing again.The first thing I noticed was that the pencils themselves were already sharpened, and although one or two had broken off in the box at the tip, the colors displayed were very vibrant. ( Broken at the tip is not an issue, as this could happen with any pencil you buy that comes per-sharpened) These colors are awesome when they actually go on paper as well. Where many colored pencils end up not looking like the actual color they appear at the tip, these are actually more vibrant than they appear, so that was a huge plus.My son is an amazing artist, and takes advanced Art classes in college, he typically spends hundreds on good quality pencils, and will not even use typical colored pencils even when at home just playing around, so when I ask him to try these out and got the funny look, he picked them up and began examining them. He first said that the weight of an actual single colored pencil was a tad heavier than the ones you would buy from a big box or discount store. That was a good sign he said, because although artist like lightweight tools, that a little heavier of a colored pencil usually means they are higher quality and as long as they are not heavy like a normal #2 pencil, then they are good, so that was a plus for him. So off he goes in to his bedroom and emerges a couple of hours later and showed me what he had drawn with these, and the colors really do pop and his lines were clean and crisp, with no difference in the width that you might see from a normal pack of colored pencils a child would use.My son says that although these are not the highest quality of colored pencils you can buy, he would definitely sue these for his practice drawings or when he was home just creating art for his brothers or sisters or even possibly for his class work on those times when they are allowed to use different materials than the high quality ones that most of his lessons require. He really likes these and thinks that they would be great for any child who is truly interested in Art or for anyone who enjoys drawing or using good quality colored pencils without having to spend a fortune. He says these are quality made, and will give you a smooth even line when using them. A great buy on these from his perspective.Overall 5 stars because based on the quality, the way they portray on different types of paper ( we used typical drawing white paper, craft paper, canvas) these are well worth the money especially considering you get so many of these for such a good price1 Above average colored pencils!I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CR4V87S53PM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NZN4FE#wasThisHelpful","R10CR4V87S53PM","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A great muscle roller. This is my second product like this, and when my last one fell apart after just a couple of months, I was looking for one that would hold up longer I hoped.  After looking at the pictures of this, I liked the look of the handles better than some others, they appeared like the grip would be easier.The first day I received this, I started using it immediately, I have issues with muscles cramping, terrible sore muscles after a typical day for a medical condition as well, and my doctors said that if these helped, then I should use them. They also stated that this may be good for me to try on my legs in the evenings a couple of hours before bed to help with my leg cramps at night and it so has! This is awesome!The handles are indeed so easy to grip and hold while you roll, much easier than the previous one I had. The actual roller part of this rolls very easily , regardless if you are rolling this yourself or if someone is rolling it for you. I prefer to do mine myself except I will have my husband roll this over my back sometimes now when I just want to feel pampered, because it feels amazing. It's like a massage on a stick and much more affordable than the spa would be!Overall this is a good quality Muscle roller. I would recommend this to anyone who frequently works out, gets muscle spasms, has leg cramps or circulation issues or just wants a good at home massage.I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are based on personal experience with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPM2FKF46T89T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RKCWR6#wasThisHelpful","RPM2FKF46T89T","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently got back in to working out at the gym, but hated having to either bring a lock for a locker or hang my keys on the hook with everyone else and stick my valuables in places only women can:) So, this seemed like a good solution when I was offered a chance to receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I was concerned though because it was meant mainly for running and I am not quiet back to running yet.I had no need to be concerned, because this is an awesome Fitness belt that seems like it was made for everyday people like me who go to the gym or work out by walking at the park or through the neighborhood. Granted, I am sure this is great for runners since it was made for them, but I much prefer to think it works better for normal people too ( Not that runners are not normal hah)My 20 year old son actually tried this on as well and used it one day, and he is a runner, and he is insistent that he is going to buy one for himself, in the meantime , mine is hidden away because I like it too! He actually said that this seemed to adhere to his skin better than the ones he has yet it did not ""stick"" to his skin and that it kept his phone secure while he ran and he could listen to his music, he is not fond of Armbands, so this was a plus for him also.The belt is well made, the stitching is exceptionally done well, no loose stitches, dropped stitches or pulled stitches. The fabric is amazing, especially if you put it right on bare skin, you do not have to worry about road rash from this belt ( a.ka. scratchy clothing items or accessories ) because this fabric is very soft and breathable as well and even if you manage to work up a sweat while this is touching your bare skin, you can throw it in the wash and it will smell, and look as good as new ( Obviously I know this from my son wearing this and he runs in only shorts and shoes/socks )You have plenty of room in the hidden pockets of this belt so that you can carry your keys if you need, valuables, etc without having to worry about them falling out of pockets or like me, having to carry a purse or lock with you when you go to work out. I have an iPhone 6 and this also fits my phone perfectly, so when I hop on the treadmill at the gym, I can listen to my music instead of listening to the music they have playing or watching T.V.Overall, I would give this 5 stars. i have purchased other running belts before but this by far exceeds my expectations and I would recommend this to anyone. I also like the Lace Locks that come with this, I had never used those before even though I see them everywhere and in every shoe store i go in to ( Which, I will admit, is alot) and the lace locks can get fairly expensive, so this bonus was a good bonus and considering it is included in the price, it's a win-win situation!I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are based on my personal experience with this belt ( and one from a runner's point of view via my son as well)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZNA5EQRW6KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQFRL8I#wasThisHelpful","R34ZNA5EQRW6KC","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I have never cared for when purchasing a Yoga Towel, has been the non-slip backing that everyone seems to think adds something to a Yoga towel, but personally which I feel is a pain. This towel is perfect because nto only does it actually stay in place, I do not have little pieces that feel like rubber all over the towel that hold it in place.I really love the color of the towel as well, it is so bright and vibrant. The towel appears to be very well made, the stitching is excellent with no loose or dropped stitches, and no loose or pulled threads on the towel itself. The towel fits nicely on your Yoga mat and you can even use the ""sleeve system"" that is on the towel to tuck it on your mat if you so prefer. It does stay on better, depending on your actual mat size. If you prefer to lay your towel right on your mat without using the sleeve system, you can spray it with a touch of water so that you are not sliding around or , since most are doing Hot Yoga with this, obviously your sweat can take care of that too. hah.The towel is long, which was a plus for me, because i am tall and prefer my mats to be longer than most mats,and always buy longer ones, so this was a good investment for me. The towel is not super thick, which is even better, I love how it easily dries you but it is not so thick that you cannot properly dry off with it. No one wants a thick fluffy towel for drying off the sweat, so score again on this Yoga towel. Recycled materials also make this a favorite for me, because we could all do a little more of our share of recycling, or let people like NamaSTAY do it for you and you know you are buying quality recycled products.The towel is Microfiber, which is quick to dry you off and the towel itself dries just as fast. It is machine washable and after washing several times now, the towel looks just as good as it did the first day I used it. The applique on the towel is very detailed, and although it is at the edge of your towel, it does not in any way interfere in your Yoga workout.Overall, 5 stars for a well made, vibrant, quick dry yoga towel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7DN2OLV1T6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161J8UTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1A7DN2OLV1T6W","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my oils. The case I had before this one was one that was really hard to actually carry around, so when I travel, which is often, I would end up just putting a few oils in a small make-up bag and hoping i didn't need the others while I was away. This case is well made, the case is soft inside with a hard shell outside casing. The zipper is well done, with no problems zipping and unzipping ( I love that for once I have a case that the zipper does not stick on! )I like how the pink on this case is very vibrant and stands out against the black of the case. The handle is also well made and attached firmly to the case itself so that you do not have to worry about the handle suddenly coming loose and dropping your case.The inside of the case is protected by the hard shell outside but has a level of foam padding in which it has slots to add your oils for maximum protection so that your glass bottles do not break, and because it is foam and it expands, you can use a little larger bottles with this than you can the hard wooden or metal cases with just slots to add oils too.Overall, 5 stars for this case, it is well made, has great padding protection inside and works well for my oils at home or on the go.I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and all opinions are based on my personal experience with this case","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JL49SIXNLD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F8699S#wasThisHelpful","R3JL49SIXNLD4","A39VWX743LZPS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39VWX743LZPS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this mop for free in exchange for an honest review, and that's what you're getting. I personally found the video review another reviewer did to be most helpful for getting an idea of how this thing actually works. After trying it myself, I mostly agree with the three star reviews. This is just a mop. It didn't work particularly great on my (admittedly scary level of dirt) laundry room linoleum, and I wound up spot cleaning the worst spots with a rag. However, for my laminate wood floors, I don't know that I've found anything else to work so well. The spinning action got out just the right amount of water so the mop wasn't too damp, and it cleaned surprisingly well. I hate cleaning my laminate wood because it almost always has streaks. But this mop got it streak-free and clean in a very short amount of time using just vinegar and water. And my kids fight over who gets to mop because they love the spinning action. For that reason I bumped this up to four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18P6QR1TFMJ6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","R18P6QR1TFMJ6A","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time of writing this review, this set is on sale for less than $10. For that price, don't walk, run to get you some. That's a smokin' deal. Based upon the normal price of $24.95, I still think this is a good set. The tools look and feel like I would expect from something with the Cuisinart name. They have a nice weight, sturdy construction, and generous length so you can flip and grill without singeing your arm hairs. My only complaint, and the reason I took off a star, is because I can't see a good reason for the tongues to have silicone tips (which are not removeable). I didn't realize that this set isn't dishwasher safe and I put the tongues through the dishwasher, which resulted in spotted silicone, and it just feels weird to be using silicone on the grill anyway. Overall, this is a nice set, though, and if it's on sale, don't hesitate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1HP1CRVLU3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WF6C#wasThisHelpful","R3O1HP1CRVLU3N","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic mat for the price. It unrolls easily and stays unrolled during my practice, unlike some others I have tried that roll up partially and won't stay flat. From day one, this unrolled easily and stayed put. It has a great amount of stickiness/traction and I didn't have any problems with sliding. I like the design of it and the circles give me a frame of reference to help with my alignment. I'm not a huge fan of the pink color but it's not obnoxious and definitely not a dealbreaker. The only complaint I have is that the mat does have a mild smell when my face is right up next to it, but it's not too overpowering and it has seemed to fade over time. Overall, I think this is a great choice for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C31ESRRWNL5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSG9LQ4#wasThisHelpful","R3C31ESRRWNL5L","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This necklace has become my ""wear it with everything every day"" necklace. I've barely taken it off, even to sleep or shower. It's incredibly light-weight so I forget that I have it on, but it looks expensive. The chain is very delicate and almost disappears against the skin, so the butterfly itself is the only thing you really notice. I love that the color and the detail has invited many compliments, but it's casual enough for everyday wear. The only reason I took off a star is because the chain IS so lightweight, it tangles very easily when not on your neck. When the necklace arrived I had a really hard time untangling a knot in the chain. I've kept it on since then, though, so I haven't had further problems with tangles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQ0FS4LZ0GNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011NXDYN2#wasThisHelpful","R2KQ0FS4LZ0GNE","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the list of pros, in my opinion:* Relatively lightweight* Works fairly well for spot cleaning: spray the spot with the mister on the nozzle, let it sit a few minutes, give it a little scrub and the hand sucks it all back up.* You can clean until the battery runs out without needing to dump the 'gray water.' It held a surprising amount.* Ideal for hitting stains on the stairs, or for cleaning a section of upholstery/carpet in the car.* Doesn't take up too much space and fit on a shelf in my laundry room.But, there's also a list of cons:* Does not work while plugged in, so your battery has to be charged or you need to wait a few hours until you can use it.* Battery only lasts for 20 minutes. This was actually more time than I needed to do stains on an area rug, but if I was doing a whole stair case it would be annoying to stop in the middle to charge it.* How well it removes the stain is largely dependent on your level of patience and attention to detail since you are the one manning the hose and working on the stain. I am comparing this to the standard SpotBot, which you just set on the stain and walk away, then come back when it beeps and move it to a different spot.* Replacement cleaning solution can get expensive. I suggest mixing the minimum amount and then making more if necessary, rather than making too much and wasting it.Overall Impression:I've always liked Bissell Spotbots for hitting those stains in between a professional carpet cleaning. This is a nice addition to the line up, especially if you have carpeted stairs or fabric upholstery. The regular spotbot wouldn't work for those things. But if you are mostly going to use this on carpet, I still like the one that sits on the floor and does all the work. This will not replace a good cleaning by a carpet cleaner because it would take forever to do a large area, and your results will be inconsistent. It works as expected, but I wish it was also possible to plug it in to finish a job if the battery runs low.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMP0UQSD4LWO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QZQMF0#wasThisHelpful","RMP0UQSD4LWO1","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, we really like this thing. It works great for catching grasshoppers and observing them, and the price is reasonable. The reason I'm not giving it five stars is because of some misconceptions I had on this critter barn before we got it (based on the picture and the description):1. It does have a light, but it's tiny (run with watch batteries) and does not illuminate the whole cage like the picture would lead you to believe. It's hardly noticeable unless your room is very dim. My kids still think it's fun, I just don't find it much of a selling point.2. It does not have any sort of built in reservoir for holding water. I'm not sure exactly why I thought it did (maybe because water was mentioned in the description) but it's just a run-of-the-mill plastic rectangle with a lid. You can put water in it, for minnows and such, but to me it makes more sense to use it dry for catching bugs.3. The ""magnifier"" on it is just a circle of warped glass and isn't much help in seeing the bugs better. We haven't used that feature much.4. The plastic cover for the hole where you drop bugs in is easily lost. I wish there was a string attaching it to the lid. We may rig one up ourselves and there IS a hole conveniently already drilled in it so it shouldn't be hard.5. It's not very big, only about 6.5""x4,"" but it holds a lot of grasshoppers and it is light enough for little hands to carry around.Those are my only complaints. This isn't a true habitat by any means, but it's definitely a step up from the empty yogurt container we usually use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32BICVM60BBRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGUBWW#wasThisHelpful","R32BICVM60BBRV","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 5-tab set of dividers from Avery might be my favorite yet. They are NOT pocket dividers, so don't expect to hold or corral any loose papers with them, but if you have a large stack of papers in your binder that you want divided into sections, these can't be beat. The large white rectangle that you see on the picture is actually opaque so you can see through it to the sheet underneath. This is helpful because you can see what the next page contains without turning the divider. I love the thick color border on each one: it adds a pop of color to my binder without being distracting or obnoxious. The tabs fit perfectly in my binder: they are bigger than 8.5x11 paper so you can easily grab each tab, but they do not overhang the edge of the actual binder. I also like that the labels can be printed or hand written, and they are sized so that a thin border of color remains around the white. They look really clean and classy. I couldn't be happier with these dividers and will buy them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEIUE7YDU0BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5GC16M#wasThisHelpful","RNEIUE7YDU0BM","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to agree with another 3-star reviewer who stated that this reminded him of the shave he got from a cheap drugstore razor: the power just isn't there. In my husband's words, ""It just doesn't seem to have high enough rpm's to do the job well."" The motor is quiet, it cleans itself, it has a nice look and feel in the hand, but the actual shave wasn't anything to write home about. My husband has gone back to using his old Panasonic ES8243A Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Nanotech Blades for Men, which cost less and has been working fine for years. It's louder, yes, but the motor doesn't balk at a few days' worth of stubble and it gets the job done.

"I have a set of these towels with the red stripes. So far, after a month and several washings, they have held their color extremely well. The red has not faded at all and there is no bleeding onto the white or into the wash. They get softer with each washing and do work very well for drying dishes. I wouldn't say that they are ""magic"" towels by any stretch, and they don't necessarily work better than my ecloth microfiber cloths or other dish towels I have. They do dry glass quickly and efficiently and I haven't noticed linting or streaks. As far as the size goes, they have shrunk a bit and are no bigger than a standard kitchen towel.

"What to say about a book that took over 70 pages to reel me in, that I almost gave up on, and then suddenly found myself unable to put down?This book, to me, felt like a mashup of a John Green book and Daughter of Smoke and Bone. It is at times almost exhausting with its wordiness and cutesy font gymnastics, and yet captivating in its imagery. It's not one to give up on but to roll with and be swept along by and see where it goes.It manages to land on that tenuous precipice between books written for teens and books about teens that anyone can enjoy. I would have no problem handing this to my 15-year-old niece and knowing she would love it, and also recommending it to my married friends.Magonia sets the stage and pulls the curtain back on a world where ships sail the skies, unseen by the ""drowners"" living on Earth, surrounded by squallwhales and heartbirds and pirates. This book introduces Aza Ray, kidnapped in infancy and left with a human family, slowly drowning on human air most of her life.On the weirdness scale, this one ranks about an 8. There are birds that shift into bird people. There are blue skinned Magonians. There are little doors in people's chests where their heartbirds live. You have to not get hung up on that. Because much like the movie Avatar, by the end of the movie, the blue people look way more normal than the humans. It grows on you. It becomes familiar. It makes you want more.This book is balanced with well-developed and believable characters (yes, even the blue and bird-like ones), a light romantic thread of friendship-based love warring with a magnetic pull to someone of her own kind, and the unspooling of a bigger adventure to come.In a heavily saturated and overrun genre, Magonia managed to catch my attention and keep it, and left me asking myself this question.Yes, a fish may love a bird… but where shall they live?I can't wait to find out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SEFR9I76Y3T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062320521#wasThisHelpful","R1SEFR9I76Y3T8","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first installment of an ongoing series about a bunch of kids who are a part of a reality show much like the ""Amazing Race."" They've been divided up into teams and have to solve clues as they make their way through the different habitats, in this case, the rain forest. The storyline relies heavily on the reality show theme, and kids who are fans of the show will probably enjoy that.After reading this out loud to my family, and having two of my kids read it to themselves, here are the pros and cons from my perspective as a homeschooling mom:PROS:*the book includes interesting facts about several rainforest creatures and the habitat, weaving them in both the storyline and also as a few ""break out"" sections where a different creature is highlighted.*both my second and fourth grade sons were able to read it and enjoy it. The writing is at about a third grade level I would guess.* the pictures added a lot and were helpful in visualizing the different environments the kids were in*my kids are interested in finding out what happens nextCONS:*My kids haven't seen any episodes of the Amazing Race, so that aspect of the story was kind of lost on them.*I personally didn't care for the antagonists in the book actually being a group of kids on the other team who were the main characters ""good friends"" from back home. They had all applied for the show together and when they got there they found out they would be on separate teams. That would have been fine, but that other team of kids was the main source of conflict in the story as they cheated and sabotaged the main character's team. I am not sure what message the author is trying to send here, but it seems like an unnecessary source of conflict for this book. They are in the amazing, and DANGEROUS, rain forest... surely, that in itself could have presented enough challenges without diabolical scheming from people he considered his friends.*This book only covers the first leg of the race. You have to wait for, and pay for, the next two or three books in the series in order to find out how the race ends. That may really frustrate some kids.OVERALL:This is a good reader for a second or third grader. I didn't enjoy it very much as a family read aloud, mostly because I felt like the interpersonal drama and dialogue distracted a bit from their adventure. I also didn't particularly like the attitude of the kids in the story and my children didn't really relate to them, but they were still intrigued by all the fun things they got to do and would like to know what happens next.

"I love these felt pads for protecting my hard wood floors. I used this particular set on my heavy kitchen farm table, and they have performed very well. I like that they are peel and stick, rather than having to peel an individual sticker off of each one separately. They applied in literally less than a minute, and I can now move that heavy table all by myself without scratching the floor. It slides very easily. It did raise the height of my table about 1/4"", but it is not noticeable and doesn't bother me.The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that the price seems a bit high. I have bought multipacks of pads like these at Costco (possibly a different brand) in the past and felt like a got a better deal.

"As far as canned coconut milk goes, this is exactly what I would expect. It's extremely thick (mostly cream with about 1/3 liquid) and is great for cooking and for recipes that call for ""one can."" When cooked it melts down into a wonderful thick cream, but refrigerated or at room temp, it's more like cream cheese. It's not my favorite for smoothies because it's so thick I have to stir it together first, and it also has added guar gum. For smoothies I like to make my own coconut milk using organic unsweetened dried coconut and hot water. If you google it, you will find tons of blogs and youtube videos that show how. It's very easy and makes great coconut liquid coconut milk. Its hard to control the amount of cream that you get though, so for recipes, I still prefer the canned.This is good quality and tastes great and will make consistent recipes every time.

"I've been using this stylus to annotate PDF's on my iPad (using the GoodNotes app). So far, it's worked out better than the traditional soft-tipped styluses I have tried. The accuracy when highlighting is greater and my handwriting is, while not perfect, at least more natural and easier to control than with other styluses. I wouldn't want to use this to write or sketch for long periods of time, but for quick notes and highlighting it works great. I like how the cap on this, which is necessary to protect that clear disc over the tip, screws onto the end of the pen so you don't lose it. The clip has worked well to clip it to either my pants pocket or my iPad case.Overall, I think this is a nice stylus for writing and annotating. The clear disc is mildly cumbersome, although I can see that it's probably necessary to prevent the fine tip from scratching the screen. I don't let my kids use this one because there is no cushion on it and I don't trust them not to push or tap too hard and possibly damage the screen, but for myself it's great. If your main purpose in needing a stylus is to click on things that you have a hard time reaching with your finger, you may be able to get away with using a cheaper stylus, but for writing, you definitely want a fine tip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NHXN2R3G6RKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","R3NHXN2R3G6RKE","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Court of Thrones and Roses is a new-adult fantasy revolving around the fae. It is a bit of a hybrid retelling of ""East of the Sun and West of the Moon"" with a little ""Beauty and the Beast"" thrown in. I was pleasantly surprised to find that while the framework from those stories is evident in the general plot, the details are unique and I wasn't always able to guess what would happen next. Maas does a good job of taking these stories and making them her own, which was nice to see because retellings can become tedious when they are too predictable. I suspect any fans of her other books will be thrilled with this new world and nothing I say will deter them, nor would I want to.However, aside from liking the plot, I was not blown away by this book. I've read Sarah Maas before (Throne of Glass) and thought that book was just ok. I was still excited to get my hands on this one and give it a try because of the early praise I was seeing on Goodreads; unfortunately, and this is only my opinion, I found the writing to be weak and lackluster, and that is the main reason why I'm only giving it three stars.In my experience, the difference between YA and NA is slim, but NA books typically have older protagonists in more mature situations and usually have more explicit sexual content than the YA ""fade to black"" variety. In that sense, because it has some PG-13 sex in it, Court of T&R is technically a new adult book-- yet it still felt like a YA book to me. It contained all of the typical YA tropes that just won't die: first-person narrator, insignificant young girl who accomplishes unimaginable feats, negative internal woe-is-me self talk, and more than one gorgeous man vying for her attention. If those things bug you, be advised before heading into this one.Surprisingly, I'm actually not holding the trope pitfalls against this book, though. Like I said before, I really did get caught up in the plot and it kept me turning pages quickly until I was done. My biggest complaint with this book was the writing itself. I don't expect high literature when I pick up books like this, I pick them up for a fun afternoon escape, but I still expect some degree of finesse from best-selling authors. I want descriptions that help me see things, rather than generalities such as ""…So much color, so much sunlight and movement and texture… I could hardly drink it in fast enough. To paint it would be useless, would never do it justice.""That told me absolutely nothing about why this land of the Fae was so breathtaking. Not all descriptions were like that, there were a few good moments, but most of the time I was unimpressed with the descriptions and the word choices. Repeated turns of phrase, such as ""a chill spider-walked down my spine,"" become distracting when they are used multiple times, and I was considerably bothered by the incessant use of the ""as if"" similes. I'm not usually one to let minor writing quirks annoy me, but I felt that this book was dragged down by a classic, and severe, case of ""telling, not showing."" Any time the author didn't trust me as the reader to be smart enough to figure out what the characters' body language was saying, she just had the narrator explain it in painful detail. I found this insulting to my intelligence.But, those are my only real complaints.Basically, this is a beach read. An airplane read. An ""I'm sick and need a distraction,"" read. It's not particularly well-written and the tropes might annoy the more jaded readers of the YA genre, but if you know you already like Sarah Maas's style and the plot synopsis intrigues you, give it a try. You may enjoy it more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RES823UB2P1Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619634449#wasThisHelpful","RES823UB2P1Q4","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this product, what you see is what you get: five opaque white (not translucent) dividers with large curved tabs that are spaced to span the length of an 8.5x11"" sheet of paper. They will not overhang your papers and compete with larger pocket dividers, but they are good for making subcategories within a larger section of a binder. I tested the ""write and erase"" claim by making three small stars on one divider using a pencil, a sharpie, and a ball-point pen. After about two weeks I tried erasing them and found the pencil erased completely, the ball-point pen also erased but was faintly visible, and the sharpie was (expectedly) not erasable. Conveniently, I think a good thick pencil lead actually writes cleaner on these and is easier to read than a pen anyway, so that is what I recommend using.The only reason I knocked off a star was because the description says they are translucent, and that is not really accurate. You will not be able to see through them, but they are clean and crisp and functional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CXEVKUO9KH9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O48FQAI#wasThisHelpful","R3CXEVKUO9KH9G","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This projector has, in all ways, exceeded our expectations. Even before getting a white screen to project it on, and using a wall painted a gray green color, the colors were breathtaking. Vibrant color, deep blacks, and adjustable screen size up to 300""… this is as close to having a movie theater in your home as you can get.I was nervous, as always, when receiving electronics through the mail, but the packaging was excellent and the product arrived in mint condition. For this price tag, I honestly expected quite the ordeal with setting it up, but by (temporarily) using a high bookshelf to set it on and a usb cord to connect the DVD player to the projector, everything was up and running and we were watching a movie in about five minutes. I couldn't believe it. So for ease of use, it doesn't get simpler. We haven't mounted it to the ceiling and hardwired it in yet, but I don't anticipate problems with it.We have it back about 16 feet from the wall and if we wanted to, it would fill the entire wall with no problem. Adjusting the size of the screen is as simple as turning a dial, and we keep it at about a 60"" screen.We have used it with our Xbox 360 to let the kids play 4-player Minecraft and it worked without a hitch. We noticed no lagtime and they were thrilled to play on a screen that big.I would note that this is the first time I have ever been able to tell a difference between our standard DVD's and blue-ray DVD's. There was a marked difference in the color and picture quality when using a blue-ray disc. That's actually kind of exciting because it's annoyed me for years to pay extra for blue-ray and not even be able to tell a difference. If there was no improvement from a normal DVD to a blue-ray it would mean the projector had maxed out its capabilities at a lower resolution, but a blue-ray allowed me to fully experience the awesomeness that is 1080p for the first time. The first movie we tried on it was Avatar (the one with the giant blue guys, not the humorless air benders) and we were stunned. We could not believe how breathtaking the picture quality was.This is obviously not going to work as well in a room with lots of windows. It needs to be a darker room where you can control the light levels. We used it in a room with a  couple of windows that have wooden blinds, and as long as the blinds are closed we have no problems even during the day.Basically, I think this thing is flat out amazing and I have no problem giving it all five stars. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CDXFNN7TMDNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5HZYKI#wasThisHelpful","R1CDXFNN7TMDNF","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These file folders are decent quality for the price. About the thickness of cardstock, they are not heavy duty, but will work fine for holding a reasonable amount of papers within a larger hanging-filing system. I like that they come stacked separately by style (left tab, middle tab, right tab) so you can pick and choose the style you need without reorganizing a huge stack of file folders. They are packaged economically, meaning shrink wrapped all together in a plain brown box. Mine were slightly bent from the pressure of the shrink wrap, but after unwrapping them and letting them sit on the shelf for a while, they seemed to relax and there isn't a visible bend or crease on them now. I did see a box of 100 file folders at my local Costco for a better price, but if you don't have access to Costco, this is a good deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGTGNW68B6EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P81WFWM#wasThisHelpful","R3KGTGNW68B6EC","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several leather couches and leather seats in my car, and as much as I love them, they are a pain to condition. I was excited to try out these leather care pads because they claim to ""clean and condition"" all in one step. In the tub you get 12 thick felt pads that are pre-soaked with the cleaning/conditioning solution. The pads themselves are nice and sturdy and work well for the task, although they dry out fairly quickly so you would need at least two to do a standard sized couch. I found them to clean fairly well, if the pad turning dark and dingy is any indication, and they did get out a few spots where my kids had colored on the couch with markers. As far as the conditioning aspect though, I was underwhelmed. A week afterward my couch seemed just as dry and in need of conditioning as it did before. In the past I have always used Leather Honey Leather Honey Leather Conditioner which works great but is time consuming to apply because you need to first clean the couches with a leather cleaner, let the honey sit overnight, and then wipe off any excess. After using these pads to try and take a short cut I've decided the leather honey is still worth the effort, BUT I do like these Lexol pads for the cleaning step and they also did a good job of applying the Leather Honey. I just turned it over and used the other side of the pad to apply it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X211TEHP7MBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTXPCA0#wasThisHelpful","R2X211TEHP7MBR","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So here's the deal. I really like the idea of these bins, the design, and the potential they have to keep my lazy susan organized. I used to keep my vinegar bottles in an upper cabinet but this container has allowed me to keep them in the lazy susan without them tipping over every time it spins. Even though I like the bin, this is why I gave it three stars: This particular one is a much smaller wedge and you would need EIGHT of them to fill up a lazy susan. Eight would cost a fortune. This particular size, in my opinion, is best suited to taller bottles such as vinegar and oil bottles. The narrow end is much too small to hold a can of beans etc so this size is only good for certain things. InterDesign does make a bigger size wedge, the quarter wedge, and that to me would be much more practical. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't seem to sell that particular one but I found it at Bed, Bath and Beyond. To me that size seems the most useful. It seems more expensive at $16.99, but it is equivalent to two of these 1/8th bins, so they actually end up costing less. You could even mix and match to maximize your storage potential. I will be picking up more of them, just wish the quarter wedge style was available on Amazon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYIPDFMAMBIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTSEHZS#wasThisHelpful","R3DYIPDFMAMBIJ","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as pocket dividers go, these ones are quickly becoming my favorites. I love the fun, bright, cheerful colors, but please be aware that these are distinctly feminine in design and may not be for everyone. As another reviewer mentioned, the tabs do indeed overhang the edge of the binder, even when it's closed. Not by a lot, but just a smidge. At first I was worried this would be be annoying and inconvenient and prevent me from storing it on the bookshelf. As time has gone on, however, this design has grown on me more and more for the following reasons:1. Even if I have some papers in page protectors, the dividers are still big enough to overhang them so my papers aren't competing with my labels and it's easy for me to see where everything is at.2. I can get to different sections quickly and easily because, again, the divider labels are bigger and the divider itself is larger than any papers I have in there.3. My binder looks clean, cheerful, and organized.4. The plastic is thick enough to allow me to flip the whole section without fear of ripping it.5. The pockets are not exceptionally deep and they won't hold more than about 8 sheets of paper, but they are strong and the restrictions on size prevents me from stuffing everything in there and leaving it forever.All in all, these are great dividers. The reason I took off a star is because I wasted almost an hour on the Avery website trying to print my label names using their interface. I thought I had it all exactly how I wanted it, it looked great on screen, but then I went to print it and they were off by a few millimeters, which ruined the whole sheet. Since you only get one, that was annoying. I wound up using my label maker to just label them myself and it worked great. Wish I wouldn't have wasted time trying to use the printer at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5C0BXW6WK8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIAN7J4#wasThisHelpful","R1L5C0BXW6WK8H","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received two packs of these pens, one in the primary colors and one in the vivid. I love the vivid assorted pack! Dark purple, teal, coral pink, orange, and lime green. What you see on the cap is what you get on the white board. The colors are very true.What I like most about these pens is that the color is vibrant and very true to the color of the cap, you definitely know when you're getting low on ink because you can see it in the chamber on the side, and they are easy to write with. They do erase cleanly, BUT not with your finger. If you make a mistake and try to correct it by wiping the ink away with your finger, you will get a big smeary mess. That is why I always use a 3M dry eraser (the white and blue ones) and they erase phenomenally. As long as you use an eraser you will have no problems keeping your board nice and clean.Another thing I'd like to note, even though the package says ""fine point"" these are not super fine, like a writing pen. If you're writing on a white board, this will easily allow you to write small enough to fit a ton on the board, but if you're trying to write on something smaller (say, a laminated worksheet) you would most likely want a finer tipped pen (i.e. Expo brand fine tip).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWHE520JE68G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJ2EJMQ#wasThisHelpful","RCWHE520JE68G","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the concept of this little device and overall it works very well. I've had no problems using it with my iPhone 5 and charging from a wall unit as well as my Macbook. The white part is flexible so when you plug it into your phone it kind of bends and just dangles there while it charges. I took off one star because this only works if you have a USB adapter to plug it into (I don't have one in my car so I would have to have one with me or find one somewhere I guess for it to be practical) and I took off another star because the little metal ring that actually clips to the device is SUPER flimsy, which worries me. The key ring itself isn't flimsy, but the one holding the device to the key ring is poor quality. I would recommend keeping this in a designated spot in your purse rather than clipping to a key chain so it doesn't break off and get lost.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POHEOMFI5E2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9BRQYK#wasThisHelpful","R1POHEOMFI5E2H","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be honest, I'm a little surprised at how many low star reviews this fan has as I'm hard pressed to find any flaws with it. It's got a lovely finish that really will go with just about any decor and it looks very classy. As noted in the description, it weighs about 7.8 pounds, but feels very heavy-- much heavier than any plastic fans I've ever had. I have no worries that it will stay exactly where I put it, but if I was to put it in a child's room I would definitely want to hide the cord behind a dresser. This thing is heavy and you don't want it falling on anyone. It is mid winter in Idaho so I haven't had a chance to give it a thorough work out yet, but I will say this, the times we have used the fan it has been whisper quiet. On low speed, I have to lean close to even hear the thing. On high speed it is not silent, but it's definitely quieter than any fan I've ever owned.

"After using this program intensely for a month, I now feel ready to give my honest feedback. Fair warning, this review will be long, so if you want to cut to the chase, here it is: while this program is stunningly pretty and appears to have lots of ""bells and whistles"" at first glance, in actual practice it fell far short of my expectations for a program with this price tag and I would NOT recommend it to people who want an all-inclusive reading program for their child. This could possibly serve as a supplement to other reading programs, but I see many flaws in how it is designed that I will explain in more detail below. Suffice to say that if you are wanting to actually teach your child how to read, there are many programs that are far superior and actually cost much less (e.g. Reading Eggs, All About Reading, Get Set for the Code series of workbooks etc) As nice as it would be to simply fork over the money for an expensive app and then hand the iPad to your child and let it teach them to read, there is no substitute for a little one on one time working with your child. You will have MUCH better results, a much less frustrated child, and you will save a ton of money.If you are wanting a program to supplement and help fill in the gaps for your child who's attending school, then I would recommend the Reading Eggs website. Well worth the money and I wish I had known about it when my kids were in school. If you have the time and desire to work with your child yourself, we've had great success using the Get Set for the Code books to learn letter sounds (wonderful gentle introduction to each letter and fun to do together) and then moving on to All About Reading (made by All About Learning Press).Now, moving on to the nitty gritty of my review.I'm a homeschooling mom of four kids, my youngest being 5 years old and in kindergarten. I used the program primarily with him, so my review will be on the effectiveness of this program with a pre-reader who is still learning letter names and their sounds.What you get for your ""purchase price"" is actually a one-year subscription to use this program either on a computer or as a fully functioning iPad app. After the first year is up you can continue using the program for either $99 per year OR $19.99 per month, whichever you prefer. I find this price to be outrageous. I have purchased reading programs for this price (All About Reading) and felt it was worth every penny and then some, and I also owned the program out right and was able to keep it forever or sell it when I was through. To pay $120 to rent this program for a year is ridiculous, especially when you consider that you can get the entire Hooked on Phonics app for $50 (incidentally, I don't recommend Hooked on Phonics for pre-readers, I'm just comparing the price on the two.)  I find the price to be WAY too high.I would only recommend using this program on an iPad. We tried it on the laptop one time and it was a huge fail due to the frequent need to ""drag and drop"" things. My 5-year-old does not have the computer literacy to maneuver the mouse well enough to do this, so it was very frustrating for him. Luckily the website is fully functional on an iPad and once you're logged in (through Safari) it looks and acts like any other app. The app itself is beautiful and the characters used to teach the lessons are adorable. They are colorful little water droplets named the ""Lingos"" and each has a name and a color and my son liked them immediately.Initial set up was not hard, but parental controls and customization were extremely limited. Unlike some programs, this one does not let you see what will be taught on each level. There is no ability to customize the program to turn on the things your child needs to work on and turn off the things they have mastered. So on some levels my child was bored because the ONLY way to unlock the game and get to the next level was to complete 10 rounds of 10 questions at each ""station"" and there were five or six stations on each level. That meant that on level 2, my son spent over two cumulative hours playing the iPad, and worked through 600 ""problems"" before he unlocked the game for that level. For that much work I expected the game to be amazing, but it was a simple little game that is similar to a dozen apps I have on my phone that I got for a dollar or less. The games are definitely not going to be an incentive to complete a level. Learning should be fun, but this felt incredibly repetitious and very much like ""drill to kill."" I was frustrated and irritated to not be able to look ahead and see what would be covered on each level and felt the parental controls were slim to none. If you think I'm exaggerating, an example of one of the things the packaging brags that you can customize is, wait for it... turning the background music on and off.I could look past the repetitious nature of the activities and even the lack of customization if this program was doing a good job of teaching phonics and reading skills, but I was very disappointed in this aspect of the program as well. When your child begins they have the option of choosing ""world 1"" or ""world 2"" based upon their skill level. World 1 is mostly preschool type activities (e.g. recognizing shapes and ""position"" words such as below, beside, above, between, etc.) World 2 jumps into more preschool/kindergarten activities and my son did enjoy the first couple levels on this world. But I noticed when he got to the third level that some of the activities were causing more confusion and frustration than anything.For example, in the ""Starting Sounds"" activity, the child is supposed to listen for a letter sound and then choose from three little pictures the one that starts with that sound. I've done this activity with him in our Get Set for the Code book and he loves this one and is very good at it. However, in this app, the computer voice says the sound of the letter, but there is no visual cue (such as the letter appearing that says that sound).  You only hear the sound, which can be hard to hear unless you are really dialed in and is very easy to miss. Then the computer voice goes slowly through each picture, naming them one at a time. This takes about ten seconds. After she has told you the name of each picture, the child is still supposed to remember the sound that they heard in the beginning and  be able to associate it with the picture. There is no button to press to have her repeat the sound if you need a reminder. If the child gets it wrong, the cute little Lingo character in the corner pouts and tosses the star he was going to award you on the ground. If the child gets it wrong two times, a chalkboard is wheeled out to ""help"" them. What I expected at this point was for a little lesson about the letter that they are being asked to identify, such as, ""This is the letter D. D says /d/, like dog (the picture that they are looking for)."" But what actually happens is the chalkboard has two pictures completely unrelated to the sound they are being quizzed on, and they are reminded to listen really hard for the starting sound of the word, ""ssssssssock and sssssssssun."" Then the chalkboard goes away and the child is still left starting at pictures that don't have anything to do with sock or sun, and expected to know which one starts with D. The same chalkboard will appear with the same ""lesson"" every time the child makes a mistake with absolutely no variation or relation to what they are actually learning.In the letter quiz activity, they child is presented with a lineup of seven letters. They are then told the name of the letter they are supposed to identify. My son has learned about 18 of the 26 letters so chances are good that he would do well with this and I was hoping it would help him learn the ones he doesn't have down yet. However, when he got it wrong, instead of a little chalkboard demo explaining more about the letter he didn't know, it just shows the entire alphabet and sings the alphabet song. Over and over and over again. He is supposed to get through 100 rounds of this torture before he can pass the level. Instead of helping him improve his letter literacy, which he's eager to do, he wound up guessing much of the time and then feeling discouraged and frustrated when he was not able to do what they were asking for.I find this program to be not only unhelpful to early readers, but could possibly be a deterrent. My initial review was going to be two stars, but the more I think about it the more I realize that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially at this exorbitant price. Invest in an actual reading program that you can do with your child, or if you really want something they can work on independently, try the two-week trial from Reading Eggs or ABCmouse.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYHD7IZ7W99B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2KAI2Y#wasThisHelpful","RVYHD7IZ7W99B","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an ancient copy of Toast that I used for years when I needed to burn a disc, but never really tapped into any other capabilities it may have possessed. After upgrading to Toast 12 I've been pleasantly surprised. It's very stable and works well on my Macbook running Mountain Lion. I had hoped it would allow me to import DVD's (specifically my exercise DVD's) so that I could watch them on my iPad, but so far every DVD I've tried that's not a specific ""digital copy"" disc has been copywritten and Toast refused to do anything with it. So, I'm still using the downloadable internet program Handbrake for that, which works very well and it's free.What I have been thrilled with so far about this program is it's ability to tackle audiobooks. It has a specific audiobook import option that allows you to check out audiobooks on CD from the library and convert them into one long continuous track. I love audiobooks but they are crazy expensive, even with an Audible membership, and CD's can just be a huge hassle. I don't want to listen only when I'm driving, I want the book on my phone so I can listen through ear buds whenever I want. Toast has allowed me to do that without jumping through the hoops I used to go through (e.g. import each CD individually and try not to get them all tangled in a big jumbled mess as you create a playlist). It takes a little while to feed each CD in and wait for it to be converted (approximately an hour to do an entire audiobook) but you can definitely walk away while it does it's thing. Considering how expensive audiobooks can be, being able to utilize my library's vast collection is a definite plus for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4I9ULFLA0HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L64Q6SE#wasThisHelpful","R2L4I9ULFLA0HT","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to agree with another four-star reviewer who gave this binder five stars for durability and three stars for the feel of it. When you pick up this binder, it doesn't seem like anything special and it has a strange rubbery texture that I don't particularly enjoy touching. However, aesthetics aside, if you know you need a binder that can take a lot of abuse, you can't go wrong with this one. The hinge is incredibly strong. Because of the way it's designed it's difficult to click it open by accident, but when you do want it open it truly clicks open or closed with just one finger. The pockets on the front and back cover are flexible enough to hold a decent stack of papers; someone else said it was 200 but I would have to be pretty desperate to stuff that much in it. I have used those pockets to hold thicker magazines though and it had no problem with that at all.I also like that the front cover has that blue border so you can create a cover with a standard 8-1/2x11"" piece of paper and you won't have a bunch of dead space around it. It's makes for a more finished look. The price tag on this binder seems a little high at first, but if you're replacing your binders frequently because the cover is separating or the hinge is no longer holding, maybe spending the extra few bucks up front will save you money in the long run.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KOCG16NDUVAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB13XQ8#wasThisHelpful","R3KOCG16NDUVAD","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this apron! It's pretty and functional, with two deep pockets, an adjustable neck strap (simply pull on it to lengthen), and thicker fabric that reminds me more of duck cloth rather than 100% cotton. I haven't washed it yet so I don't know yet how the colors will stand up over time, but for now it's working well. I'm 5'6"" with a short waist and I have to fold it over a bit to get it to tie in the right spot on me, but I don't mind that. I knocked one star off because I don't like the feeling of something pulling on the back of my neck, even though loosening did help. In a perfect world, the apron would have two straps that go over my shoulders, but that's probably harder to make in a size that would fit most people. Oh well, can't have it all! All in all, this is a really pretty apron, the fabric is classy, and I would give it as a gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XO48FRYVRACY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IVJAE#wasThisHelpful","R2XO48FRYVRACY","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so I don't know if it's just me, or if there's something wrong with the particular router that I got, but I am so disappointed with this thing! I am not hardware savvy, but I can follow directions and I know how to set up and use a wireless router. This one was actually fairly easy to set up with very simplified and clear instructions, and I didn't have any trouble getting everything up and running. Or so I thought.My old router had left dead spots on the other side of the house. This router has no trouble getting a signal to the whole house (2800 sq ft, two story) but it is SO MUCH SLOWER than my old router. Even when I'm on the computer that is in the same room as the router, which is the only time I can use the 5 GHZ signal, it seems sluggish and takes a long time to boot up just simple you tube videos. I never had a problem streaming netflix to multiple devices in the past, but now if one person is using it, the other person's device is greatly affected.My husband has an app on his phone that tells you what the internet speed is and we were surprised to find it running at less than 1 MBPS; we had between 3 and 4 before. When we click the wifi off and go on cellular, it shoots back up to 4 mbps. Now, I guess it's possible that there's some magical setting that I need to tinker with, or change the IP address or whatever, but I really really hate having to jump through hoops to get things to work the way they are supposed to. I am homeschooling four kids and I don't have time to call support and walk through a list of troubleshooting tips... I think I will just plug in my old router and deal with the dead spot in the bathroom.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NMN61WDZYKXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8NCVX4#wasThisHelpful","R3NMN61WDZYKXD","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**update: My review was initially one star, but a comment from the developer helped me change the settings so we could move past level one. As a result, I'm upgrading my review to two stars, but I stand by everything else I said. This is definitely not the best Mavis Beacon product I've used.""Original Review:I've been playing with different versions of Mavis Beacon since second grade, and thanks in part to the great instruction and practice I received in my early years, I am a proficient typist. However, this particular version had nothing in common with the older versions I remember and I found it incredibly clunky and frustrating to use. I was hoping this program would help my 10 and 12-year-old sons to improve their keyboarding skills, but here are the problems we ran into:1. Installation went fine on our older 2007 iMac running Snow Leopard (no complaints there.)2. This program is PERSONAL edition, meaning progress for only one person will be saved. So unless you are a single person, you need the family edition.3. One of my sons hates video tutorials and would rather ""learn by doing,"" but this program requires you to watch every video all the way to the end (posture, finger positioning etc) before it will let you move on to the next part.4. Even if you watch all the videos to the end, it doesn't seem to ever let you progress. My other son watched every video, took the assessment test, and completed all three ""activities"" to learn the home row key, but it would never let him move on to step two. I even took the assessment test (scored 90+ wpm) and it wanted me to start at the very beginning, watch all the videos, and do the exact same steps of learning the keys, so I'm not sure why the assessment test is even included. It doesn't seem to make a difference in where you start.5. Like I said, we completed everything that seemed to be required to move on to step 2, but the program would not let us go forward. (UPDATE: I eventually was able to correct this by lowering the accuracy level needed to progress) Besides the lessons and skill assessments, there is just one section where you can ""free type,"" which you could do on any word processor. There are no games or activities that help you practice, just repetitious drills that include a very unnatural paragraph symbol at the end of each sentence. You are supposed to hit the enter key when you reach this symbol (like an old fashioned typewriter, I have no idea what the purpose of this is) and if you don't hit the enter key it counts as an error. I found this both annoying and pointless.6. There doesn't seem to be a clear path that you progress along to learn to type, and like I said before, it seemed to freeze up and refuse to let us move past step 1 (which was to learn the home row).Overall I found this program to be frustrating and unclear. It's not meant for kids (no games), but even an adult would have a difficult time making progress with this one. My recommendation would be to stick with an older version of Mavis Beacon or go with another program entirely. My kids are currently doing well with Typing Instructor Platinum for Kids.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6RU67FYVQ7E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZJRS8E#wasThisHelpful","R6RU67FYVQ7E8","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**UPDATE** My original review was four stars, but I'm coming back after a year of use to drop my rating. After one winter (on our covered porch, with the cover on) this fire pit is covered with rust, the bolts are loose, and overall it feels like it might fall apart at any moment. My husband says the metal is inferior quality and far too lightweight. I am not happy with how thing this has held up in the long term at all and for the price, you could probably get something nicer at Home Depot.**ORIGINAL REVIEW***We've wanted an outside fire pit for forever and have been very happy with this one. The instructions were relatively useless (no written directions, just a somewhat vague diagram) but all you need to do is attach the legs, everything else is done for you. My 9-year-old son put it together without the instructions and without my help. The black finish did scrape off fairly easily, though, and after assembly (and before ever having a fire) there were already several places that will need to be touched up with black fireplace paint at some point. Not a deal breaker, but if you are a perfectionist it might bug you.I love the design. It's large enough to accommodate several logs and the see-through design on the sides allows you to both see and feel the fire from all sides.Love the ridges on the bottom that allow for air flow under the logs and help it get going even faster. My only main complaints (aside from the paint chipping) is that the cover is either the wrong size or just chintzy, because we ripped it the very first time we tried to put it on. It also felt lighter weight than I would have expected from the picture. The lid is very lightweight and can be a little difficult to get positioned just right, which can be a pain when a fire is going. But overall I'm pleased with the function of this fire pit and I love the way it looks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDM8XC8EJP87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F41MYFE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDM8XC8EJP87","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The synopsis of The Venetian Bargain had me at hello. I love historical fiction, when it's done well, and I was really hoping this would sweep me away to another time and place and shed more light on what it was like during this period in history. Where I think this novel shines is in the research the author clearly did into the medical practices of the time. She brought it to life and whenever there was a medical procedure or a treatment being discussed, I was glued to the page. I loved seeing the superstitious nature of the Venetian doctors (wearing those hideous and frightening bird masks) and treating their patients by tying a dead frog around the neck or selling placebo oils at exorbitant prices. I also liked the main character of Feyra and found her journey as a stowaway aboard a plague ship from Constantinople fairly riveting.Yet this book still fell a little flat for me. I thought the plague plot itself could have stood on its own, but things became muddled with too much backstory, too much unbelievable intrigue, and it didn't flow well enough for me. I was over halfway through the book before I felt like I was starting to see where it was going, and I was never so interested that I couldn't put it down and walk away to do other things.This is a nice book. A decent book. But is it epic or remarkable? I don't really think so. And just for frame of reference, when I compare it to books that WERE epic and remarkable, I'm thinking of The Pillars of the Earth, which is both a heartwrenching love story as well as an amazing look at what really goes into the building of a cathedral. I'm also thinking of Forever Amber (Rediscovered Classics), which is set during the Black Plague as well and did an AMAZING job of showing how truly horrific the plague was. When compared with those two books, The Venetian Bargain seems watered down and pale in comparison.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3LK2VQ8VGCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FILHB2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3T3LK2VQ8VGCJ","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so in love with this tea pot. I got the red color and wanted to note that in the amazon picture (at least on my computer) it seems like it will be a bright, almost hot pink, shade of red, but in reality it's GORGEOUS. It is candy apple red, bright without being obnoxious, and offers a lovely pop of color in my gray-blue kitchen.As far as tea brewing, I couldn't be happier. It's beautifully designed: specifically, the pour spout never drips after pouring, is wide enough to facilitate easy cleaning, and I have no trouble getting every last drop of tea out of the pot. The stainless steel filter basket clips into place and reaches all the way to the bottom of the pot, so whether you are brewing one cup or four, you will have no trouble covering the leaves with water. I also love that the filter is incredibly fine-- there will be no loose tea floating in your tea, even if your leaves are very small.I'm still tinkering to find the perfect ratio of tea to water, but I've been pretty successful with 1 tsp of tea leaves for 6 oz of water. I poured some pre-measured water in before brewing tea the first time to see where the waterline would be for two cups vs three cups, and that has allowed me to make a pretty consistent pot of tea.All in all, I'm super happy with this tea pot. It's pretty enough to sit on my kitchen windowsill as decor when I'm not using it, and I would buy it as a gift for any tea drinker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8Y4PU46F09A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9T1RTA#wasThisHelpful","R1H8Y4PU46F09A","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're reading reviews for Landline, you're either killing time till the book is released or you've never read a Rainbow Rowell book. How do I know? Because once you've read a Rainbow Rowell book you stop looking at the synopses and reviews (which never do much for me anyway) and just click the ""buy it now"" button. She has some sort of magic that makes her characters come to life and she writes dialogue that is so authentic and entertaining you don't want them to stop talking. I *love* the way that Rainbow writes, and I don't think that my opinion on this book one way or the other will talk a true Rowell fan out of reading it.With that being said, however, I will tell you that this is my least favorite book I've read from this author. Fangirl is still far and away my favorite, followed by Attachments, and then Landline (still have to read Eleanor & Park, but I'm saving it for when I need a guaranteed good book). If you're new to Rowell's work, start with Fangirl. If you're all caught up on her stuff, then yes, definitely give this one a go because I think it will resonate on different frequencies for each person that reads it depending upon their frame of reference.The synopsis pretty neatly encapsulates what this book is about so I'm not going to rehash it, but here's what worked for me: she made me fall in love with and root for a couple that I was introduced to fourteen years into their marriage. That is actually hard to do, because honestly, old married couples can be boring. I most enjoy reading about the journey of falling in love, so my expectations were low for the romance in this book, but I never should have doubted Rainbow Rowell's ability to draw me in. She did an amazing job of weaving together past and present so that I DID get to see Georgie and Neal's relationship from the beginning, how they fell in love, the struggles they had gone through, and by the end I was absolutely rooting for them to stay together. I saw in some other reviews that people felt the ending was left too ""open,"" but I didn't find that to be true for me. I liked how it ended and felt satisfied with where it went.But since I only gave it three stars, obviously there were things that brought down my rating as well. I don't mind magical realism in stories, but the ""magic phone"" in this book felt a little clunky in how it was handled. It was an interesting way to remind Georgie about her love for her husband and the beginnings of their relationship, but in the end I can't help wondering if the author could have accomplished this without the magic phone and maybe avoided some of the loose threads it left in my mind. The plot itself was a little slow and I found it easy to put down and walk away from for a few days, but I also had no trouble slipping back into the story when I picked it back up.Overall, I liked the book. I didn't love it, but here's the funny thing about Rainbow Rowell: I've read three of her books, and only one has gotten over three stars from me. Yet I still have her listed as one of my most favorite authors. I can only attribute this to the fact that even when I don't really care for the plot of her books, her writing is always peppered with moments of brilliance and characters that shine so brightly they blind me to any flaws. I will continue to read whatever she puts out next, and I think you should too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38O0747Y3WEWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049377#wasThisHelpful","R38O0747Y3WEWS","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago when I was eyeball deep in the exhausting and challenging season of mothering four young children/babies, I discovered Lisa Jo's blog The Gypsy Mama. I connected with her words in such a visceral way. She had me crying over my computer as she voiced everything I was feeling, yet she also offered so much hope and encouragement. So when her book was offered to me for review, I jumped at the chance.Surprised by Motherhood is a beautifully written and poignantly reflective mixture of memoirs from Lisa-Jo's childhood, early marriage, and journey into motherhood. She is transparent and real about the struggles she has had, and she writes authentic vignettes that illustrate the ways God has shown Himself faithful to her in the many different seasons of her life. This book is less about her becoming the perfect mom, and more about her gradually seeing and understanding God's heart through motherhood.""I discovered at the heart of my misery was a misunderstanding about faith. I had confused faith in God with faith in what God could do for me. He led me out of my heartache and into a season of redemption and beauty. All without changing His answer. Instead, He changed me.""I think that this book will resonate differently for everyone, especially depending upon your expectations. If you're looking for a ""how to"" guide or yet another parenting book that will give you specific strategies, that's not what this book is about. This is, plain and simply, Lisa-Jo's story. It's her testimony. There were parts that brought me to tears and really touched my heart. I loved hearing about her time serving as an advocate for victims of human trafficking in Ukraine. I loved hearing about her father's heart for adoption and seeing the gospel revealed in the way her family has ministered to orphans in South Africa. I loved the story of how God reached down and spoke directly to the deepest fears and hurts in her heart and assured her that He would love her even if she never became a mother.But there were also parts that didn't do much for me and I struggled to find the motivation to keep reading. I had little interest in reading about the births of all three of her children in such detail and I would have liked to see a cohesive theme tied throughout the book. However, my three stars are not meant as a negative rating. That's just what this was for me: a three-star read. However, just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it won't be for someone else. It's very hard to say where you will fall on the spectrum. If you enjoy testimonies and/or if you are already a fan of Lisa-Jo's blog, then there is a very good chance this book will strike a chord for you. But I would not necessarily give this as a gift to another mother since it doesn't have a lot of practical application.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14V5ONNSX9GHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414387857#wasThisHelpful","R14V5ONNSX9GHA","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting concept from Five Star: the flexibility of a spiral notebook with the customizable features of a binder. I really liked the idea of being able to add paper and move things around while still being able to fold the thing back on itself for ease of writing, but in actual practice I didn't find it was especially functional for me.PROS:* comes pre-filled with both lined and graph paper* the rings are plastic, not metal, so even though they still get in my way (I'm a lefty) they have enough give to them that I can write more easily than a standard binder. I am unable to write directly in a standard 3-ring binder, but I was able to do so in this one. I still prefer a spiral notebook though because the spirals are so much smaller against my wrist.* The dividers are high quality and very functional with a variety of different pockets and slots to hold everything from loose papers to CDs.* There is a pocket on the front and the back so you can slide in a custom cover for your notebook or even use it to hold magazines or other pamphlets. It's a good-sized pocket.CONS:* The plastic rings (which were also on my list of pros) have a downside: they must be manually clicked open one at a time if you want to move things around, and I don't know how sturdy and reliable they will be over time. They are just plastic afterall, and it would truly suck to get this thing filled to the brim and have those rings burst open. It's neither quick nor convenient to rearrange things, so if you anticipate doing a lot of that I would go with a standard 3-ring binder.* the soft canvas ""spine"" is a little floppy and unattractive when the binder is underfilled. This probably won't be a big deal for most people, but if it was on a bookshelf it wouldn't look that great.Basically, I think this is a great option for people who like spiral notebooks but want the flexibility of being able to rearrange pages and/or add to the notebook when needed, as long as they aren't doing a lot of that.  But if you're happy using a binder, I don't see any reason to switch to this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LS4B0P2UGBMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OCW7YS#wasThisHelpful","R2LS4B0P2UGBMK","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love that this super soaker (which is the upteenth one we've tried) works well for all of my kids (ages 5-12). It's easy to load with water from the outside faucet because the green circle on top unscrews and has an ample hole for filling. It holds a good amount of water so it doesn't need to be refilled constantly. The crossbow action pops out with the press of a button and will then shoot three streams of water (less forcefully than when you have them folded in and the water is coming out the main part). There is no trigger. Simply pump the slider thing underneath, and as you pull it towards your body the water shoots out. This is awesome for my littlest guy because he can shoot the gun as well as his brothers can. Overall I think this is well-designed, sturdy, and easy to use.I asked my kids if there was any downside to it. The younger ones said no, they love it, but the oldest (age 12) complained that it sometimes leaks down his arm while he's shooting. I don't see that as a con because they are outside to get wet anyways, but if you just wanted to sit on your porch and shoot cats or something, it might bug you :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRNO1MUL7FD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAHY1QS#wasThisHelpful","R2HRNO1MUL7FD2","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this notebook as my ""brain dump"" location for the past week, and for the most part it's pretty great. I've been experimenting with the Bullet Journal system and that's what I'm using this notebook for. If you haven't heard of it, google it. It's just a method for note taking and to-do lists that really makes sense and the guy who invented it has a free website that explains everything.Anyways, let's just do a quick list of pros and cons for this notebook to keep things simple.PROS:1. Nice design that gives a little more structure than a normal notebook page, yet enough flexibility to change things up. Each page has a header section divided into five boxes, two of which are labeled ""page"" and ""date."" This works perfectly with the bullet journaling system because you always want to put the date at the top and number your pages so you can add them to the index later. This would also be helpful if you were keeping notes on a college class or had other reasons to keep track of notes on certain page numbers.2. The rest of the page is divided into two columns. The left column has a very small ""notes"" header and is blank (no lines) The right column is lined with numbers 1-28 down the side. The lines are approximately the same size as wide-ruled paper, which I saw some people didn't like, but I actually like that for to-do lists. It keeps things from getting too cluttered.3. Each page is perforated, so you can remove it, but they are not going anywhere unless you want them to. The spiral binding is solid and holds each page securely unless you really want to remove it.4. Each page has an identical layout, front and back, so you can do double-page spreads with no problem.5. I like the size of this notebook. The paper is about half an inch bigger than a standard sheet of lined paper, so more room to make notes.CONS:1.) I hate the ""Cambridge Limited"" logo on the bottom of every single page. This distracts me and feels intrusive on my thought process and it just makes my page look messy. I don't like it, not at all.2.) Having the numbered list go to 28 is fine for ""to do"" lists or creating a calendar for the month of February, but having it go to 30 or, ideally, 31 would make it much more flexible. I like to have a calendar page for each month and the numbered list isn't long enough to do that without handwriting the numbers in.3.) Paper is just normal paper, and not very heavy. My ultra-fine sharpie pen bleeds through like crazy. My regular ball-point pens are okay but still leave some indentations on the paper that show through the other side. Pencil would be no problem, though.FINAL THOUGHTS:This notebook has some really nice features and I will be happy to use it until it's filled. It's not perfectly suited to what I'm trying to do with the bullet journaling (planning to get a Moleskin graph paper one next time for that) but I can see this being an especially great fit for a college student who needs to take notes on classes. It's awesome for dumping your brain at the end of the day and at the time of writing this review it's on sale for around $5: I definitely would pay that for it. But $10 is pushing it, especially with that Cambridge Limited logo at the bottom of each page. The logo is really what cost this notebook major stars from me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSTM0O2Q1QG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AQONK#wasThisHelpful","RCSTM0O2Q1QG1","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:*This cover fits my iPad 2 perfectly.*It holds it very securely and I have no concerns about it falling out.* Love the little ridges that allow you to tilt the screen at about five different angles. Surprisingly, I use them all; whether I'm reading a recipe while cooking or watching a show on the bed, they all seem to have a purpose.* I like that it has a slot for a stylus and looks clean and professional when it's closed.Cons and stuff I wish it did that it doesn't do:* The picture on the executive case is a little misleading. The picture, to me, looks like a medium gray color with a very light almost white stripe on it. The actual product is more of a charcoal color with a slightly lighter stripe that is hardly noticeable. This is not a con, I like it better in real life than the picture, but I thought it was worth noting.* I do not like the suede material on the cover of this. I let my five-year-old play with my iPad and he had something grubby on his hands, and now the case has permanent marks. They did not wipe off and I'm not sure I will be able to get it to come clean. Much like a suede couch vs leather couch when you have kids, go with the other model that has a ""leather"" cover if you want to be able to wipe it clean.* It does not turn off the iPad when you close the cover. I thought that was a standard feature in most cases, so I was disappointed that this one doesn't do that.* I'm left-handed and the strap on the back that is supposed to help you hold the iPad isn't useful to me. It definitely seems more friendly to right-handed people, BUT I don't really care about that feature so it's not a deal breaker.* Since it's designed to fold back on itself and create a stand for horizontal viewing, sometimes when we just want to fold back the cover and use the iPad in hand, it gets all jumbled up and takes a little bit to remember how to fold it properly. It's a little like wrestling an accordion sometimes.All in all, this is a nice cover and I like it fine, but I can't rate it higher because I don't know how to clean it and it doesn't put the iPad to sleep.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KV4WHAW89I2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2CNSNY#wasThisHelpful","R2KV4WHAW89I2G","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried three varieties of these quartet pens (chisel point, bullet, and fine point) and there isn't a lot of difference between them.Pros: The ink is always bright and true-to-cap in color, long lasting yet easy to wipe off (with a white board eraser), and with the view-finder on the side so you know how much ink is left.Cons: The ink doesn't dry instantly (takes approx 3-4 seconds) so if you make a mistake and then try to wipe it off with your finger, it smears everywhere. Either wait a few seconds to let it dry before you wipe it off, OR use a white board eraser (this is the one I like 3M Whiteboard Eraser for Whiteboards, 2-Pack) The pens last us about a month with daily use. Not sure if that is a normal amount of time or if my kids just need to lay off the whiteboard masterpieces, but the pens do seem to run out of ink kind of fast.Comparison in Sizes:There is little to no difference between the tips on the fine-point and the bullet point. The difference is more in the size of the pen itself. The bullet point is fatter, and the fine point has a thinner body. But as far as how small you can actually write with them, there isn't much difference. I like the fine-point for my kids to use to practice their spelling words and such on a smaller white board because they are easier for them to hold. For myself, I like the chisel point best because I can use the tip to write small if needed, but I can use the flat side of the chisel to make a nice fat line if I need the writing to be seen from further away.All in all, I like these pens and will continue to use them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNNKMGKYKNVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FM65II#wasThisHelpful","R1NNNKMGKYKNVL","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very sensitive skin and shaving the bikini line, for me, is a no go. I have tried many different electric shavers in the past, including the MUCH more expensive pairing of Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver with a Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver. While that set up did work well, it cost much more and was most effective if I hadn't shaved in a while. It never got the skin as smooth when just touching up.I was pleasantly surprised with this Remington grooming kit. It has many different attachments to meet all your grooming needs, whether you are doing your bikini line or entire bikini area (yes, it can handle it), peach fuzz on your cheeks, stray hairs above the eyebrows etc. It even includes a buffer attachment, which in theory helps remove dry skin and prevent ingrown hairs. I have yet to remember to use that attachment but I like that it was included. I have not used this to do my arms but my personal opinion is that the head is rather small and while I think it *could* handle it, it might take a long time. It's not recommended for legs.All in all, I think this is a great little tool, especially for the price. It trimmed my bikini hair, and then shaved it smooth, so I was left with the desired result without any rashing or ingrown hairs. I would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B7JTYZXDAP1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB5YI0G#wasThisHelpful","R1B7JTYZXDAP1G","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pros on this grater:1. Sturdy square shape with straight sides is ideal for grating cheese.2. Well-made and easy to clean. The rubber gasket around the bottom of the grater can be removed for cleaning if food gets down  in there.3. Love the measuring cup that attaches to the bottom. Makes measuring cheese, especially finer cheese like parmesan, easy and has a snap on lid for easy storage of leftovers.4. The straight sides allow it to lie neatly inside of a standard 6"" drawer, which saves me cupboard space.5. Does a great job with cheese and carrots, which is what I mostly use it for.Now for the CONS:1. The slicer on the side, which is supposedly for things like cucumber and zucchini, turned my cucumber into thin watery shreds. I tried it once and won't be using it for that again, which leaves that side of the grater obsolete. A mandolin or a good old fashioned knife are far superior for slicing.2. Honestly not really sure what the smaller-holed sides are good for. I did grate some nutmeg and some ginger on the smaller side, and while it got the job done I felt a lot of it was wasted on the inside of the grater. I still prefer a microplane grater for these tasks.If you're looking for a nice functional box grater, this will definitely get the job done and my favorite features is that it fits in a drawer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB0NBYYV1C7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007VO0CQ#wasThisHelpful","RB0NBYYV1C7B","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I chose this book, the synopsis promised me:""A captivating and magical adult retelling of the fairy tale East of the Sun, West of the Moon.""What I got was:""A magical middle-grade retelling of the fairy tale East of the Sun, West of the Moon with an awkward mention of an erect penis.""And that is my biggest complaint with the book.Other than that one incongruent sexual reference, the love scenes were very vague and mostly ""fade to black."" I didn't go into this expecting an erotica or anything, but if you're going to market it to adults and throw in words like that, then don't prude out on me. It felt like the author really wanted to be writing a middle-grade/YA fantasy book, and she could have pulled that off beautifully with the framework she built, but instead she tried to ride the NA wave and draw in an older audience by attempting to sexualize her story.Unfortunately, I didn't feel like she was comfortable writing it and I was bored reading it. It just didn't fit with the story. Since this was supposed to be a NA book, I had higher expectations for world-building and wanted a deeper romance.Honestly, this really was just the original fairytale with some padded action scenes and dialogue. She followed the fairy tale almost exactly (I looked it up on Wikipedia to make sure). That would be fine, except I don't personally care for fairytale retellings unless they take the original and put a spin on it so that the story is new. This was just like reading a Hans Christian Anderson story, only a little longer and with a unexpected penis reference. Are you uncomfortable seeing Hans Christian Anderson and penis in the same sentence? Me too. Those two things just don't belong together, which is why I was put off by it.The NA ""content"" (which honestly doesn't add to the story and was pretty sparse) could be eliminated and this would instantly become a great middle-grade fantasy book. This is a story I would have loved as a 13-year-old girl. But since it's there I can't recommend it for younger readers either, and it felt too juvenile for me to enjoy as an adult.If you are an adult who likes middle-grade books and fairytale retellings, you may enjoy this story, but since that wasn't what I was looking for, it left me disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZO76ZIYUE9H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF5XUX2#wasThisHelpful","RZO76ZIYUE9H1","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Update after a couple months**My 9-year-old son still adores this book and still spends time looking at it several times a week. When I asked him what he thought of it, he said, ""I think this is the most interesting book I've ever read. I just love it.""**Original Review***Do you have kids? Do you have a coffee table? Do you have a bathroom?If the answer to any of those is yes, then you need this book.As soon as they saw the little blurb on the cover stating ""not for parents"" my 9-and-11-year-old sons were hooked. They love nonfiction books, especially ones with lots of pictures and fascinating facts. This one absolutely did not disappoint. They poured over it and learned about many zany and amazing places that exist in this crazy world that we had never heard of. It covers everything from the Cirque Du Soleil (with great pictures) to a baby-jumping festival in Spain (yes, they really run and leap rows of live babies like Evel Kneivel...who does that?!) to the creepy catacombs of Italy, to the largest computerized parking lot in the world. There is zero wasted space on the page. Every inch is filled with colorful photos and fascinating stories.I would like to note that one of the sections in the book is entitled ""Fright Night"" and includes stories, and pictures, about mummies, ghosts and supposedly haunted places in the world. The accompanying stories that are told about the ghosts (e.g. the ghost of Anne Boleyn haunting the London Tower and the story of Lizzie Borden) are not too graphic but might be frightening to some children. My kids find the scary stuff the most intriguing, but I want to mention it in case that is a turn off for some people.The content in this book really is diverse. Here's a list of the chapter titles:1.Stupendous Structures2. The Good Life3. Thrills, Spills and Games4. Cultural Wonders5. Hidden Places6. High Tech7. Fright Night8. Dangerous PlacesThis is a book that anyone would enjoy picking up and thumbing through. Get it for your coffee table, get it for your waiting room, get it for the kids in your life who are curious about the world but don't necessarily like to read (as well as for those kids who DO like to read).

"Over the years, we've had our fair share of Monopoly sets. The compact version. The ""modern"" cartoony version. The thrift-store-half-the-houses-are-missing version.This set is just the best. It's everything I remember from my childhood, all the tokens and the money and the properties look the same, but with some sweet little upgrades that made play faster and easier. I am in love with the banker tray. It keeps the money beautifully organized and easy to use, as well as giving you a place to hold the houses and extra tokens, but it isn't a pain to put away at the end of the game. You just stick it back in the box and you're done. You could use it to hold the properties as well, but we don't because you can't easily see which properties have been sold if they are stacked together. I've included a picture up above so you can see what the tray looks like.I'm keeping this short and sweet… if you like Monopoly, this is the classic game at its finest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZJDKOSDT6HN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JSM3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R38ZJDKOSDT6HN","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third time I've purchased a set of these little cars. Once for our nursery/toddler room at church, once as a gift for my nephew, and now this last set to keep on hand for an emergency baby shower gift.Some of the features I appreciate most:*The cars are soft to the touch, which is great because babies can crawl along and push them but if they fall over they won't bonk a lip.*The soft part detaches from the wheel base so it can be washed, which is ideal when you have a lot of kids playing with something. That portion can be thrown in the washing machine and then air dryed.* They appeal to babies, but also toddler/2-year-olds. The older kids only had to be shown a couple times how to pull them back and let them go and they were off, chasing them around the room.*The cars actually go pretty quick and fairly far.I don't have anything negative to say about these cars. While a little pricey, I think you get what you pay for and these are of good quality. They are an ideal gift for a one-year-old's birthday party or baby's first Christmas, and I really love giving them because I know they will be enjoyed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100M82PWC7CG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EX5K1GG#wasThisHelpful","R100M82PWC7CG8","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Twenty-one-year old Shandi is on her way to start a new life. She's loaded up her tiny VW bug with all her possessions, her briliant three-year-old son, and her best friend Walcott and they are headed to the big city where she will have the opportunity to attend college. Natty (short for Nathan) gets car sick on the way, so they pull over to clean up at a gas station, where Shandi and Natty promptly become victims of an armed robbery.William-- tall, blonde, handsome William-- is also shopping in the Circle K and also finds himself facedown on the cold linoleum while a kid with a gun screams and hollers and demands money nobody has. Though the robbery is short in duration, it leaves lasting marks on all involved and draws them all together, for better or worse.This is such a hard book to review, mostly because I can't put  my finger on whether I enjoyed it or not. The description lures you into expecting a love story, and it's so perfectly named because it IS a love story... just, someone else's love story. You will not know until the very end whose love story you are reading, who you are supposed to root for, who will end up with whom. That is actually what I loved most about this book. The fact that it kept me on my toes and I had no idea where it was going or what it was really about.William is a complicated hero, and I won't spoil it by telling you what exactly that means because you should find out for yourself, but he was definitely different from any hero I have read up till now. There was no instalove. There were no cheesy confessions of unrealistic adoration within moments of meeting eachother. There was just the story of what happened to William and Shandi after the robbery, and then flashbacks to what came before, helping us to piece together the bigger picture and eventually discover exactly what story we are reading. Also, there were some really sweet moments between William and Natty... and Shandi and William... and Shandi and Walcott... and William and his best friend Paula... and flashbacks to William chasing after and falling for his first love Bridgett... did I mention that this is someone else's love story?So if I liked it, why just the three stars? Well, quite simply, this book was somewhat forgettable. I enjoyed it while reading it and had no trouble slipping into the story and wanting to know what happened next, but I never fully connected with the characters and once I was finished, I haven't really thought about it again. I save my four and five star ratings for books that I liked enough to recommend to friends and/or re-read myself, so I can't rate this one higher; but, if you're already a fan of Joshilyn Jackson, or just looking for a great read that doesn't necessarily fall into any clear genre brackets and will keep you guessing till the end, then yes, give this one a try.

"A few things to note about this hair dryer:TEMPERATURE: It has a total of four settings:  1. Quick blast cold button (takes about 2-3 seconds to get cold when you push the button)  2. Cold temperature setting (so the air blows cold without having to push the button)  3. Medium/warm (this is the setting I always use and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair very quickly)  4. Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it's way too hot for me)**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you're using, even if it's the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.WEIGHT: It does feel a little heavier than I'm used to. I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top so my arm doesn't really get tired. It weighs approximately 1-lb-11-oz , which isn't all that much but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more. This is the only reason I took off a star.CORD: Long enough to allow me to easily dry my hair and move the dryer all over the place without running out of cord, but it doesn't get tangled or gnarly. It wraps up quick and clean.SPEEDS: It has two speed settings, high and low. I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.I couldn't really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don't have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I'm done, even when I don't use a brush to blow it out. I recently went on a trip and left my dryer at home, which meant I used the tiny little hair dryer in the hotel. After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer. I am a mom of 4 and I don't have extra time to waste drying my hair, so the faster it can get done the better. This one definitely gets the job done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRGDTFUCQSZUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB8ZIW0#wasThisHelpful","RRGDTFUCQSZUC","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be honest, I've been giving this Schleich brand of figurines the stink eye for years. We come across them at Target, and the specialty toy shops, and the little booths in the mall, and my kids always flock to them like moths to flame. And I always pick them up and check the price and give a little gasp and remember that these are the expensive ones and who in their right mind would pay that much for a little figurine?Then I was offered one of these griffin rider toys in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at the chance to see whether it would live up to the price.I've got to tell you, guys. I'm eating my words.My four sons (ages 4-11) have not put the thing down since we got it. We have to set a timer to keep it fair and make sure everyone gets a chance to play with it, and today my 6-year-old was overheard telling a friend ""This is my funnest toy ever."" It's so funny to me because it's not electronic, it doesn't make sounds, it doesn't even have mechanical parts aside from the posable wings, but they just love it and their imaginations soar when they play with it.Here's some features that I particularly like about it:* It's bigger than it seems in the picture. From wingtip to wingtip, it's about 14 inches wide, and approximately 7 inches from the ground to the tops of the wings.* The little knight rider has a magnet in his bum, and there is one in the saddle. When you get him close to the saddle you can feel the pull of the magnets and that helps my 4-year-old in particular get him seated properly so there is no frustration for him. The magnet is strong enough to keep the rider on the griffin even when turned upside down and flown through the air with great enthusiasm, but they can still easily pull him off when they want to.*The knight's hand is shaped with a circle opening that the spear easily slides into and out of. No need to snap it into place, which can be difficult for smaller fingers.* The wings are not moved by a mechanical lever or button. They are on a ball-and-socket joint and can actually rotate a full 360 degrees. They move easily, but the wings are secure enough in the joint that they stay in whatever position you put them in until you want to change it.  Depending on the angle of the wings, the griffin can look like he's flying or resting or bowing, which my boys love and it spurs their imaginations.* It's beautifully painted and incredibly detailed.In summary, this is a fantastic toy for kids of all ages and I love that all four of my boys can enjoy it. It does seem pricey but I think it's a toy that will last for years and years and is worth the price. I will be investing in more of these Schleich toys to add to our collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUO0MIXYHRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1D7CRE#wasThisHelpful","R3KUO0MIXYHRU","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, you're burnt out on the New Adult genre.You've read 30.5 books this year about fictional girls having the same college experience, like they are in some sort of perverted episode of the Twilight Zone. They have all been raped, abused, or raised by wealthy parents who do not care about them and keep them from the one they love, but its ok because after one roll in the hay with the reformed bad boy, these girls have life figured out. They get over their past, they stand up to their parents, they pass the test and save the day.And you're just over it.Yeah? Me too.And that is probably why I loved Fangirl and Cath so much. Because her college experience did not read like a Teen Harlequin novel. It read like my life.""Look at you. You've got your s*** together, you're not scared of anything. I'm scared of everything. And I'm crazy. Like maybe you think I'm a little crazy, but I only ever let people see the tip of my crazy iceberg. Underneath this veneer of slightly crazy and mildly socially retarded, I'm a complete disaster."" -- Cath, to her roomate RaeganI loved that the angst in it was so subtle and yet I kept having these little electric waves of emotion roll through my chest on Cath's behalf: as she's navigating her classes... as she feels betrayed when her identical twin doesn't want to be her roommate and finds a new best friend... as she's struggling to feel comfortable in her own dorm room because she's living with a fairly intimidating (yet ultimately awesome) upperclassman named Reagan... as she reluctantly begins to interact with other people and learns the hard way that some can be trusted and some are just using you to get ahead... as she falls in love for the first time. All of the tension in this book felt authentic and not overdone, not over-the-top, and yet left my heart a little bruised. Because this is the angst that real people experience their freshman year of college, and I saw myself in it.With that being said, I'm not kidding when I tell you Cath is the opposite of the typical NA heroine. She's awkward and has a bad case of social anxiety and is more firmly planted in her internet reality than actual reality; but she is also endearing and smart and Rainbow Rowell helps us understand her.I've never written fanfiction, or read fanfiction, or even really been aware that fanfiction existed, but the point of the book was not to make me a fanfiction groupie. The point was to show the journey of one girl's first year in college, and that girl happened to be an incredibly talented writer of fanfiction. Cath writes slash fiction about Simon & Baz, who are the main characters in a Harry Potterish series, and there is quite a bit of talk about her fanfic throughout the book. Even though I can't identify with that personally, it didn't turn me off like I expected it to. Throughout the course of the book it even grew on me because Cath was growing on me, and I cared about her. Also, her roommate was there for comic relief and to say the things that most of us would be thinking if we were actually interacting with Cath.Quotes from her roommate Reagan:""What do you mean when you write them? No, you know what? Nevermind. I don't want to know. It's already hard enough to make eye contact with you.""""You're just so helpless sometimes. It's like watching a kitten with its head trapped in a Kleenex box.""Cath is sometimes frustrating because you want to rush her, to force her to make the right decisions and to stop pushing people away. But that's why this is a coming-of-age tale and not a romance, although the love story in it gave me a true case of ""the feels."" It was well done, sweetly and slowly built, and even though it wasn't totally believable (he was almost too perfect) I was rooting for both of them. My cheeks hurt from smiling during their interactions and when it finally happened I felt a little giddy.If you're looking for a steamy romance with a first-person POV, this isn't your book. It's extremely chaste. But if you love character-driven stories with humor, realistic dialogue, and a sweet love story, this is one of my favorites from 2013.

"**Warning** Portions of this review will be spoilerish if you haven't read the first book yet, but I will do my best not to reveal any major spoilers for Fractured. Proceed at your own discretion.**Okay! Let's talk Fractured, the highly anticipated sequel to Sanctum (Guards of the Shadowlands)!I was thrilled to get an advance copy of Fractured and I went into it with high expectations. The cover alone had me drooling. I wanted it to really wow me and make me forget the things that I didn't like about the first book (the instalove between Malachi and Lela and the fact that they both martyred themselves for someone who didn't really deserve it). I wanted an epic battle between the Mazikin and the guards of the Shadowlands. I wanted to learn more about the Shadowlands and some of the other dimensions there. And I really wanted to see some growth in Malachi and Lela's relationship. Unfortunately, as you can tell from my mild 2.5-3 star rating, while there were things that I liked about it, overall Fractured left me feeling just sort of 'meh.'Lela and Malachi have been dropped back in Lela's hometown where they are patrolling for the escaped Mazikin. Malachi is now a foreign exchange student and Raphael is his ""host father"" (ha! loved that) and they are attending Lela's highschool. Life for Lela has returned to normal, as normal as it can be considering she was dead the week before. They are given two new team members to help with the monumental task of defending the world, both of whom are from different dimensions of the Shadowlands. Through them we get to learn a little bit about The Bright City and the Wastelands, both of which sounded fascinating. I wished that there were more people on the team and that we could have learned more about where they were from, but apparently the Judge thought four would be plenty. Four against possibly thousands of Mazikin, who can reincarnate as quickly as they can grab a new homeless person to possess. Right, no problemo.Anyway, the problem I had with this book isn't necessarily the premise or the writing, both of which were pretty good. My problem is that the author chose to take her characters out of a world that was mysterious and new to the reader, and dropped them back in the humdrum human world and made them highschool students. She tried to straddle the line between paranormal suspense and highschool drama, but wasn't quite successful at either, and I was distracted with feeling like a lot of it was silly.I just could never get on board with Lela being the captain of the team and Malachi being the lieutenant. I know it was the Judge's decision at the end of the first book, but it felt really ridiculous considering Lela didn't even know how to pull her own knife without killing herself and Malachi is so clearly a leader (um, hello, 70 years of experience!). I hated that Lela was the one calling the shots because she hadn't earned the right to do so. She hadn't learned enough or grown enough to be the captain and that made it difficult for me to take her seriously.My other biggest complaint with this book is that it climaxed way too late. The first 50 pages or so were pretty good, and I was really enjoying myself, and then it just started to draaaag. Malachi and Lela's relationship hit a snag, which was inevitable, but the author spent the next 200 pages keeping them apart and introducing mediocre characters for both Malachi and Lela to torture each other with. One of my favorite things from the first book was the lack of a love triangle, so when I saw it going that way I was annoyed. It never felt like a legitimate concern, because we know Malachi loves Lela, but it did feel rather pointless.When they weren't dodging googly eyes from their classmates and agonizing over who they'd attend prom with, they were endlessly patrolling the city, sniffing the air for incense so they could bag them some Mazikin. If the last 50 pages of the book had happened in the middle of the story, I would have given this book 4 stars, but there was just too much walking walking walking and never getting anywhere, and it left me feeling like all the good stuff is being saved for the next book.I know a lot of people were hoping for more Mazikin action in this book, and I think those people will be pleased. There are several altercations between the Guards and the Mazikin, who have been terrorizing the local homeless population and threatening to kill Malachi and Lela's new-found friends, and it all comes to a head in an explosive and shocking cliffhanger ending. This will have most readers chomping at the bit for the next book, but for me personally, I felt detached and only vaguely interested in what was happening. Maybe because there was too much focus on irrelevant things, such as three pages describing a date Lela had with Ian, and not enough time on the things I wanted to know about, such as when one of her teammates was captured and tortured by the Mazikin. I just wanted the focus of the story to be on Lela growing into her role as captain of the guard, but felt it was overshadowed by petty things.Anyways, my rating for this book is just based on my own personal enjoyment of the story and the things that hung me up may not be an issue for you. This particular installation had some good parts, but overall it lacked the things that I liked from the first book (the intrigue of the Shadowlands and the sweetness between Malachi and Lela) and took a turn into the mundane by returning to the living world and focusing too much on highschool drama.Final Verdict: I think that people who were fans of the first book should read this to see if they like where the series is going and decide for themselves if they want to continue, but I don't know if I will be reading the next one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1QRCV1JFCAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477817298#wasThisHelpful","R1I1QRCV1JFCAA","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shatter Me, Shatter Me, what shall I say about you? You may get the award for ""most intriguing plot smothered with the most annoying prose"" and yet I still like you. At first I enjoyed the descriptions. They were lyrical. They were evocative. They painted emotions with words.And then it started to distract me from the story. That was hard to do because this is the story of a girl who is locked in an insane asylum, alone for almost a year with nothing but a tiny notebook to scratch down her frazzled thoughts, a girl who cannot touch or be touched because her skin is deadly. I was drawn in immediately and bought into the story, the world-building, and the characters. I loved it all.My biggest hangup however, and the thing that very nearly killed the book for me, was the dang purple prose. According to Wikipedia, the definition of purple prose is:""...written prose that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself. Purple prose is sensually evocative beyond the requirements of its context. It may also employ certain rhetorical effects such as exaggerated sentiment or pathos in an attempt to manipulate a reader's response.""See also, Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi.Juliette could never just be surprised by something. Her jaw was always ""dangling from her shoelaces"" or becoming debris on the floor or swinging in the breeze. This annoyed me more than I expected and I started rolling my eyes when I should have been enjoying the story.With that being said, however, I still recommend this book because the plot was strong and the last portion of the book took the storyline in a direction I completely didn't expect. Suddenly I was getting excited to read the sequel, when midway through I just wanted it to be over. My main goal in writing this review now is to encourage someone who is is turned off by the prose, but otherwise enjoys the concept, to stick with it. The next two books (one is a novella called Destroy Me) were so much better and the author does tone the prose down quite a bit.I'm actually surprised to find myself fully invested in the series and really looking forward to the third book. This is one of those books that's worth getting through because the series only goes up from here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1RTR2H8KF2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00526VVN2#wasThisHelpful","R1Z1RTR2H8KF2R","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been blowing up my goodreads feed lately. Lots of people have been throwing glittery stars and puffy hearts at it, and I was intrigued. Because for some reason I am always intrigued by the plot lines on NA books. A small-town girl, recently orphaned, who heads to Nashville to follow her dream? She somehow gets noticed and brought on tour with a handsome older star, but they don't like eachother and the sparks fly? Yes, please.Admittedly, I didn't go into this book expecting an epic read. I expected a fun guilty-pleasure book to pass some time in between heavier stuff. I wanted to spend some time in Nashville and experience what it would be like to work your way up the ladder in the music industry and finally get your big break. I wanted to know how a girl would feel if she went from being a struggling-waitress nobody to suddenly being the opening-act for last year's Country Music Artist of the Year, literally overnight. I wanted to see their relationship progress from hate to love and feel happy for them in the end. Maybe my expectations and wants were unreasonable.What I got was a frustrating mish-mash of plot devices, a girl who started out strong and likable and wound up weak and co-dependent, a hero with a drinking problem who I didn't like or care about, inconsistent and unbelievable behavior from the main characters, and some really ridiculous WTF moments that made my suspension-of-disbelief switch short circuit.I actually really liked the beginning of this book, especially the scenes set in the bar and her interactions with Tonya, the single working mom who helped her get the job. I liked the idea of her signing up months in advance to get a single shot at amateur night and having to re-work her song at the last minute and get someone to cover her tables so she could run up there and sing. But after that it just started going downhill. There was no fleshing out what happened between her big performance and her suddenly standing on stage as opening act for Trace Corbin. We are told she did this and did that, but didn't get to see any of it or experience it with her. It all felt very forced to me.This book was all about her relationship with Trace, but that was a mystery to me as well. I had to wait half the book to find out Trace was 26... I honestly expected him to be a lot older with the way he was described. What exactly did he do or say, besides glare at her a few times and make her look like an idiot at her very first show, to cause her to suddenly develop feelings for him? Lust I could understand, but feelings strong enough that she would give up her goals, her promise to her father, and her self respect? I think this book just pushed one of my big `hell no' buttons: the one where a girl gives up who she is and everything she says she wants to get the guy, and then something silly happens that makes him doubt her and he treats her like crap, and then she winds up apologizing to him.I'm actually not one to be overly feministic or do a cheer over girl-power, but during Kylie's speech to Trace on the bus, the one she gave after he said some really hateful things, I wanted to shake the girl and beg her to just. stop. talking. Where is your self-respect?? Please, shut up and walk out with some dignity! But she wouldn't listen to me and I was embarrassed for her.In conclusion, I didn't like this book. I admit that I am stingy with my stars and maybe my expectations for this genre are too high... although I have read several new-adult books that I did really enjoy so I know its possible to write a somewhat believable smutty fluff read. The key to a good guilty-pleasure book is the suspension of disbelief. Did the author suck me into her world and make me like her characters and the story enough that I could forget the scenarios are far-fetched and stuff like that doesn't happen to normal people? Did she make me root for the characters? Did she keep the plot going without resorting to silly misunderstandings and immature behavior? For this book, for me personally, the answer is `no'.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCA3MMLWUXSCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484835263#wasThisHelpful","RCA3MMLWUXSCF","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ugh, I hate being the first negative review of a book. People tend to say your review was unhelpful just because they disagree, but I'm going to put myself out there anyways.I went into this book with high hopes because of all the glowing five-star-across-the-board reviews, so I was probably even more disappointed when I found myself skimming most of the second half. I'm giving it 2.5 stars because it wasn't terrible, it had some interesting things going for it, but it wasn't for me and I was mostly bored through the whole thing.I actually did like the author's take on mythology for this book, and thought it was clever to give them a more human backstory. However, I really didn't care for the reincarnation line. I thought it would have been a much better story without any modern day characters or rehashing of past lives. That could have been interesting, but it wasn't because she didn't go into any of them in depth, they were just used to string us along until the ""big reveal."" If only she had just told us the story of Hades and Persephone using her unique spin. Instead, we have these modern day characters who are supposedly the umpteenth reincarnation of some ancient gods, and ""Persephone"" spends most of the book trying to remember her previous lives so she can decide if she likes ""Hades"" or not. In order to do this, she has to sleep... a lot. She just kept sleeping so she could dream to find out what happened, and then they'd hug and visit his airstream trailer for some chaste studying or to throw a stick for his dog, then he'd take her home. There were some bad guys, who were not very scary, thrown in just to keep us on our toes too.Overall, I just felt that the relationship between Aiden and.. I can't even remember her name.. felt like puppy love and I just didn't care about any of them. I didn't buy that these two people had been connected by a deep and lasting love through countless lifetimes.I know that there have been several Hades and Persephone stories put out recently but I haven't read any of them, so this was my first chance to be wowed. I wanted to be, but I just... wasn't.

"I have a feeling that if I re-read this book after the third and final installment is out, I will like it a lot more than I do right now. That's why I'm giving it four stars. I'm supremely frustrated with the ending, and was bored for the first third of the book, but the last 14% was worth the whole read and I'm still fully invested in this series. I need closure on this whole Aren/Kyol situation, especially since it was so beautifully black and white right up till the end.""I left Kyol because I wasn't myself when I was with him. I was careful with my thoughts, my words, and my actions. I tried to become someone I wasn't all because I wanted to be worthy of him. I don't feel that way with Aren. If we work out, it will be because we work, not because we're changing ourselves to meet the other's expectations."" -- McKenzieThe choice was very clear and McKenzie wasn't wishy-washy about it, even when it was painful, which I really admired. But now the author has presented us with a conundrum and I don't know how it will all work out, or even if it will. Also, I would like to state for the record that I am ""schmexy scene frustrated."" So close so many times, and yet so far away. What good are those zingy lightning bolts if no one ever gets to enjoy them?If you loved the first book, I definitely recommend continuing with the series... but you may want to wait until December 2013 so you can have closure a lot sooner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17FEXV11RB15M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EXO25Y#wasThisHelpful","R17FEXV11RB15M","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know if its just that I've read way too many J.Lynn/Armentrout books in the last couple months, or if I'm burned out on the NA genre already, or maybe because it's July and this book is set in a snow storm, but I'm adding this book to my ""great shelf of meh."" I feel like I've read it all before. Probably because I have.*There was a hot boy with dark hair, but his eyes were brown in this book, not blue or green. I guess she's changing it up.* There were abs. Serious abs. Not a six pack, an eight pack.* There were several oaths using some sort of reference to babies... ""For the love of babies everywhere!"" or even, ""I wanted to cry like a fat, ugly baby"" I don't really understand it, but there will be a baby reference in every Jennifer Armentrout book you read, mark my words.*Nobody dipped their french fries in mayonnaise in this book. I was almost disappointed.* There was steamy smexy stuff, and I will not argue the fact that J. Lynn can really write a love scene.The story itself wasn't bad, it was just sort of middle of the road and there wasn't much that made me want to keep turning pages. The subplot with them being sabotaged during a snowstorm wasn't even a mystery, we all knew who it was from the beginning... well, except for Kyler and Sydney. They were pretty surprised. It felt a little silly and overly dramatic when the majority of the book really centered on Kyler and Sydney working out their changing relationship once they were snowed in. They had a lot of issues to work through and could have spent more time actually doing that if J.Lynn wasn't busy trying to make the book more exciting.I dunno. I think I just like a little more mystery in my books. I want to wonder how it will end, and be excited to flip pages to get there. These NA college romances can be sweet, but they are predictable. If you don't mind knowing how it will end from the get-go, and you want a little escapism, then go for it. I think I'm over it, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A55XDV95JQD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CONW5I6#wasThisHelpful","R1A55XDV95JQD1","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 4 and 6-year-old boys have hardly put this camera down since we got it. It's the perfect shape and weight for their hands, looks like a ""real"" dslr camera, has a minimum of big easy-to-figure-out buttons, and entertains them for long stretches of time.Straight out of the box they were able to start using it with hardly any explanation, although it does come with a colorful instruction sheet that is very easy to understand. If your kids can work your smart phone, this camera will be a breeze.My favorite features:* It's sturdy, and even after being dropped several times is still functioning fine* It has sound effects for each button so the kids hear the 'snap' of the picture taking and the 'crunch' when they delete a photo, and when they switch the lever to slideshow mode fun music plays.* They love using the silly overlays to put mustaches on pictures of mom and super hero costumes on pictures of dad.* The slideshow  projector feature works great, with just the flip of a lever, and they love sitting in closets or darkened hallways and watching their pictures light up the wall. They get the instant gratification of seeing and showing their pictures without bothering me with a usb or a computer. Although if they do happen to get a really good shot that I want to save, I can use my real camera's usb cord (the toy does not come with one) to download it onto my computer and the resolution will be higher off of the toy (although still not high quality... like a 3 mg cell phone quality).* It holds a lot of photos, 300+I don't have any complaints about it, but here a couple of things to note:* You need a small screwdriver to take off the bottom panel and change the 4 AA batteries. We've been using it for a few days without needing to replace them but the battery light has been blinking so I will need to do that soon. I recommend investing in a set of rechargeable batteries to go with the camera.* If the kids say the camera is suddenly not working, but it's still making sounds, they probably accidentally flipped the lever into the slideshow position. If the room is bright you can't see the slideshow so it can be hard to tell if it's in that mode.All in all, this is a GREAT toy for 4-7 year olds, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262TOKX8ERJ8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWNUHB2#wasThisHelpful","R262TOKX8ERJ8Z","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Grisha Trilogy by Leigh Bardugo, so if you're reading this review you're most likely already invested in the series and wondering whether to continue. I say yes!The writing in this installment is just as compelling, the story is mostly fast-paced and hard to put down, there are new characters to love and new enemies to fear. It picks up almost immediately where the first book left off, following Mal and Alina on their voyage across the True Sea and straight into conflict with the Darkling, who has been irrevocably changed by the battle on the Fold in which Alina left him to die. He brings with him creatures more frightening than the Volcra and it will take more power, and new friends, in order for Alina and Mal to survive.The love story took a backseat to action and intrigue in this book, and I missed it. The author managed to string me along with just enough tension to keep me going, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't frustrated with the state of Alina and Mal's relationship. Alina is now the highest ranking Grisha in the land and for several reasons cannot be connected publicly with Mal. Their moments together are brief and melancholy, and their relationship seems more doomed by the moment. Alina's power is growing and her purpose is clear, but poor Mal.... He doesn't know his place in her world anymore, and because he chose to desert the army in the first book he lost his position as a valued tracker. Mal winds up having a sort of identity crisis, though his love for her is true.""No, Alina. You came here for Ravka.... to lead the Second Army."" He tapped the sun over his heart. ""I came here for you. You're my flag. You're my nation."" ~MalIt's really hard to review second books in a trilogy before all the books have been published, because they are inevitably a little less satisfying. There will always be more questions than answers, and there will always be amped up conflict and hopelessness in order to keep readers hungering for the conclusion. Siege and Storm is no exception. I was swept away with the first half of the book, caught up in the adventure and the introduction of new and compelling characters (who doesn't love a handsome pirate?!), but the middle of the book dragged for me. Things slowed down when Alina took over the Second Army and there was a lot of war-room talk and squabbles with the Grisha, which would have been fine except it all seemed sort of moot because of what happened at the end.Overall it was an enjoyable installment in the series, and I recommend it, but it will be even better when the whole series is out and can be enjoyed without interruption. For the book by itself I give it 3.5 stars, but as a connecting piece in a bigger story, it gets 4 stars from me. If you're not dying to know what happens, I think you could wait on this one until the last book is out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0J2E35X2XBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805094601#wasThisHelpful","R2E0J2E35X2XBR","A3LKLGZZ8OWR51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKLGZZ8OWR51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here are my thoughts on the movie Trainwreck.Trainwreck introduces us to Amy. Amy works at S'Nuff magazine; but she also sleeps with a lot of guys, drinks quite a bit of alcohol, and smokes pot. After things go awry with her current fling Steven(he may look familiar), Amy's boss Dianna gives Amy the task of writing an article on Dr. Aaron Conners. A date with Dr. Conners makes Amy realize that she may have indeed found her perfect match.I'll be honest, I am not the biggest fan of romantic comedies, but Judd Apatow gives us one of the better movies of the summer. The movie is often funny as it is enjoyable; and much of the attention goes to Trainwreck's primary star Amy Schumer. She was hilarious throughout the movie and shared really great chemistry alongside her co-star Bill Hader who plays Doctor Conners. Lebron James stars as himself and also is fun to watch throughout the film.Numerous times while viewing Trainwreck I kept thinking "" eventually this movie is gonna stop being so good"". Much to my surprise, the story doesn't have a boring or dull moment. Whenever I watch comedies, I am usually expecting some jokes to be funny and some jokes that aren't exactly funny. I definitely commend the comedic timing of the jokes in the movie. And thanks to the script, which was penned by Amy Schumer herself, Trainwreck has both humor and a talented cast to make the movie both entertaining and satisfying. Amy Schumer is the star of the movie-and she plays her role VERY well. And to conclude, Trainwreck succeeds very well as a movie thanks to the talented cast led by Amy Schumer, the direction of Judd Apatow, the comedic timing, and because the movie itself is thoroughly entertaining. I had a wonderful time with Trainwreck and consider it to be:A Very Good ExperienceRated RNote: I was highly distressed to hear that Mayci Breaux and Jillian Johnson were killed and that others were injured at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana while viewing Trainwreck. This act of violence is heartbreaking and my thoughts and condolences are with each individual's family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS60X0O7YX8ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VRP4EC#wasThisHelpful","RS60X0O7YX8ED","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been anticipating this movie for quite some time. Directed by Antoine Fuqua and backed by the song ""Phenomenal"" by Eminem, here is my review on the movie Southpaw.Billy Hope is an undefeated boxer who has it all: nice house, nice cars, his wife and his little girl. Billy soon makes the announcement that he's going to retire; but tragedy strikes Billy in the most unspeakable manner after a fight ensues between Billy and rival competitor Miguel Escobar. With the help of his new coach Titus Willis, Billy retrains himself to win: Win back his daughter and win back his life.Coming off his brilliant performance in last year's Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaal gives another impressive as Billy Hope. I was amazed at how well Jake Gyllenhaal was able to play Billy as a broken man, Billy the father, and Billy the fighter. Something I have noticed as a moviegoer is that Jake Gyllenhaal has a true commanding presence whenever he's on-screen. He embodies all these  different emotions in the character which made him utterly convincing as a boxer. His co-stars Curtis Jackson and Forest Whitaker also reward Southpaw with respectable performances. I especially enjoyed the scenes between Billy Hope and Forest Whitaker's character Titus. And even Rachel McAdams who plays Billy's wife Maureen is wonderful to watch-as is Oona Laurence who is exceptional in her role as their daughter Leila. All in all, Southpaw has terrific performances all around.Southpaw has a emotionally charged story. As a result, there are quite a few tear jerking moments, but Southpaw's focus on Billy's fight, will, and the relationship with his daughter are what drive the movie. I also like the way the fight scenes were set up; and whenever there is a boxing match in Southpaw, it looks like you are watching an actual fight. With a strong lead performance in Jake Gyllenhaal, a fantastic ensemble in the supporting cast (especially Forest Whitaker), the moving spirit of the story, the strategic fight scenes, and the applauding direction of Antoine Fuqua, Southpaw isn't just a great boxing movie-It's a GREAT movie period. Though it is still relatively early in the year, it will be a shame if the awards snub Jake Gyllenhaal yet again, because his performance is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  And the movie Southpaw isA Good ExperienceRated R","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Z85Q3ZM6X4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BPM536#wasThisHelpful","R29Z85Q3ZM6X4A","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to grow with each release. From this year's success of Avengers Age of Ultron, and even last year's surprise in Guardians Of The Galaxy, they continue to entertain and create wonder.

Scott's daughter Cassie is having her birthday, but her mom's fiance Jim refuses to allow Scott to see his daughter unless he provides child support. A failed attempt at Baskin Robbins leaves Scott no choice but to go back to his ways; and upon attempting to execute a robbery, Scott discovers a suit-the Ant-Man suit.I was a little surprised when Paul Rudd was first cast as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, but he is actually a joy to watch as the character. Rudd is his usual humorous self numerous times in the movie-but when he with his daughter Cassie, there are moments that you can't help but smile and make him even more likable. And it could certainly be argued that both Michael Douglas and Michael Pena nearly steal the show in the movie. Michael Pena's character Luis is both humorous and clever, but Michael Douglas's Hank Pym is perhaps the most fitting and fulfilling character to watch throughout the film. Corey Stoll also does a good job as antagonist Darren Cross/Yellowjacket; while Evangeline Lily's character Hope make a nice addition to the cast along with rapper/actor TI who plays Dave.In terms of storytelling, Ant-Man rewards the audience with both humor and action; but also some notable references/easter eggs of what is to come in the future of Marvel films. If I told you what they were, I would be spoiling them entirely-but I will say that once the scenes between the credits began to play, I could not help but to smile even harder. And I definitely enjoyed the 3rd act of the movie-SERIOUSLY I do feel the 3rd act of the movie is the strongest act of the movie. Ant-Man is even better when you get to see the fight scenes, and Paul Rudd in the Ant-Man suit. But as a movie, Ant-Man proves that Marvel will continue to entertain and reward audiences everywhere; thanks to a very likable cast(especially Douglas, Pena, and Rudd), the story(which delivers an engrossing 3rd act), and the direction of Peyton Reed. I enjoyed Ant-Man and consider the movie to beA GOOD ExperienceRated PG-13Phase 3Captain America Civil War-May 6, 2016Doctor Strange-November 4, 2016Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2-May 5, 2017New Spider-Man Film-July 28, 2017Thor Ragnarok-November 3, 2017Avengers Infinity War Part 1-May 4, 2018Black Panther-July 6, 2018Captain Marvel-November 2, 2018Avengers Infinity War Part 2-May 3, 2019Inhumans-July 12, 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K18S2GYE7R4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGDK2EU#wasThisHelpful","R3K18S2GYE7R4P","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are my thoughts on the movie Max.After his brother Kyle is killed in war, his loyal companion Max is distraught; not wanting to listen to anyone. Once Max sees Kyle's younger brother Justin, Justin becomes the person that Max warms up to for the moment. Later, Justin and his family begin to ponder the circumstances of what really happened to Kyle, as Kyle's war friend Tyler returns to town.In terms of acting, I really enjoyed Thomas Haden Church's outing as Kyle's and Justin's dad Ray. Robbie Amell plays Kyle; and though he's not given much screentime, I feel he did a good job. The dog who plays ""Max"" named Carlos is the star of the film; and Max as a movie is at its best when the dog is on-screen. There are some touching moments in the movie, mostly due to Max the dog himself.Max's pacing as a movie can be uneven at times. Certain scenes in the beginning of the movie would feel rushed and some of the dialogue would have me scratching my head. That too-and Josh Wiggins, who plays Justin Wincott was just not convincing enough as one of the leads. But in spite of its shortcomings, Max still is enjoyable-even if its not great, due to the adventure of the movie, the better and more likable performances coming from Thomas Haden Church and Robbie Amell, and because you can't help but like Max the dog himself. So though it won't please everyone, the movie Max isAn Above Average ExperienceRated PG","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D5WGH5OJYYKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ36S52#wasThisHelpful","R3D5WGH5OJYYKO","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something to be said about a movie that has a 5.5 rating currently on IMDB. Lets take a look at Survivor.Kate is an employee of the American Embassy who at the moment is suspicious of a man Dr. Balan who is trying to get a Visa. Later while attending a birthday party, Kate and her friends endure an explosion; of which her friends are killed but she is alive. Kate soon realizes that she is being hunted by a hitman known only as ""The Watchmaker"".Survivor has a cast consisting of Pierce Brosnan, Milla Jovovich, Angela Bassett, and James D'Arcy. Though I am used to seeing Pierce Brosnan playing the good guy, his performance in Survivor made for an interesting take as ""The Watchmaker"". His character is fearless with a gun and determined to kill Kate. I found it interesting how his character seemed so invisible to the other characters besides Kate in the movie. Milla Jovovich's character Kate was easy to follow; she is not necessarily a ""no-holds barred"" type of charcter per se, but she easily eludes danger in the toughest fashion.The story is fast but is still easy to follow. Some of the dialogue had me raising my eyebrows, but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie. IF I had to sort of compare this with another spy flick-it almost is like the 2010 movie Salt in a sense. As its own movie, Survivor manages to entertain thanks to an impressive cast(notably Pierce Brosnan), the thrill of the story, and the fact that I find it all around enjoyable.

"It took me three years after the release of Despicable Me to finally watch it, and when I did-I ended up loving it. Now here we are two years after Despicable Me 2's release; as today I give my thoughts on the movie Minions.The film opens to a narration, as the narrator explains that the minions have existed long before time itself. You see, the minions want to find the most villainous person they can, and serve that villain. After numerous failed attempts, in 1968 minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, arrive in New York where they find out about a Villain-Con and are introduced to female villain Scarlet Overkill.Even though Edith, Margo, and Agnes are not present in this movie, Minions still manages to provide both humor and adventure for both kids and adults alike. Minions also sports a star-studded cast: Jon Hamm as Herb, Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill and Geoffrey Rush lending his voice as the narrator. Pierre Coffin does a nice job voicing minions Kevin, Bob, and Stuart.The movie's story progresses in a relatively timely manner; which I feel is a good thing. The animation is as colorful and as rewarding as the previous movies. If there is one complaint I found with Minions; its that Scarlet Overkill is not as interesting a villain as Gru. Even still, Minions proves to serve as a solid prequel due to the voice actors/actresses, the animation, the story, and because the Minions themselves are just so darn cool!So while we continue to wait for 2017's Despicable Me 3, I will say that though the movie is not perfect, Minions is still an entertaining movie nonetheless. And I have a feeling that the ending of the movie will make fans of the original movies smile just as much as I did. In the end, Minions isA Good ExperienceRated PGDespicable Me 3-June 30, 2017","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q98STI18RH8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC73JW#wasThisHelpful","R1Q98STI18RH8M","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sorely missed out on this movie due to lack of interest and because January is a month notorious for releasing bad movies. However, once I watched Project Almanac in its entirety today, I was surprised at how good it actually is. Lets take a look.Making a video for a MIT admission, David and his friends/sister: Adam, Quinn and Christina, assist and watch as David uses controls from his fingers to make an airplane fly. After being accepted, David's excitement quickly turns to dismay as he only receives $5,000 in tuition. Soon, David and his friends come across a camera left by David's father, and a device called: Project Almanac.Found footage movies are not very prominent in today's cinema, but Project Almanac proves that just because this is a found footage film, you don't necessarily have to be 3 guys with superpowers, or on a doomed trip to research a legendary witch. Even though Project Almanac revolves around time-travel, I like how the movie offers some humorous moments and how each actor/actress plays his/her part. Jonny Weston's outing as lead character David is impressive and interesting to watch, and David endures some fun adventures throughout the course of the movie-even though as a viewer you realize that something bad is bound to happen.Story wise, there were times when the script felt uneven, but Project Almanac still manages to be interesting nonetheless. The effects are not mind-blowing mind you, but for Project Almanac (being a found footage movie) that is not a bad thing. Where I feel Project Almanac succeeds most is whenever the lead character David(Jonny Weston) is on-screen and when the story shifts from being fun-to the ""Ok if we keep doing this something bad will happen"". I also liked the funny/clever references to the movie Looper and the Terminator. And though it may not exactly reach the heights of found footage movies like Chronicle, Project Almanac offers a unique story in the form of found footage, thanks to an impressive and likable cast led by Jonny Weston's character David, the pacing of the (sometimes uneven but still enjoyable) story, and the timely manner of which the movie is executed. The ending may leave you questioning would there perhaps be a sequel, but overall Project Almanac isAn Above Average ExperienceRated PG-13","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGY8JY9K7EQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9NXKRI#wasThisHelpful","R2UGY8JY9K7EQM","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are my thoughts on the movie Maggie.After a event that causes ""The Turn"" also called the: Necroambulist virus, Maggie's father Wade is looking for Maggie after she calls him to tell him to not look for her. Later, Maggie is revealed to be in the hospital, as she has been bitten and the infection itself will soon take over her body and turn Maggie into a zombie. Wade vows to keep his daughter safe even though both police and doctors warn Wade that the inevitable will soon happen.Going in, I was not expecting much from Maggie. However I rather enjoyed the movie. And Maggie is not just a typical zombie movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a very good performance in Maggie. He sticks with his daughter Maggie(portrayed wonderfully by Abigail Breslin) all the way to the very end and is constantly defending her out of the love he has for her. Both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin did well as the lead characters.The movie has a dark feel to it; the cinematographical scope and the music attribute to its dark feel; and the story itself is rather depressing. What seperates Maggie from a lot of zombie flicks is that it doesn't have a million zombies running around and you have to kill each and every one of them, Maggie's emotional core comes from the human characters, and the bond between father and daughter. Maggie is an apocalyptic film; and if you have seen the movie The Road, or played the acclaimed PS3/PS4 game The Last of Us, you'll definitely see some similarities. Though, as its own film, I consider Maggie to be a good movie due to the exceptional performances by the leads(Abigail Breslin and Arnold Schwarzenegger), the story, and the movie's cinematography. In the end, Maggie isA Good ExperienceRated PG-13NOTE: I almost missed out on this movie due to the initial negative feedback it was receiving.I always find it interesting when a movie receives a negative reception, yet sometimes audiences find that movie enjoyable. My hope is that with each and every individual review I do on a particular film, is that I offer you my thought on why I feel a certain movie is good or bad; and being if it is good or great I hope that my words are even more encouraging. Usually, when I say ""GO SEE"" a certain film, I use that phrase as an creative/exciting way to persuade you to see a movie-that is my way of saying I want you to be just as excited as I am. My point is that I love the fact that I get to review movies for Amazon, but more importantly that I get to continue to review them for all of you who read them. At the end of the day my words of persuasion may be helpful or non-helpful, but the only opinion that counts is yours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQWQCI2TEGUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI057UM#wasThisHelpful","RWQWQCI2TEGUA","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to be honest, when I heard a few years back that there would be a fifth Terminator movie, I cringed a little. While no one can dispute that both Terminator 1 and Terminator 2 are incredible, the third movie and 2009's Salvation were not among the series best. When the trailer for Terminator Genisys was released, I did find myself to be intrigued and could not help but smile when Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in the preview. So finally, here is my review for the fifth movie in the Terminator trilogy: Terminator Genisys.Set in 2029, Terminator Genisys takes us to John Connor and Kyle Reese. The enemy group Skynet sends a T-800 back in time to kill Sarah Connor, and someone from the Resistance has to go back in time to stop the T-800 from killing Sarah. And almost instantly, Kyle Reese emerges as a volunteer to go back in time and face the T-800 and protect Sarah Connor.For the most part and much to my shock, Terminator Genisys is a good movie. There were times where I felt Jai Courtney's character Kyle Reese could have done more, and I don't feel that his chemistry with Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor was the best, but once Arnold Schwarzenegger is on the screen, you are reminded of WHY the Terminator is awesome in the first place. As a fan, I was both pleased and excited that the Terminator plays a vital part of Genisys and that Arnold Schwarzenegger is still very much likable as the popular character. I also enjoyed seeing Jason Clarke as John Connor, and Lee Byung-Hun as the T-1000. The action scenes are set up really well, while Terminator Genisys's story offers a unique take on the series.I was actually prepared to do a negative review on this movie and am still surprised at how good Terminator Genisys is. Terminator Genisys has wonderful action, a timely and correct pacing of the script, nice visuals, and delivers another enjoyable outing for Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Summer 2015 continues to have some exciting movie releases and I am happy to safely say that Terminator Genisys isA GOOD ExperienceRated PG-13","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335IGAH8L04P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01013FLNQ#wasThisHelpful","R335IGAH8L04P8","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you know Seth MacFarlane, and have followed shows such as American Dad, The Cleveland show and Family Guy, then you know his MacFarlane's sense of humor can be extreme. That being said, I am a fan of Seth MacFarlane's and I was excited to get the opportunity to see the sequel Ted 2.A year after getting married, Ted and Tami-Lynn are arguing constantly. After a suggestion from his co-worker, Ted decides to have a baby with Tami-Lynn. After hilarious attempts to get sperm donors, Tami-Lynn is discovered to be infertile; and Ted is later brought to attention as to whether he is a person or property.I want to start by saying that a lot of the jokes in Ted 2 are completely over-the-top. COMPLETELY. And surprisingly, I laughed a lot more than I expected to. Between the initial negative critical reviews, and because sometimes comedy sequels don't always live up to their predecessor, I lowered my expectations going into the movie. Thankfully, Ted 2 manages to do what the first did in an even better way in terms of comedy. Ted 2 has some pretty awesome cameos ala: Liam Neeson, Dennis Haysbert, Tom Brady, Sam Jones, and a few others, but Ted 2 benefits tremendously from its main characters Mark Wahlberg as John and Seth MacFarlane as Ted. I also enjoyed seeing Amanda Seyfried(does she not have the most gorgeous eyes ever?) as Samantha Jackson in Ted 2. While the humor itself was extremely funny and definitely over-the-top, Ted 2 also has an underlying message that also makes the movie better. And Ted 2 definitely goes out with a bang-an exceptionally funny one at that.While there were a few times where the jokes did not exactly hit right or just got didn't exactly make me laugh, Ted 2 is a very good movie that has some of the most downright over-the-top humor in recent memory, awesome cameos, the duo of Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg being reunited, and the story that provides both humor and has an actual message behind it. I can't say that a third Ted movie is or isn't likely, but in my opinion Ted 2 is:A Very Good ExperienceRated R","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4BKZ65WBIF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC4Q10#wasThisHelpful","R3L4BKZ65WBIF7","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pixar has made so many great movies over the last decade, and as a fan, it is hard to really say which one is my favorite. From Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, and UP, the company responsible for the Toy Story phenomenon has yet again delivered audiences a highly unique movie in Inside Out.Inside Out centers primarily on 11 year old Riley. Riley's emotions: Joy, Anger, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust, are shown to play a crucial part in how Riley responds, interacts, and feels in certain situations.  Joy, is shown to be her source of happiness, Fear to provide her safety, Anger to keep her life fair, Disgust to keep her from being stressed, and/or her likes/dislikes, and  Sadness a loner who doesn't feel she is actually needed for Riley to function. Soon Riley's family moves to San Francisco due to her father getting a new job, and Riley and her emotions are in for an unforgettable journey.Inside Out achieves so much in such a relatively short time frame which is impressive in its own right. And Pixar is clever in that way, they can tell a story with unique characters in a short period of time. Many have argued that the plot for Inside Out maybe to difficult for younger kids to follow, but I personally do not believe that should stop parents from taking kids to see Inside Out. As I enjoyed the animation, I enjoyed how Inside Out's story began to unfold. When the movie was over, Inside Out left me with a deep reminder of how Pixar can make you care about their characters, and Inside Out itself left me in thought of just how exactly my own emotions all work. Joy, lovable and always beaming Joy,  does everything she can to keep Riley happy, Anger the little red pyro is responsible for Inside Out's humor-as is Disgust. And though Sadness is a loner, Inside Out shows how all these little emotions are necessary in a humorous and touching way. Don't be surprised if you start to have tears in a few scenes because I certainly did. Pixar actually has two releases this year-one being Inside Out, and later in November The Good Dinosaur. Personally, I'd say Inside Out is not only this year's best animated movie, its one of the best movies of 2015.I encourage anyone young and old to GO SEE this new masterpiece that Pixar has on its hands. Inside Out is smart, its funny, its touching, and above all else, Inside Out is:A GREAT EXPERIENCERated PG","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK580AQWWJ8O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCX7XMY#wasThisHelpful","RK580AQWWJ8O3","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a moviegoer, one has to truly appreciate the spectacle that is the 1993 film Jurassic Park. After numerous production delays, Jurassic Park 4(as it was then called) went through different rewrites and directors; as director Colin Trevorrow eventually would be the director of the film. After a decade of rumors and production delays, it is safe to say that Jurassic World was well worth the wait.A plane ride and later a boat ride to the familiar island of Isla Nublar just off Costa Rica's coast, takes the two brothers Zach and Gray to Jurassic World to visit their Aunt Claire who just so happens to be the manager of the park. Later we meet Owen Grady a guy who trains the 'Velociraptors, and Claire later meets with Owen to convince him to look for vulnerabilities in the 'Indominus rex. Upon arrival however, it seems that the 'Indominus rex has escaped.Chris Pratt has become a very popular celebrity and rightfully so. As Owen Grady, Pratt brings his usual humor and charm; while also making Owen the guy you root for throughout the course of the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard also does a really wonderful job in Jurassic World as the operation manager Claire; she's not only easy on the eyes but she shares some good chemistry alongside Pratt. Ty Simpkins(who you may remember as Harley from Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson star as brothers Zach and Gray and do a nice job(especially Ty Simpkins), while Omar Sy stars in a supporting role as Barry alongside Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Vic Hoskins.In terms of story, I really enjoyed how Jurassic World feels like a sequel to the other movies; while also having notable references to the original. Not once did I get bored during the runtime of Jurassic World, and while I won't call this one better than the original, Jurassic World proves to be a worthy addition to the Jurassic Park trilogy, thanks to the actors/actresses, the direction of Colin Trevorrow, how well Jurassic World is able to be its own movie while still acknowledging the original, and the humor and thrill of the story.

"The last disaster movie I saw in recent memory was the 2009 movie 2012. Frankly, I think at that time I was more scared of the events in the movie itself as opposed to the supposed ""Mayan Prophecy"". I like disaster films that cause you to think as a viewer and allow your mind to ponder about all the possibilities if such a disaster could occur. And with no further adieu, here is my review on the movie San Andreas.After rescuing a girl from almost falling from her car to her death, Ray later calls his daughter to talk about their trip to San Francisco. Ray soon arrives at his soon to be ex-wife Emma's new home belonging to her new boyfriend Daniel. Over at the Hoover Dam, Dr.Park and Dr.Hayes are both currently investigating a possible earthquake, when suddenly a fault ruptures starting an earthquake. Upon further realization, Dr.Hayes realizes that the San Andreas fault is shifting; thereby on the verge of causing a massive earthquake.Over the past couple of years, Dwayne Johnson has made quite the name for himself. And he does a really good job as the helicopter rescue pilot Ray. Also starring in the movie is actor Paul Giamatti as Dr. Hayes and I definitely enjoyed his performance; due to how well his character is able to explain the cause that ultimately lead to the disastrous effects. Alexandra Daddario plays Ray's daughter Blake alongside actress Carla Gugino who portrays her mom Emma. I enjoyed Alexandra's performance, though there were times I felt that Carla Gugino could have done a bit more in certain scenes. Overall though, I was satisfied in terms of acting.In terms of story, there is not necessarily a major plot line to follow, but then again this IS a disaster movie. In that, you get these enormous earthquakes that cause massive destruction that ultimately ends up being really marvelous to look at; thanks to the impressive visual effects. Visually, San Andreas can do no wrong and is a gorgeous watch.And believe me when I say, once San Andreas DOES take off, there is no slowing it down. Even better, I found the third act of the movie to be executed exceptionally well; because of the still growing suspense, and due to a few touching moments between the main characters. And just so you know, San Andreas is a movie I encourage you to GO SEE because of the acting(just remember Carla Gugino does only just enough), the visual bravado, the pacing of the movie, the timely manner in which the story is executed, and the the exceptional payoff of the third act. It may not be a perfect disaster film or even the best disaster film, but it is one of the better disaster films in recent memory and that is why San Andreas isA GOOD ExperienceRated PG-13","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36NC6IQH86EIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGO1FQE#wasThisHelpful","R36NC6IQH86EIO","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my New Years resolutions for 2015 was to start reading more. Back in March as I was on YouTube, I keep seeing an ad pop up advertising a movie called Paper Towns. Finally, I decided to watch the trailer and immediately it captured my interest. Upon further research, I found out that author John Green (also wrote The Fault in Our Stars) penned the book to which the upcoming movie is based upon. So I bought the book and though I primarily review movies/TV Shows, here is my review on the novel Paper Towns.While Quentin is sleeping his neighbor (and longtime crush) Margo climbs through his window asking to use his parent's car in order to execute her plan of revenge against those who deserve it; like her ex-boyfriend Jase Worthington, Quentin's frequent bully Chuck Parson, and even Margo's best friend Becca. A night long drive around Orlando takes Quentin and Margo to places such as Sea World, Walmart, and even a nearby bank. The next day after all this has been done, Quentin arrives at home and comes face to face with a PI intent on knowing about the last interaction between Margo and Q, as it just so happens that Margo is gone.I'll try to be short as I do not want to reveal much at all, but overall I enjoyed Paper Towns. I found myself enjoying the fun-loving friendship between Quentin, Ben, and Radar, and certain characteristics that Quentin has I found relatable. Margo's free-spirited attitude, and Quentin's determination are what drive the novel, and to close, John Green's Paper Towns is most definitely an enjoyable read.Paper Towns Movie-July 24,2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RA5Z7NVG85A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014241493X#wasThisHelpful","R3RA5Z7NVG85A6","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few days ago, I was able to finally watch the 2012 sleeper film Pitch Perfect in its entirety. Impressed by not only Anna Kendrick's portrayal as Beca, Rebel Wilson's near show stealing comedic antics, and how Pitch Perfect didn't focus just on one but ALL its characters, I decided to go see the film Pitch Perfect 2.As the movie begins, we see the Barden Bellas currently performing at an A Capella performance being attended by none other than President and Mrs. Obama. After an extreme malfunction of sorts occurs, the Bellas find themselves suspended from being able to perform. The only way they will be able to perform again is to compete in an A Capella World tournament. Later, we meet Emily a freshman with aspirations of joining the Bellas, and so begins Pitch Perfect 2.Returning as Beca Mitchell, Anna Kendrick gives the movie a nice outing as Beca. I did notice that her presence is not as felt here near as much it was in the original, but that did not stop me from enjoying the film. Brittany Snow stars as Chloe and does a good job, while Rebel Wilson provides Pitch Perfect 2 with enough humor as she did in the original as Fat Amy. Skyler Astin and Adam DeVine both reprise their roles as Jesse and Bumper respectively, while Hailee Steinfeld debuts as Emily and does a nice job.In regards to the story, Pitch Perfect 2 has a solid amount of humor, drama, and musical bravado. The 2nd act of the movie slows down, and some lines in the movie work, while other lines just don't(or feel too in vein of the original), but Pitch Perfect 2 is a enjoyable film due to the actors/actresses involved, the music, the humor, and the story which has a charming 3rd act. Pitch Perfect 2 may not be exactly great, but I still enjoyed Elizabeth Banks directorial debut which is why Pitch Perfect 2 isA Good ExperienceRated PG-13","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D23R0XVN1769/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC3SG4#wasThisHelpful","R1D23R0XVN1769","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited when Brad Bird announced that the next film he would be working on would be none other than a sequel to The Incredibles. Critics have not been too kind to this movie; which admittedly had me skeptical about seeing it. Nonetheless, I did finally get to see it  and today, I give my review on the movie Tomorrowland.Young but bright Frank Walker is on his way to the Hall of Inventions to demonstrate a jetpack that he built. Upon meeting David Nix, Frank informs David that his jetpack does not exactly work; all the while capturing the interest of a young girl Athena. Later, Athena gives Frank a strange pin-a pin that sends Frank to a place of his wildest dreams.Starring as Frank Walker, George Clooney gives Tomorrowland a likable performance alongside Britt Robertson who portrays the main character Casey. I found myself really enjoying Raffey Cassidy's outing as the character Athena due to how well she played the character. Tim McGraw plays Casey's father Eddie in a supporting role, and actor Hugh Laurie stars as David Nix.Tomorrowland's story is easy to follow, as it has action, comedy, science fiction, and adventure. Visually, the movie is gorgeous to look at and I like the movie's soundscape as a whole. There are times in the 3rd act of the film where the plot gets a bit muddled, but I still was able to enjoy the movie nonetheless. Surprisingly, Tomorrowland has a bit more profane words than the average PG movie does, which may or may not bother parents. I do not consider this movie to be a highlight or Disney masterpiece, but I will say that Tomorrowland is a good outing due to the actors/actress involved, the likable story, and the visual art of the film. Tomorrowland is:A Good ExperienceRated PG","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCYEM6KDKRJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8OLG#wasThisHelpful","RNCYEM6KDKRJJ","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not too often do you come across a tv show that is compelling and has strong acting. In my review of True Detective, we will take a look into the highly acclaimed series.In the first episode, Detectives Marty Hart and Rustin Cohle are on a case that involves a woman by the name of Dora Lange who has been mysteriously murdered. Upon further investigation, they notice her body is tied to a tree in a kneeling position with deer antlers on her head. Years later, Marty and Rust are both being questioned due to the recent killing of similar circumstances and because Detective Gilbough and Detective Papania still believe the real killer is still around.By now, you may be wondering: ""Why is this show getting so much praise?"" Well it starts first with the actors/actresses. Matthew McConaughey is simply terrific in his role as Rustin Cohle. He is an elite thinker with a sort of worldly view on just about everything; but he is also a skilled detective. You want a straight answer from Rust Cohle well.....you better ask the right question. Woody Harrelson stars as Marty Hart and does a fantastic job. Rust and Marty may not be exactly alike(especially in terms of personality) but when they do put their heads together, the duo is unstoppable. Michelle Monaghan plays Marty's wife Maggie, while Michael Potts and Tory Kittles star as Detectives Gilbough and Papania respectively. Great Job by the cast.I definitely enjoyed the story of the show. True Detective transitions between different years throughout the entirety of its 8 episode arc, but that only makes the show that much better. I even found myself paying close attention to clues or what a certain character said in certain epsiodes; to get a better understanding of the mystery that needs solving. Even when I thought I knew what would happen next, True Detective surprised me even further by keeping the suspense high and having a slow buildup as opposed to revealing everything at once. There are funny moments, but there were a few times too where I found myself tearing up which I credit the writers wholeheartedly. True Detective rewards viewers with the stellar acting, the wrting of Nic Pizzolatto, the film locations, and because True Detective achieves so much in its 8 episode run.True Detective is not just one of the best shows HBO has put out, it IS one of the best series debuts I have seen. My only hope is that season 2 is just as great or even better than the first.Episode 1: 9.7/10Episode 2: 9.75/10Episode 3: 9.8/10Episode 4: 9.8/10Episode 5: 9.6/10Episode 6: 9.7/10Episode 7: 9.6/10Episode 8: 9.75/10True Detective Season 2: June 21, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7Y9JHUXLYRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUCF420#wasThisHelpful","RF7Y9JHUXLYRL","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really did not know what to think about Pitch Perfect when it was first released. At the time, I just could not bring myself to watch it. I honestly expected to dislike this movie, but my review of Pitch Perfect will detail why I enjoy this movie.After settling in to her new dorm room at Barden University, Beca ventures around her campus and soon comes across two girls Aubrey and Chloe who are recruiting for their A capella group. As it turns out, Beca has a lovely voice; and despites Aubrey's initial disapproval, they allow Beca into the Barden Bellas and so begins Pitch Perfect.Anna Kendrick shines as Beca in Pitch Perfect. Beca has an amazing vocal range, but she is also this sort of reserved person with an interest as a DJ. Brittany Snow stars as Chloe alongside Anna Camp who plays the little TOO overzealous leader of the Bellas, Aubrey respectively. Rebel Wilson is absolutely hilarious in her turn as Fat Amy, While Skylar Astin portrays Jesse and does a good job.Musical numbers are present, but Pitch Perfect benefits from having both a cohesive plot and likable characters. I like how the movie balances humor and still keeps in tune with what it is trying to achieve. I will say that once the 3rd act starts, you can kind of tell what will happen, but even still, Pitch Perfect is a fun film due to the acting, the music, and the story. I will be seeing the already released sequel so expect a review soon. And to close, Pitch Perfect isA Very Good ExperienceRated PG-13","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEB62Q527Q72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APUYWYA#wasThisHelpful","R2GEB62Q527Q72","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie has had numerous critical acclaim from both audiences and critics alike, and I finally have gotten the opportunity to see the film Ex Machina.As Ex Machina opens, we see a guy by the name of Caleb who works as a computer coder. Caleb soon realizes he has won the chance to meet the company CEO and stay at the CEO's house. After meeting the CEO Nathan, Caleb soon meets Nathan's new creation ""Ava""; which soon after Nathan informs Caleb that he wants Caleb to participate in the Turing Test. But after a conversation between ""Ava"" and Caleb, Caleb realizes there is more to Nathan than meets the eye.I enjoyed Ex Machina a great deal, largely in part due to the actors/actresses. Actor Oscar Isaac is easily joining the list of my favorite actors, and in Ex Machina he does a wonderful job. I have been impressed with how well Isaac is able to quickly immerse himself into character and he does so as Nathan during the movie. Domhnall Gleeson stars as Caleb and does an equally impressive job; one thing I took notice of was how balanced and how the character interactions in Ex Machina all make sense. And I will be definitely checking out more of Alicia Vikander's movies, due to how well she portrays the character ""Ava"" in the movie. I definitely feel she is the movie's key character and she gives Ex Machina a soul and purpose.The story progresses as it should; there are not a lot of action sequences mind you, but Ex Machina still keeps the viewer's attention throughout its runtime. I do hope this movie receives more attention; because Ex Machina is a terrific outing due to the acting (notably Isaac, Vikander, and Gleeson), and the intrigue and suspense of the story. Ex Machina isA Great ExperienceRated R","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35T3BA3BQQ9IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI057M0#wasThisHelpful","R35T3BA3BQQ9IW","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah May. The beginning of warmer weather and much to my excitement, the start of summer movies. And as I look forward to movies like Jurassic World, Southpaw, Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Fantastic Four, and many more, today is a day I will not soon forget. Today was a great day due not only to me being off work, but to the unforgettable experience I had with Mad Max Fury Road.After becoming prisoner to a group known as the War Boys, we see Max not only being held captive but being a donor of sorts to Nux. Later, we see a lady by the name of Furiosa who is tasked with transporting an enormous truck for collecting gas. All seems to go as planned until Furiosa decides to take a different route, and their Leader Immortan Joe comes to the realization that his companions are missing.I am a huge fan of the Mad Max series, I even hold Mad Max 2 in regard as one of the best sequels ever. And though it has been many years since the last Mad Max film, Mad Max Fury Road stays true to the series's original roots(while adding some new surprises) and George Miller proves that he still has a gorgeous vision as a director. To start out, actor Tom Hardy stars as Max Rockatansky and I like what he does as the character. Where I see Hardy differs in retrospect to Mel Gibson's  interpretation of Max is that Hardy's Max is a lot more vocal as opposed to Gibson's; Gibson's Max wasn't always as talkative as Hardy's version of Max. Hardy's Max is also equally as cunning and as ruthless as they come which is likable as well. That being said, it is hard for me to choose who I like playing Max more: Gibson or Hardy; honestly I like them both. Nicholas Hoult stars as Nux and I enjoyed his character just as much as I enjoyed actor Hugh Keays-Byrne(see the original Mad Max) starring as the antagonist Immortan Joe. But most impressive throughout the entire movie is Charlize Theron's engaging turn as Furiosa. She kicks an insane amount of butt in Mad Max Fury Road, but her character has a heart and ultimately, Furiosa feels necessary to the drama and progression of the story. Fantastic job by the cast.You would think that with the movie containing such intense action that it would forget to have a cohesive plot. Impressively, Mad Max Fury Road has a narrative that is easy to follow and is still able to deliver in terms of action. Even more surprisingly, Mad Max Fury Road contains a few quick but tender emotional moments.In Terms of action, Mad Max Fury Road gets nothing but complete applause and acclaim from me. I was amazed at not only how over-the-top and completely crazy the action was, but how beautifully choreographed the stunts were. And finally, Mad Max Fury Road is an Amazing film due to the acting(especially Charlize Theron), the story, the direction of George Miller, and the action scenes. I would definitely love to see the series go further, and with Tom Hardy being signed on for 3 more sequels, it would appear that Fury Road is not the last we have seen of Max Rockatansky.I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Once Mad Max Fury Road was over and I left the theater, I could not help but smile and say aloud ""What a lovely day!"" This is seriously the most fun I have had as a moviegoer in quite awhile! And If Mad Max Fury Road is any indication of how well summer movies are going to turn out, then audiences everywhere are in for a joyous time at the movies this summer. I need not go any further than to say GO SEE Mad Max Fury Road because it is without questionA GREAT EXPERIENCERated RNote: I simply can not continue to thank everyone who reads my reviews for the continued support. It still comes as a surprise just how far I have come; writing mere words of excitement in my very first Amazon review of The Dark Knight Rises, to over two years later allowing my love for entertainment to continue to be shared on Amazon. My passion for film, and providing all of you with a detailed review is why I am still here. And to all that have read my reviews I say, have a great summer and thank you so very much for all the love/support.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XCL0KG6EBRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOXDXV8#wasThisHelpful","R10XCL0KG6EBRJ","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Will Smith is a favorite actor of mine and has been for many years. It has been quite awhile since the audience has last seen Will Smith on screen as a lead, but he shows us why there's a science to getting people to trust you in the movie Focus.While at a restaurant, Nicky takes notice of Jess who is at the moment in the company of a very drunk individual. She comes over to Nicky's table and suddenly asks Nicky to pretend to be her boyfriend. They strike up a conversation and immediately Jess invites Nicky upstairs to hotel room. Just as things are about to get steamy, Jess's ""husband"" bursts in and claims he will shoot Nicky; too which Nicky replies that he has cancer. After Jess figures out that Nicky realizes what is really going on here, she later meets up with Nicky wanting him to teach her his skill. But there is so much more to being a con man.Will Smith does a fantastic job in his role as Nicky. He is cunningly clever and easily maneuvers his way in and out of schemes like there's nothing to it. His performance in this movie is a reminder of the Will Smith I enjoy watching in his movies. Great job. The Gorgeous and talented Margot Robbie does a nice job portraying Jess throughout the course of the movie. Jess is a fast learner, and she and Nicky begin to develop an attraction towards each other. And in terms of chemistry, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are ELECTRIC together on-screen. Rodrigo Santoro plays Garriga and does a good job, while Adrian Martinez stars in a supporting role as Farhad and does a really nice job.In terms of story there were a FEW times where the script felt uneven, but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie. The music that this movie has is also really likable. Each scene that has music playing in the background fits in really well with the scene it was being played during. Focus is not a slow movie by any means, but it is a good movie due to the lead actors (and chemistry between Will Smith and Margot Robbie), the humor, the surprises, and the quick change of scenery . And  with all this being said, I consider the movie Focus to beA Good ExperienceRated RStarring: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Rodrigo Santoro, BD Wong, Gerald McRaney, Brennan Brown,","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YT8SWN623PND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2TAXGK#wasThisHelpful","R1YT8SWN623PND","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I start, I want you all to know that not only am I a fan of District 9, I am a big fan of Neill Blomkamp as a director. I am also a fan of actor (and Blomkamp's frequent collaborator) Sharlto Copley. And with that being said, here is my review on the movie Chappie.Deon Wilson works for a weapon manufacturing company by the name of Tetravaal; Deon creates robots that are used as for law enforcement. Deon later asks his boss Michelle Bradley to use an A.I. he created on one of the non-active robots, but she refuses to allow it. Deon steals the non-active robot and it would seem that his plans are about to come into play, until he is robbed by trio of gang members. They quickly make Deon activate the robot which he does, and so begins the movie Chappie.Dev Patel stars in Chappie as Deon and does a really nice job. I like the quirky but eager mindset he embodies in the character. He goes through thick and thin(you'll see in the movie) for Chappie's well-being and he gives the movie a wonderful performance. Sigourney Weaver stars in a supporting role as Michelle Bradley and does a good job. Hugh Jackman plays Vincent Moore, a guy who is also eager, but also has a habit for doing things he shouldn't. As Chappie's primary antagonist, I feel he did really well for the most part but I can not help wondering(Which I'll speak on in a minute) if maybe he was not as imposing or as menacing as he should have been. Sharlto Copley portrays Chappie and he is impressive to watch. I like his transition from being innocent to coming into his own as a robot.What else did I like in the movie Chappie? The effects and action scenes are exciting. The visuals, Chappie's movements and the sound are also successful. However, the story in Chappie is a topic for discussion. Chappie did not ever cause me to be bored nor did I hate the film at all once it was over, but the movie does have pacing issues at times.  There are some scenes that are supposed to hit your emotions (and I'll admit some of them do) but some of those scenes happened too quickly for you to feel much of anything. Hugh Jackman's performance was good, and it was interesting to see him play a bad guy for a change, but his character feels more like a bully than a villain. But despite all this, Chappie still is a good film, due to the acting (primarily Sharlto Copley and Dev Patel), the action, the themes in the story, and the direction of Neill Blomkamp.Overall, I enjoyed Chappie for the most part. It has some issues and will not be considered Neill Blomkamp's finest work, but I still consider Chappie to beA Good ExperienceRated RStarring: Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, Yolandi Visser, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Watkin Tudor Jones,","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MHNI8GREZUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC9SOKW#wasThisHelpful","R4MHNI8GREZUO","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll be honest, I have both Taken and Taken 2 in my collection. I did not really see a need for a 3rd, but we all know movie studios (namely Fox) capitalize off of a franchise they see to be successful. And that being said we have the movie Tak3n.Tak3n brings back Bryan Mills who again is trying to live a normal life. Bryan's ex-wife Lenore is having second thoughts about her current marriage to Stuart-and beginning to rekindle her feelings toward Bryan. After Bryan later receives a text from Lenore requesting to meet at his place to bring bagels, Bryan buys the bagels and arrives home; but what he arrives home to is something not even he saw coming.Liam Neeson is fantastic once again as the character Bryan Mills. Possessing both uncanny intelligence and elite fighting skills, he shows an unstoppable determination to solve the mystery of the movie. Maggie Grace does a great job too as his daughter Kim-which in all the movies, I think the bond they share gives these movies a more emphatic vibe; a man going high and low to ensure the safety of the people he cares most about.  Famke Janssen returns as Lenore and does a good job, while Dougray Scott plays her ever so insecure husband Stuart. And Forest Whitaker does a Really nice job playing Inspector Franck Dotzler.  He's not as easily fooled as the other cops in the movie are,  and he and Bryan go back and forth with each other in terms of who's telling the truth and who isn't.The action in the movie is similar to the action scenes in the others, but there are still a few more explosions and surprises to be had in the movie. The story  progresses  mostly as it should; BUT at a point in the movie I kept telling myself things are becoming a little too predictable which is not exciting for a movie of this caliber.  Sometimes the lines  an actor says just feels like it can be a bit too much/'unnecessary  for the type movie this is. Then too, the primary villain just is uninteresting and  does not look exactly threatening. Even so, Taken 3 or (Tak3n if you prefer) manages to still be a worthy successor to the 2nd movie even if it's not better than the first; due to the lead actors/actresses, the action sequences, and the different direction of the (not entirely satisfying) but still good story.All this being said, while Taken 3(or Tak3n if you prefer) is nowhere near the quality of the 2008 film, my sincere hope is that you enjoy it because Taken 3 isAn Above Average ExperienceRated PG-13Starring: Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, Forest Whitaker, Dougray Scott , Leland Orser, Sam Spruell,","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWE4BB60QBK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0WY46O#wasThisHelpful","R3QWE4BB60QBK1","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this movie twice last summer and as soon as the movie released on blu ray, I almost immediately went out and purchased the blu ray movie How To Train Your Dragon 2. So why is this movie getting so much acclaim? Lets find out.A tournament of sorts is being held with dragon riders and their dragons. Stoick takes notice that his son Hiccup and Hiccup's dragon Toothless are missing from all the fun. Astrid later finds Hiccup and he tells her of the pressure he feels due to his coming of age and the expectations placed upon him. They soon meet Eret a dragon trapper when he explains that the dragons aren't for him, but a mysterious man by the name of Drago Bludvist. Later while flying Toothless, Hiccup gets intercepted by another dragon rider who happens to be a woman named Valka and as it turns out, there is more to Valka than meets the eye.Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup for a second time and does an amazing job in his role. I like the fun-loving relationship he has with Toothless which provides How To Train Your Dragon 2 with some extremely funny, and even some touching moments. Hiccup's bravery makes up for his own uncertainty, and alongside Toothless they keep this movie on the right track. Gerard Butler also returns voicing Stoick the leader of the Vikings and does a very good job. Cate Blanchett does really well in her role as Valka; she has great chemistry alongside Baruchel's Hiccup and Butler's Stoick. And you have to admire her passion for the dragons. Djimon Hounsou stars as the villain Drago Bludvist and does a really nice job.I feel the story in How To Train Your Dragon 2 is significantly better than the first movie. There is a lot of humor, but I love how How To Train Your Dragon 2 pays attention to detail very well. It doesn't leave one scene hanging, nor does it ever feel like too much is being done at once. And that being said, How To Train Your Dragon 2 does have some emotional moments (yes I did cry) that make the movie even better. Animation wise, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a gorgeous feat to watch. Every detail, whether its the dragons, Hiccup's facial expressions, or even the scenes involving ice, is definitely beautiful to see. And if reassurance was ever needed, then I would say that How To Train Your Dragon 2 succeeds Perfectly due to the spectacular animation, the pace and detail of the story, the well done voice acting, and because dragons are so much fun!I enjoy this movie each time I watch and I definitely can not wait to see it again. I will be keeping a close eye on tomorrow's Oscars (mainly because I want to see which movie will win Best Animated Feature). The audience will have to be patient for the 3rd sequel but in the meantime enjoy How To Train Your Dragon 2 to the fullest because it is indeedA GREAT ExperienceRated PGStarring Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, Djimon Hounsou, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, America Ferrera, Kit Harrington, T.J.

"Whether it was Plankton trying to steal the secret Krabby patty formula, Spongebob and Patrick deciding to go alien hunting in Sandy's rocket, Or Spongebob singing the Campfire song, I have definitely seen more than my fair share of Spongebob episodes. And today I finally saw the movie, The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.As the movie begins to unfold, we see Plankton who is at the moment using many different tools to try and once again get his hands on the Krabby patty secret formula. Using a penny, Plankton manages to ease his way into Mr. Krabs's safe and it would appear that Plankton has finally gotten what he has been so desperately trying to get. Spongebob manages to walk in just in the nick of time, and a tug of war ensues for possession of the formula until something mysterious happens to the formula. Things quickly go from bad to worse-and in the most unlikely of events, Spongebob and Plankton must team up in order to rescue the Krabby patty formula.The original cast members consisting of: Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Doug Lawrence, and Carolyn Lawrence voice Spongebob, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, Squidward, Plankton, and Sandy and provide the audience with laughs and succeed at reminding fans why the show is so popular in the first place. Antonio Banderas stars as  Burger Beard a pirate who just so happens to have his own restaurant and does a nice job.In terms of design, the animators also are successful at giving  The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water its signature underwater look, but even the above water or(live-action) scenes play out very well. I do admire the story's themes and lesson about teamwork which I feel the story is an area The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water excels at. Not once did I get bored during the movie's duration; and The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is a good movie due to the humor, the likable theme of the story, and the detail in the scenes (above and underwater).

"Matthew Vaughn directed the 2010 movie Kick Ass as well as the 2011 movie X-Men First Class. And ever since then, he has been one of my favorite movie directors. The movie trailer for Kingsman was released earlier last year (which it was supposed to release in theaters October of last  year but the movie got delayed to release for February). As a result, my anticipation for this movie continued to build, and finally I had the opportunity to see the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service.Many years after the death of his father, Eggsy is currently being held at a police station as the result of stealing and crashing a car that belonged to another guy who had threatened to start a fight at a bar Eggsy and his friends were at. Upon Eggsy's request to use his allowed one phone call, he remembers the medal that was given to him by Harry Hart. After Eggsy is released he meets Harry and little does Eggsy know, his whole life is about to change.Taron Egerton is not an actor I am familiar with, but he is excellent here as Eggsy. He balances his role as teenager with wit and likable courage and is a nice fit in the role. Colin Firth stars as Harry Hart and does a VERY nice job. Whether its trading one liners with Samuel L. Jackson's character Richmond Valentine, or packing a powerful punch, or single-handedly firing a fast but perfectly aimed shot, he provides Kingsman The Secret Service with an all-around entertaining performance. Samuel L. Jackson plays the antagonist Richmond Valentine and does a great job bringing his usual humor; while portraying the character with a lisp tone of voice. Mark Strong also does a great job as Merlin the head of Kingsman training, he's more of a behind the scenes(but still is in control) type character. Sofia Boutella portrays Gazelle and does a fantastic job in her action scenes. Great job here by the cast.Kingsman: The Secret Service has a action packed story that also boasts a few quick, but sweet moments in the movie. In terms of action, the fight scenes are eye-popping due to the action scenes being wonderfully choreographed. Kingsman: The Secret Service is at times over the top, and does have some profanity, but Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a great movie because it knows that it is a movie and never forgets to be a movie. The acting, the story, the action, and the fun I had with Kingsman: The Secret Service is why I would encourage you to GO SEE Kingsman: The Secret Service because it isA GREAT ExperienceRated RStarring: Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Mark Hamill, Sofia Boutella,  Samuel L.

"Jake Gyllenhaal has been an actor on my list of actors to look out for for quite some time now. Not only can he act, but I feel he chooses some of the more unique roles Hollywood has to offer. With movies like Donnie Darko, The Day After Tomorrow, Enemy, and even Prisoners, Jake Gyllenhaal takes an even more surprising turn in the movie Nightcrawler.After trying to sale stolen copper wire, Louis Bloom encounters a cop which is where things begin to take an unfortunate turn. Later, Louis sees a few guys who are recording while the police are trying to pull people from a burning car. Seeing this as an opportunity for himself, Louis manages to get in store credit from a nearby pawn shop owner which is where Louis gets a camera of his own. And after acquiring his own shots from a recent homicide due to carjacking, Louis goes to Channel 6 news which is where he meets Nina the director of the news. And so begins Nightcrawler.Jake Gyllenhaal (who lost 30 pounds in preparation for his role) gives Nightcrawler a shocking but almost sinister turn in his role as Louis Bloom. Louis is conniving and especially deceptive, so much to the point that his character almost makes you uncomfortable. He possesses an uncanny intelligence, and while you won't always be quite sure if he's somewhat sane or just plain psychotic, he will persuade you to do what he asks of you-by any means necessary, while later in the movie he explains exactly why he is the way he is. An amazing job by Jake Gyllenhaal. Also impressive here is Rene Russo in her role as Nina. Her character has a vulnerable side but she still has a firm presence in the movie. Bill Paxson stars here in a supporting role as Joe a fellow cameraman and does a nice job. Riz Ahmed plays Rick and does exceptionally well alongside Jake Gyllenhaal.In terms of story, Nightcrawler manages to keep your attention in a very good way throughout its alloted screen time. Nightcrawler is even better with the detail in the crime scenes which is why I would definitely give credit to how well the movie is shot. I also like the interaction between the characters in Nightcrawler, and the unpredictability of the story which is also likable.But even more so, Nightcrawler is a very good movie due to the all star cast (the highlight being Jake Gyllenhaal's GREAT performance), the pacing and detail of the script, and the fact that it never fails to keep your attention.I am glad to see this movie nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, but I would most certainly have like to seen(and expected) Jake Gyllenhaal nominated for his performance in the movie. I did see a lot of movies last year and definitely consider Nightcrawler one of the better movies 2014 had to offer. All this being said I consider the movie Nightcrawler to beA Very Good ExperienceRated RStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Bill Paxson, Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, Ann Cusack,","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106BI5HF4WQUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3DMJZW#wasThisHelpful","R106BI5HF4WQUL","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW! I regret missing this movie in theaters. Not only that, I am shocked that this movie was snubbed completely from movie awards consideration. Here is my review for Get On Up.At the age of 17 James Brown is currently in prison due to the theft of a suit. James soon meets Bobby Byrd who just so happens to have similar talent like James Brown. Bobby later gets released and convinces his mother to allow James to stay with their family. James later meets Little Richard who after witnessing James' talent, gives him the details on how to make it big. And so begins the movie Get On Up.If Chadwick Boseman impressed me in the 2013 film 42, he IS Even more impressive here as the iconic James Brown. SERIOUSLY. Not only does he play James Brown as a musician, he plays James Brown with such a headstrong, forward presence which is one reason his performance is very likable. Chadwick's dedication, and embodiment are most definitely evident; and his very performance alone is one of Get On Up's highlights. Fantastic job. Viola Davis plays Susie Brown and does a nice job; the scenes she has with James(both when he was younger/older) are some of Get On Up's more emotion ridden scenes. Nelsan Ellis stars as Bobby and does a really nice job, while Brandon Mychal Smith makes the most of his screen time and does an exceptionally great job playing Little Richard. Great Job by the cast.Get On Up is 2 hours and 19 minutes, but not once did I mind the length of the movie. In terms of story, I like the series of flashbacks and how Get On Up shows James Brown's success, his shortcomings, and lifestyle. I especially like the makeup/hair designs in the movie which you begin to notice(especially towards the movie's climax) just how much effort went into making Chadwick Boseman look like James Brown. Not only do the musical numbers fit into the movie perfectly, but Chadwick Boseman is able to pull off James Brown-esque dancing style, his walk, and his dialect, which makes the movie even better. Get On Up is a wonderful film due to the performances (primarily Chadwick Boseman), the dramatic but always entertaining scope of the story, and the music this movie has.I am very surprised that Chadwick Boseman(along with Jake Gyllenhaal, Tom Hardy, David Oyelowo, and a few others) were snubbed or not recognized as I feel they should be. Nonetheless, I definitely consider the movie Get On Up to be:A Great ExperienceRated PG-13Starring: Chadwick Boseman, Craig Robinson, Viola Davis, Tika Sumpter, Octavia Spencer, Lennie James, Jill Scott, Brandon Mychal Smith,","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKKWZCGPYN4AU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBNWAPW#wasThisHelpful","RKKWZCGPYN4AU","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first saw the movie Warrior, I enjoyed the movie to the fullest extent; mainly due to Tom Hardy's performance in the movie. From his turn as the infamous Charles Bronson in the movie Bronson to his promise to make the fire rise as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, I definitely consider Tom Hardy to be one of this generation's actors to watch for. Alongside the great James Gandolfini, Tom Hardy stars in the movie The Drop.Bob works at a bar owned by his cousin Marv, but they also make exchanges or ""drops"" (if you prefer). One night while on his way home, Bob happens to notice a whimpering sort of sound in a garbage can-which is revealed to be a small puppy. He ends up meeting Nadia who keeps the puppy for a few days. Later, things take an unexpected turn as a robbery ensues inside the bar; Bob and Marv both being present and later receive a warning made by a certain mob boss to Marv that he in fact has to retrieve the money.Tom Hardy is a brooding, completely absorbing presence in his role as Bob. Tom Hardy's style for getting into character for his movies is truly amazing. The way his character Bob talks, moves, and even how Hardy changed his accent for the role exemplifies how well he does playing the character. Just when you think you know Bob-you find out(especially towards the end) who and what he is. Equally impressive is James Gandolfini as Marv. The scenes he shares with Bob are some of the movie's best scenes; and I like the turn his character takes in the movie, which adds to the already present suspense in the film. Noomi Rapace stars as Nadia and she does a nice job for the most part-even though there were times I couldn't help feeling her character leaves more to be desired. Nonetheless, the cast in this movie does very well.The Drop is considered to be a crime drama, which in my opinion describes the movie perfect. The Drop may not have very much to offer in terms of action, but The Drop IS an exceptionally crafted movie due to the likable pace, a nicely scripted story, and unique performances by both Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini.This movie is on my list of (2014 movies that deserve more attention) because I do consider The Drop one of the better movies that 2014 had to offer. My final thought on the movie The Drop is that it isA Very Good ExperienceRated RStarring: Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, John Ortiz, Michael Aronov, Noomi Rapace, Michael Esper,RIP James Gandolfini","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGVJE74ZD3J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UQ038#wasThisHelpful","RXGVJE74ZD3J5","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw the trailer for A Most Violent Year back in October, but despite being continuously released in other cities, it didn't release in my town until just yesterday. My thoughts on A Most Violent Year.Abel Morales(our main character), is set to make a 30 day agreement of sorts with a group of men in order to pay these men a set amount of money. Abel and his wife Anna along with their 3 kids later settle in a luxurious home all the while the suspicions of  attorney Lawrence grow, and Abel's oil company having to deal with sudden turmoils.The character of Abel is played ever so smoothly by Oscar Isaac. He is very Al Pacino like in his suave but sharp portrayal as the character. In some of A Most Violent Year's more dramatic moments, Isaac brings a emphatic range necessary to the character; like instances when he feels betrayed or he needs to get his point across. Great job and I hope to see him in future movies. Jessica Chastain stars here as Abel's wife Anna and does a great job playing his wife as well as stepping in when she feels the need to do so. The way she is characterized is exactly how I pictured her character being portrayed-she's not weak at all-she's more of a I'm tougher/smarter than you think I am type character. David Oyelowo plays Lawrence and does a good job though I can't help wondering if his character could have been more vocal at times. Elyes Gabel stars as Julian and does Really well in the movie.Another area, being the movie's design in terms of hair/makeup, costumes, and filming location were nicely set up which gives the movie a gritty feel.A Most Violent Year has me admittedly divided in terms of story. For the most part, A Most Violent Year does what it needs to do in terms of story. There are the occasional action moments and a lot of the scenes are intense. Then too, A Most Violent Year succeeds at telling a story of crime, corruption, and betrayal. But with a movie titled A Most Violent Year you would think that the stakes would be higher or there would be MORE danger, but it does not always feel that way when watching the movie.  Even still, A Most Violent Year manages to capitalize with the actors involved, the dramatic undertone,and the slow buildup of the first part accompanied by the more intense drama of the 2nd and final act.And while A Most Violent Year is not a 5 star movie it still isA Good ExperienceRated.

"Marvel as a whole, has done a lot of great things over the past couple of years. From Thor, Iron Man, even last year's Guardians of the Galaxy. I have a selective list of tv shows I watch, but it is safe to say that Marvel/ABC have a another hit with the show Agent Carter.Set in the 1940s, Agent Carter lives with her roommate, while working for the SSR-that is(Strategic Scientific Reserve). After her friend Howard Stark is accused of selling weapons to the wrong people, Peggy has to great lengths to try and prove Howard's innocence with the assistance of Howard's butler, Edwin Jarvis.I admit I was skeptical going in, but after watching the show's 2 hour premiere, I was exceptionally pleased. Hayley Atwell is Very gorgeous and extremely skillful in her role as Agent Carter. She is not a damsel in distress character (which she occasionally reminds Jarvis in a nice way) but she definitely is resourceful, skilled at combat, and talented in the art of disguise. James D'Arcy stars here as Edwin Jarvis and does a nice job, I like the scenes he shares with Agent Carter (although I do wonder just who his wife is). Enver Gjokaj plays the character Daniel Sousa who clearly is infatuated with Agent Carter and does well.I like the direction of the story, only time will tell if the suspense pays off entirely in this 8-episode story arc. With a threats like ""Leviathan"" and Peggy's identity at stake, I was all too reminded of the whole ordeal with Hydra back in Captain America the Winter Soldier. I also REALLY admire the flashback sequences on the show; one in particular did cause me to tear up a bit, which is a firm reminder of how sentimental the Marvel universe is. The combat scenes are nicely choreographed, and once again Hayley Atwell is Great as the show's lead.As the show progresses, I will continue to rate the episodes until Agent Carter's finale. If you are a Marvel fan and a TV viewer, I definitely consider Agent Carter rewarding experience.Episode 1: 8.75/10Episode 2: 8.8/10Episode 3: 8.8/10Episode 4: 8.9/10Episode 5: 8.95/10Episode 6: 9/10Episode 7: 9.25/10Episode 8: 9/10Overall, Agent Carter progressed very well throughout its 8 episode arc. I enjoyed each character, loved the suspense, and obviously the lead performance of Hayley Atwell. Nothing has been confirmed as of yet, but I do think that ABC will give Agent Carter a second season. Hope everyone enjoyed Agent Carter, and until next time!Starring: Hayley Atwell, James D'Arcy, Chad Michael Murray, Lyndsy Fonseca, Dominic Cooper, Shea Whigham,Upcoming Marvel ReleasesDaredevil TV Series-April 10, 2015Avengers Age of Ultron- May 1, 2015Ant-Man-July 17, 2015 (End Phase 2)Phase 3Captain America Civil War-May 6, 2016 NOTE: I am very Excited to see the Civil War storyline on the big screen. Robert Downey Jr. will portray Iron Man, and Chadwick Boseman will debut as Black Panther. CANNOT WAIT!Doctor Strange-November 4, 2016 NOTE: This one I will keep a close eye on as well mainly due to Benedict Cumberbatch being cast, and my interest in the character.Guardians of the Galaxy 2-May 5, 2017New Spider-Man movie-July 28, 2017  NOTE: A lot has happened earlier this month for Marvel with the confirmation that Spider-Man will indeed become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a new movie scheduled for release in July 2017. Nothing is official as of yet, but rumor is that Spider Man will first appear in none other than Captain America Civil War(which would make sense considering Spider-Man plays a vital part in the Civil War storyline) or Doctor Strange. A new actor will take over the role and Sony will still have primary control of the character; however Kevin Fiege will serve as Producer for the 2017 Spider-Man movie. While I would have like to have seen Andrew Garfield continue his portrayal of Spider-Man, I do have faith that Marvel Studios will give fans a definitive-or rather the Spider-Man movie fans/people deserve. So I am definitely excited to see this happen.Thor Ragnarok-November 3, 2017Black Panther-July 6, 2018 NOTE: It has taken a long time to get a Black Panther movie greenlit, but I am excited for many reasons; especially due to Chadwick Boseman being cast.

"I am sad to see my review for Interstellar continue to sit on my computer's saved documents, but unfortunately there is no pre-order link available on Amazon just yet. But to be fair, the ONLY reason I won't say Whiplash IS the best movie of 2014, is because I have not yet seen Birdman, Into the Woods, Selma, American Sniper, and The Imitation Game. So here is why I consider Whiplash to be a top candidate for movie of the year.As the movie opens we see Andrew who clearly is a VERY talented drummer who is drumming like there is no tomorrow. A man by the name of Terence Fletcher notices Andrew and he in fact just so happens the conductor of Schaffer's Musical team. While Terence at first seems to be the conductor from heaven, I will stop here and say, looks can be deceiving.The Cast in Whiplash delivers in a Marvelous way for the movie as a whole. Miles Teller has had my interest for a couple of years due to his prominent roles in The Spectacular Now, Project X,  21 and Over, and his role in the upcoming Fantastic Four movie. But he has the role of a lifetime in Whiplash. Andrew comes across as shy and timid, but his commitment and hard work are factors which Teller embodies EXTREMELY well. J.K. Simmons( who played J Jonah Jameson in the Raimi Spider-Man movies) is Remarkable here as Andrew's instructor Terence Fletcher. He isn't quite the nice guy he initially seems to be; he uses verbally derogatory towards many of his students, but in that he believes that people must be pushed past their limits in order to be successful. And J K Simmons plays the role exceptionally well here.The story progresses in a good way, showing the hardship/benefits of hard work. Andrew goes through quite an ordeal to prove to himself and others that he IS the man for the drums. Whiplash is so well-liked not just for the musical numbers and such, but due to the acting, story, and the direction of this very movie.And while I am surprised that J K Simmons is the lone nominee at this year's Golden Globes, my hope is that the Oscars give Whiplash its much deserved attention. Believe the hype and EVERY positive word said about Whiplash because Whiiplash ISA GREAT EXPERIENCERated RStarring: Miles Teller, J K Simmons, Melissa Benoist, Paul Reiser, Jayson Blair","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVL3DAO0DCB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PT3AUYO#wasThisHelpful","R1KVL3DAO0DCB9","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first look, The IBSound USB flash drive is not exactly big or flashy, but then again it doesn't need to be. Upon opening the device, I took The drive in my hands and observed it. As I turned it on, I immediately noticed a red light. It does include instructions, so you will notice upon reading these instructions that once the light turns blue-every word or sound is going to be recorded. In terms of Playback quality, I found that the IBSound succeeds very well at playing back each recorded session on my laptop. Range quality may or may not be a concern, and while you do not necessarily have to hold the device directly in your hand for perfect quality, I would not suggest burying it deep in the depths of your pockets while recording someone/something.

"This movie has been a movie of my curiosity for quite sometime now. And after a wider release in theaters, I have finally gotten the opportunity to see the movie Foxcatcher.Mark Schultz who is a wrestler, receives a prestigious offer by a wealthy man by the name of John Du Pont to become a part of his wrestling team at John's facility Foxcatcher Farm. After Mark's brother Dave initially declines the offer to join the team, Mark soon learns that everything has price.Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum, and especially Steve Carrell do so much good for this movie. Steve Carrell is absolutely stellar here as John Du Pont. Carrell is known primarily for his comedic antics, but he hands the movie its most intriguing/compelling performance. And if Channing Tatum has been criticized in the past for his acting abilities, he proves here that he IS just the man for the role of Mark Schultz. I admire the level of range Tatum utilizes in the character. Mark Schultz is a character you root for, and I myself felt a sense of empathy towards his character. Mark Ruffalo does a nice job playing Dave Schultz. It is interesting to see Dave be the coach and sort of father like figure in the movie to Mark. Though Sienna Miller was not given a lot to say in the movie, I like her performance as Dave's wife Nancy.Upon hearing that this was in fact a true story, I did numerous bits of research and most notably the real Mark Schultz himself has recently criticized the film's accuracy; while praising Channing Tatum's performance. In my opinion, there were a few times were the movie felt like it did too much in a certain scene; which would be one area where I feel Foxcatcher does only just enough to be good. But even still, those issues did not stop me from enjoying the movie. Foxcatcher's acting is the strongest suit for the movie, and the set designs/filming locations are well suited for Foxcatcher. Foxcatcher may not have exceeded my expectations, but Foxcatcher isA Good ExperienceRated RStarring: Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Steve Carrell, Sienna Miller, Anthony Michael Hall","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29E7KBEMD5GEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2LU906#wasThisHelpful","R29E7KBEMD5GEH","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can not count the number of times I have seen Batman Begins. When the movie first released back in 2005, I did not get the opportunity to see the movie in theatres, but my first time seeing the movie was after opening it on Christmas morning of that year. And not only did Batman Begins stay true to the character, but it provided the audience with an unforgettable experience.After a fight between Bruce Wayne and a couple of fellow prisoners., Bruce meets a certain man ""Henri Ducard"" who knows exactly who Bruce is and offers Bruce a path for Bruce to conquer his fear and become something greater. And as Bruce returns to Gotham, he realizes that as a man, he has vulnerabilities but as a symbol he can not only stand for something, but he can in fact inspire good.Christian Bale gained a great ordeal of muscle mass and read Batman comics for preparation of the character; while he also uses the Keysi fighting technique. All that being said, Bale is able to master the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman exactly as he should. Bruce has this combination of fear and rage, and Bale immerses those characteristics in his portrayal. And that being said it goes to show Christian Bale's full appreciation/understanding of the character. Michael Caine's portrayal as Alfred is very admirable, and I love how he reminds Bruce the importance of his family name. As Jim Gordon, Gary Oldman succeeds at being the character that is one of the few good cops left in Gotham. Morgan Freeman is equally just as sharp and funny as Lucius Fox. Cillian Murphy is an actor I consider underrated/ I wish he were in movies more often. And he completely owns his role as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. What is likable about his performance is the creepy, sarcastic nature he embodies in the character. Liam Neeson plays ""Henri Ducard"" and I LOVE how he portrays the character. ""Henri"" does not view justice the way Bruce does. He believes that through tactics of terror and suffering, the world then can finally become a better place. Katie Holmes plays Bruce's longtime friend and interest Rachel Dawes, and her performance works well.If the acting in Batman Begins deserves heaps of praise, then so does the story. With themes of fear and justice, Batman Begins succeeds in terms of telling us the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman; while still being able to deliver a great movie. The realism of the Nolan Batman movies has been both praised and criticized but that is where these movies(including Batman Begins) feel genuinely different( in a great way).But above all else, Batman Begins is a great movie thanks to acting talent, the brilliance of the story and the brilliance of Christopher Nolan. I definitely consider Batman Begins as one of (if not the best) best origin movies ever made. And for those reasons, Batman Begins isA GREAT ExperienceRated PG-13Starring: Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Gary Oldman,","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQWRR68R50C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JNJV#wasThisHelpful","R3AQWRR68R50C1","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big BIG fan of movies like Mission Impossible and especially the Bourne movies. But it is this movie in particular-this Casino Royale that I feel the need to do a review on.James Bond and his associate, who are sharing earpieces, are focused in on a certain man with a horribly scarred face. After a lengthy(but likable/memorable) chase, Bond is indeed able to ensue the target. Digging through files soon leads Bond to suspicions of a man with an odd eye by the name of Le Chiffre, and the stakes become very high in Casino Royale.Not too often is there a reboot that manages to do everything right. But  as it were, Casino Royale does everything and I do literally mean EVERYTHING exceptionally well. Starting first with Mr. Daniel Craig, he was excellent as 007. He's not only funny at times, but he possesses surprising intelligence/cleverness; combined with a signature style. It is a joy to see how well he immerses into the character throughout the movie.  Judi Dench's portrayal as M is spot on in the movie. And Eva Green  charms the movie with her presence/acting, as Vesper Lynd and I appreciate the way her character was utilized throughout the movie. Mads Mikkelsen plays the primary antagonist Le Chiffre, adding a real sense of smarts to his poker games, and having a bit of an....eye problem.The action sequences are nicely choreographed and I really enjoy(as previously mentioned) the chase scene in Madagascar with Bond and the guy he is pursuing. As with most of the Bond movies, expect to travel across the globe from places like Venice, The Bahamas, and even London. Casino Royale is able to work so well as a movie due to the memorable action, the buildup/suspense of the script, and the terrific acting by the cast. And as my anticipation for the next Bond movie ""Spectre"" continues to build I rate Casino RoyaleA GREAT ExperienceRated PG-13Starring: Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Jeffrey Wright, Judi Dench, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini,","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W97MICFNCI1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQSN7HE#wasThisHelpful","R1W97MICFNCI1I","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A tale of heartbreak, deception, and a woman who has a knack for writing letters/notes that will send your mind into oblivion. And for those very reasons(and more), there is something about the movie Gone Girl......On a July 4th morning, Nick Dune heads out to a bar that is primarily run by Nick's sister Margo. Upon returning to his home, Nick stumbles across some shattered living room furniture; all the while noticing that his wife Amy is missing.The audience is rewarded with a convincing performance by Ben Affleck as Nick. I myself clearly have not appreciated Ben Affleck's talents as an actor, but he plays Nick really well. Perhaps even more rewarding and the show stealer is Rosamund Pike's role as Amy. I have said it once and here I will say it again: Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Amy is no ordinary woman and Pike portrays the sick, crazed nature of the character VERY well. It is no surprise to me that she has been nominated. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris star in supporting roles as lawyer Tanner Bolt, and Harris starring as rich man Desi. I liked both their performances, especially Tyler Perry's.Right from the start, Gone Girl has this dark, chilling vibe and that tone remains consistent throughout the course of the movie. And that is one area where Gone Girl shines as a movie. You never really know what is what or who to trust, and up until a certain point, the movie will try to make you think you know the whole story, right up until the unexpected happens. Gone Girl is in fact a Great adaptation due to the memorable performances, the twists and unbelievable turns of the script, and the ending that will leave you with even more questions.I enjoyed Gone Girl more than I thought I would and I would even go as far to call Gone Girl one of my favorite movies of 2014. I encourage you to definitely give this movie a watch as I will definitely purchase the blu ray when it releases. And I have a new way to rate my reviews for Amazon(which can be seen on my Amazon Public Profile). Gone Girl is the first movie I will rate:A GREAT movieRated RStarring: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Sela Ward, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens,","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVK8H5JRXKLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5996EQ#wasThisHelpful","RSVK8H5JRXKLD","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Johnny Depp (as well as a few other actors) has been one of my favorite actors for many years. But despite his acclaimed Public Enemies performance, his filmography has not been as impressive as it once was. And after my disappointment in last year's The Lone Ranger, I was beginning to lose faith in Johnny Depp as an actor. So naturally when I heard about this year's movie Transcendence, it was released in April as expected, and as I initially expected, got mostly bad reviews. So therefore, I had no interest in the movie. But just a few days ago, I decided to take a chance with the movie. And much to my astonishment, I like Transcendence A LOT more than I thought I would.When we meet Will and Evelyn Caster, Will is at a sort of seminar. He has this idea-this theory behind technology/ AI(artificial intelligence). Not long after a shocking mishap, Will's wife Evelyn decides to take matters into her own hands thus beginning the story of Transcendence.This may not be a highlight in Johnny Depp's career, but I found myself enjoying his performance as Will Caster throughout the course of the movie. It is really fulfilling to see Johnny Depp to transition to character. I admire the intelligence and the mysterious tone he brings to the character of Will. Equally impressive here is Rebecca Hall who portrays Evelyn. In my opinion, she has the better performance of the movie. And the chemistry between these two helps to drive the movie's plot. Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman star as Max and Joseph, and I liked both their performances.The story in Transcendence is what makes this movie so interesting. The 2nd act is occasionally slow, but the intrigue and thought of Transcendence is something that sticks with you. Some have called the plot unfocused and I quote""tries to do more than it should"" but I politely disagree. Transcendence not only left me with the ""what if"" questions and ""you never know"" type thoughts- but the movie itself  makes a serious statement that is ""people fear what they don't understand."" Transcendence works best as a movie due primarily to the acting, the direction, and the thought provoking storyline.I realize that Transcendence has received a great deal of dislike, and I am not saying ""go buy this movie"", but I do consider Transcendence to be a much better movie than some would give it credit for in my opinion. I myself would even call it underrated. Transcendence may not be groundbreaking or the best movie of 2014, but I will say give Transcendence a watch and my sincere hope is that you enjoy it.3.5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Johnny Depp, Paul Bettany, Rebecca Hall, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, Kate Mara,","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIW8JM9276A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6RYVGQ#wasThisHelpful","RXIW8JM9276A5","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first watched The Wolf of Wall Street back in January 2014, I was not quite sure what to make of the movie at the time.  Extremely vulgar, not to mention that there is a high dose of nudity involved, and despite all that-I thoroughly enjoy this movie. What are the odds?After a chance meeting with Mark Hanna, Jordan Belfort decides to take a chance at being a stockbroker. And as it turns out, Jordan is REALLY good at doing this type of work. Later on down the line, Jordan meets a man by the name of Donnie Azoff who tells Jordan that he will in fact quit his job, if Jordan shows him a check stub proving Jordan's income. And after Jordan starts his own firm Stratton Oakmont, it begins a tale of wealth, power, greed, thereby turning Jordan into The Wolf of Wall Street.Leonardo Dicaprio shows here why he is in fact one of the best actors of this generation. He plays Jordan Belfort EXTREMELY well. Jordan is definitely greedy, extremely indifferent and Leonardo's incredible range is put on display in the best way here. Jonah Hill has an  impressive performance here as Donnie, his character is quirky and definitely funny; alongside Leo's character Jordan they both give the audience a worthwhile experience. Margot Robbie is exceptionally good as the character Naomi, I admire her quick immersion of the character-and it will be interesting to see her play Harley Quinn in the 2016 Suicide Squad movie. Kyle Chandler plays the 'I don't like you because you're so rich' (kidding) FBI agent Patrick Denham as does a very nice job. I really enjoy the scene when he and Jordan first meet on Jordan's Yacht. Matthew McConaughey stars as Mark Hanna as delivers a great/memorable supporting performance in his alotted screen time.The story, led by the direction of Martin Scorsese has themes that I feel need to be valued. There is A LOT of inappropriateness in this movie but it shows-or rather demonstrates the pros and ultimately the dire consequences of wealth combined with greed. And I love how The Wolf of Wall Street is able to show Jordan's rise and his inescapable fall. The Wolf of Wall Street is considerably long, but in my opinion it is well worth it.In preparation for last year's Oscars', I had actually predicted Leonardo as my dark horse to win the award-especially with him having won the Golden Globe for his performance. I cannot seem to fathom why the Oscars have failed to give him(along with Will Smith, Gary Oldman, Jake Gyllenhaal, etc.) the award, but perhaps it is best not to steer my review off track. In the end, The Wolf of Wall Street is VERY crude and at times rather satirical. But The Wolf of Wall Street is able to work so well due to the praise worthy performances, the themes of the story, and the dazzling direction of Mr. Scorsese. I would NOT let my kids see this movie but all in all, I rate The Wolf of Wall Street4.5 StarsRated RStarring:Leonardo Dicaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Jon Bernthal, Kyle Chandler, Jon Favreau, Spike Jonze, Jake Hoffman,","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0RF065SZXUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9KKKAY#wasThisHelpful","R3K0RF065SZXUC","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a horrible car accident that involves (dad) Denny, (mom) Kat, (son) Teddy, and (daughter/main character) Mia, Mia seemingly unharmed,  awakens in the cold of the snow to find that she is still at the scene of the accident. After finally realizing the nature of the unfortunate circumstances, Mia must choose between returning to life itself or allowing herself to let go.I am extremely impressed with how well Chloe Moretz's career is turning out. And she is a joy to watch as the character Mia. Mia is not necessarily an outcast type of character, but she is unique, and a talented cello player. Jamie Blackley stars opposite Chloe Moretz as her boyfriend Adam. I like the chemistry they share and the tender moments that are seen with these two throughout the movie. Mirelle Enos(was in World War Z) stars as Mia's cool, but sometimes obnoxious mom and she did good-she reminded me of my mom in a sense. Stacy Keach stars as Mia's grandpa (referred to as ""Gramps"") and I LOVE the scenes he and Mia share. Liana Liberato plays Mia's friend Kim and does well with her role.If I Stay works in a lot of good ways, especially in terms of story; and it did cause me to imagine myself in Mia's situation and I felt for her. And I did cry a couple of times(especially towards the end) because it felt real in a way. There is truly something uncommonly sweet and undeniably heartfelt about this movie. And while If I Stay is not the best adaptation I have seen, I would encourage you to give If I Stay a watch.8/10Rated PG-13Starring : Chloe Moretz, Joshua Leonard, Liana Liberato, Mirelle Enos, Jamie Blackley, Stacy Keach,","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UHFTOMT3AI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OI7JB6A#wasThisHelpful","R10UHFTOMT3AI5","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people I know all are fans of The Matrix and a selective few movies that Keanu Reeves has done. But I think we can agree that movies like 47 Ronin are not some of Keanu's better movies. So naturally I was not expecting big things with the movie John Wick. Not until I began seeing reviews and hearing surprisingly good things about the movie. And so finally, I got around to seeing John Wick and I will say this:  this movie is really GOOD!John Wick has gone through quite an ordeal, having just lost his wife. But something good comes out of his loss, after one day receiving an adorable dog. After politely turning down an offer for his car to a guy who apparently does not like being told no, the guy decides to break into John's house with a couple of goons who (as it seems) have nothing better to do. In the aftermath, they will learn why messing with John Wick was a VERY bad move.John Wick as a movie has so much good going for it. And I read how Keanu Reeves trained Japanese and Brazilian jiu-jitsu which I respect a lot. And as for his take on the character, I think he does really well  in the titular role. He is not an especially suave type of character, but he IS a relentless loose cannon when wronged. And even though he takes a few hits, believe me when I say he can definitely throw down with the best of them. Willem Dafoe stars as the character Marcus and does a good job, Adrienne Palicki takes an evil turn in her role as Ms. Perkins and she does not mess around. Alfie Allen (who plays Theon my fellow Game of Thrones fans) stars as bad guy Iosef and does good at making his character unlikable. And Michael Nyqvistst portrays his evil father Viggo and does a good job.If there is one thing I want to see when it comes to action movies, that is good action sequences. And the fight scenes in John Wick manage to have a good amount of force to them. But what John Wick manages to do even better is have a focused pace, in terms of storyline.I am glad that this movie turned out as good as it did; though one can only wonder if there will be a sequel. Nonetheless, John Wick is a high octane action movie that I say give a watch and I sincerely believe you will enjoy it.4 StarsRated RStarring: Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrienne Palicki, Ian Mcshane,","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T2G1K2KBNTL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV3VGP0#wasThisHelpful","R2T2G1K2KBNTL1","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the Hunger Games series again from start to finish over the summer, and I gotta say I really have developed an even stronger admiration for the series. The same can be said for the two previous movies: The Hunger Games and The Hunger Games Catching Fire respectively. And one of my most anticipated movies of 2014 was none other than Mockingjay Part 1.Time has passed since Katniss sent her arrow flying into the base of the  arena in the 75th Hunger Games. And Katniss is not quite the same person she was. Peeta is a captive of the Capitol, her home District 12 is in ruins, and an offer has been proposed for her to become the new leader, a template to show the President Snow and the Capitol that  she is in fact The Mockingjay.3 is the number that sometimes doesn't work for a movie trilogy but thankfully for The Hunger Games movies, Mockingjay Part 1 DOES. Starting first with Jennifer Lawrence, she once again shines in her role as Katniss; she definitely fulfills the necessary emotions of fear, depression, and resilience throughout the course of the movie. And she does harmonize the ""Hanging Tree"" tune very beautifully. Liam Hemsworth does well in the movie as Gale; going to extreme lengths to keep Katniss happy. This time around, Finnick is a  man who has lost something so precious to his heart,  and Sam Claflin nails it. Josh Hutcherson definitely deserves attention for his role as Peeta in Mockingjay Part 1. He is being tortured and made to tell Katniss and the Districts that no one is safe. And Peeta is assuredly NOT the same boy from the past two movies. Woody Harrelson returns as Haymitch and does a good job. Elizabeth Banks plays Effie Trinkett and does really well, even without all her makeup. And Donald Sutherland's role as President Snow is a lot more effective. He is wicked and determined to destroy Katniss and her Mockingjay image and strip any thought/symbol of hope that people in the districts may have. Julianne Moore plays President Coin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman returns as Plutarch. Characters like Boggs and Cressida were cast well as Mahershala Ali and Natalie Dormer prove in the movie. More importantly, the whole of the cast led by the direction of Francis Lawrence did great.Much like The Hunger Games Catching Fire, I Really appreciate the way the writers were able to script the movie with some things that were in the novel, while also adding a few other pieces to it. The themes in this movie, especially with the whole political conflict and  fight for justice/freedom feel relevant to our times. And if anyone were to ask me if I was ready for the 2nd  part of this finale  I would most certainly say YES I AM.I had sheer enjoyment watching Mockingjay Part 1 today, and while  you wait for Part 2 to release, my final words would be GO SEE Mockingjay Part 1.RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman4.5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Mahershala Ali, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Evan Ross, Stanley Tucci, Jeffrey Wright, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Natalie Dormer,","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCYCI6FZDV9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYLT0OW#wasThisHelpful","RNCYCI6FZDV9H","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not AT ALL planning to do this, however a Best Buy Black Friday deal of $5.99 was too good to pass up. Of the many films I saw this past summer, I did in fact see Transformers Age of Extinction in theaters. And I remember it well, mainly because it was a packed theater and once the movie was finally over, everyone I the audience got up at once. So what is the deal with Transformers Age of Extinction? Lets find out.In our fourth adventure, we meet Cade, his daughter Tessa and Cade's employee Lucas. Cade is a single father/ inventor and it is one particular day while out at an retired theater that he comes across a rusty truck. Seeing it as an opportunity, Cade buys the truck for himself; not knowing that he has in fact found Optimus Prime,  all the while a new threat known as the decepticon Lockdown and his human allies are actively pursuing Prime's location. And so begins Age of Extinction.I promise, I will try my best to not start a rant about how I feel about the Transformers movies in general.  And as with all my reviews lets talk about the good this movie has. Mark Wahlberg was definitely a great addition to this franchise and in my opinion, is one of the main qualities that Age of Extinction possesses. I feel that Cade is a good ally alongside Optimus; the way Cade strategically handles certain instances and the way he is able to convince Optimus to not lose faith in the humans. And on to some of the other human cast, we have Stanley Tucci as Joshua Joyce and I enjoyed his performance equally as well. Kelsey Grammer's role as Harold Attinger is good for the most part, but I feel like his character was underdeveloped and unfinished. He's one of those come and go characters: One minute he's present and then so much goes on and then POOF there he is again. To phrase his performance in my own words would be : Satisfying, but unfinished. Mark Ryan is tasked with voicing Lockdown and I like what he does with the character, he definitely proves a worthy opponent to the Optimus and the autobots. Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime once more, and though Optimus had to endure a lot of ordeals with very little help in Age of Extinction, I admire the way Cullen is able handle voicing the character. Expect to see a angrier more raged filled Optimus this time around. I also liked how John Goodman brought (good) humor  voicing the character Hound.  As expected, the effects and designs of the robots are fantastic, while the movie is also able to boast a good score/music to go along with it. And I do like(as I noticed too with the 3rd movie) how the central focus is slowly shifting from the humans to the robots. And now ladies and gentlemen, lets talk about the bad of Transformers Age of Extinction.Before I start, I want to let you all know that yes, I've heard all the complaints aka (too many explosions, dumb dialogue, Michael Bay is this and that, why does he keep making these movies, etc.) heard all the jokes aka ""Bayformers"", Transplosions, I mean I have heard a lot of bad things in terms of these movies. In retrospect, I can agree with some of the complaints. And the problem with Transformers Age of Extinction is that it has some of the same issues and sadly a few more. With Dark of the Moon, I did not mind the screen time, due to the fact that at the time, I was under the impression that it was to be the last movie in the trilogy. But there is no reason NO REASON AT ALL that this movie HAD to be 164 minutes long NONE. And there are certain moments where you wonder why the hell (sorry) heck that a certain sequence is dragging, or what the point is to a certain line being said-and I point to the screen time. There are times I said to myself if this movie-this Age of Extinction had been 20-30 minutes shorter it would have been A LOT better movie. Speaking on the script, I think there was some positive aspects in terms of writing, but some scenes/moments had me seriously wondering what in the green grass of this Earth Ehren Kruger was thinking. There are some parts that started out being funny and then the joke either goes too far or something stupid happens. WHY? Another thing that bothers me is how it seems that these movies have almost identical setups. What I mean by that is one really REALLY attractive girl, her boyfriend, and a guy that is supposed to be funny but is just stupid and ultimately not necessary and then the robots. Jack Reynor who plays Tessa's boyfriend Shane knows exactly what I am talking about. His acting is so bad that it also made me wonder did the casting department just toss random names in a hat and draw his name out like a sweepstakes. Yeah he IS that bad. I am a big Dinobots fan so naturally when I heard they were going to be in the movie I was excited. But much to dismay they only appear on-screen for a short while. Not Cool. And I don't necessarily despise Michael Bay but I do wonder does he care at all about quality or does he just care about raking in a big paycheck?I won't say that Age of Extinction's good outweighs the bad or vice versa, it ultimately depends on your matter of preference.  If you like these movies just for fun and don't care about the other stuff I just mentioned then you probably won't mind this movie one bit. And quite frankly, I don't have too big problem with Age of Extinction myself, I just dislike some of the things that occur while watching the movie. One other good thing that has me curious about the future of this trilogy is I DID enjoy the climatic scene to the movie. And admist hearing rumors that Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox may return, or Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis may join Transformers 5 all at my disappointment that Mark Wahlberg won't return, I will say that you can give Transformers Age of Extinction a watch, and the rest is for you to decide.6.7/10Rated PG-13Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Kelsey Grammer, Stanley Tucci, Ken Watanabe, Peter Cullen, Sophia Myles, Jack Reynor, Mark Ryan, John Goodman, Nicola Peltz, Li Bingbing,Update: Mark Wahlberg confirmed that he will return for a 5th movie","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19R69N1ZY7CUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4K3MLE#wasThisHelpful","R19R69N1ZY7CUY","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I saw the trailer I simply said ''nope"". The second time I saw the trailer I said ""no still not gonna see this one."" It wasn't until one night watching a tv series I follow closely; the trailer for Dracula Untold showed once again, and after viewing it, I pondered that maybe Dracula Untold might actually turn out to be a decent movie. So finally, I decided oh what the heck, and today I got the opportunity to view the movie. And while I still had some doubt going in, my review of this movie will detail exactly why I feel the way I do about Dracula Untold.Disputes have arisen between Vlad(our main character) and the Turkish armada. Not only are they a threat, but an order has been made that 1,000 boys must be offered to be trained for warfare. Consideration here quickly turns to desperation and soon Vlad comes across a mysterious man in a cave(who is not the nicest looking character in the world) who seems to have a solution to the problem: a sort of immortality. The price? Vlad must resist the urge for human blood in order to not become a full-fledged vampire.Dracula Untold shines for many reasons. Luke Evans shows a lot of charisma and is definitely a stronghold throughout the movie. From his first appearance onscreen, all the way to his transition into the iconic character, he is a feat to watch. Sarah Gadon plays Mirena and does a good job; and I could definitely write a full review about how beautiful she is. Dominic Cooper portrays Mehmed in the movie, while he is not one of the movie's highlight performances I can call his performance satisfactory.The effects/sound in the movie is also one of Dracula Untold strong suits', and the designs of the vampires are likable. Finally, the storyline this movie has is surely a good one. The suspense and the thrill of the first act, all the way to the cliffhanger ending of the final act keeps the movie viewer filled with intrigue, and in the end Dracula Untold is a movie I can definitely say GO SEE. And while I won't call Dracula Untold a 5 star movie I will rate it4 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Luke Evans, Dominic Cooper, Sarah Gadon, Noah Huntley, William Houston, Charlie Dance,","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VZ311B0K2R8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OALBUZY#wasThisHelpful","R3VZ311B0K2R8B","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"November 30, 2013 is a day I and many other people wishes had turned out to have a different outcome. Out of nowhere, I remember distinctively reading articles of Paul Walker's and Roger Rodas's tragic passing due to an unfortunate car accident. I was definitely shocked and admittedly more distraught than I thought I would be, but only because of who Paul Walker is and what he will always be remembered for. I obviously did not know Paul Walker personally, but I consider him to be a friend not just to his on-screen co-stars, but to myself and the millions of people worldwide who loved him. And though I have many other reviews on the way in the coming days/weeks, today is the day I review the movie: Hours.Nolan and his wife Abigail are at their local hospital in New Orleans due to the fact that Abigail is about to give birth to their first child. Danger is lurking in the weather and soon Nolan has the task of making sure that his baby girl receives enough oxygen all the while being trapped in the hospital.The story in this movie is not especially mind blowing, but Hours work so well due to the fact that the set up of the movie itself is structured so well, which in turn gives Hours believable and Paul Walker's earnest performance. As Nolan, his character shows a lot of courage, and is pushed to unthinkable desperation. And Paul Walker gives an altogether good performance in the movie. Speaking on the supporting cast and being that this movie is set in New Orleans, I appreciate the diversity of the cast.Finally, while I do not consider Hours to be a movie of epic proportions nor do I consider this to be Paul Walker's best film, it does prove to be a good outing and a movie Paul Walker's fans should enjoy.3.5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Paul Walker, Nick Gomez, TJ Hassan, Yohance Myles,","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LKFC8G9UEFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8AJ34E#wasThisHelpful","R13LKFC8G9UEFV","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rover is a movie I have been anxious to see for quite some time now. And today my opportunity came and now I will share my thoughts.Years after an event known as The Collapse, We see Eric driving along a mostly empty highway. He soon makes a stop, and suddenly  his car is stolen by three mysterious guys. Determined to find his car's whereabouts, Eric soon stumbles upon Ray who (as luck would have it) just might know where Eric's car might be.The Rover is a good movie for many reasons. The trio consisting of Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson is one of the main reasons The Rover is a good film. Guy Pearce exemplifies a mostly quiet but fearless demeanor in his outing as Eric and it really DOES work for the movie. But perhaps even better than Eric himself, is Robert Pattinson in his role as Ray. Robert Pattinson shows more than skill in The Rover; once again he shows that he CAN in fact really act. Whenever Ray is on screen, I definitely feel a sense of curiosity, and feel very sympathetic towards his character.The story in this movie is good, especially in terms of dramatic buildup and suspense. The tone is depressing, and at times-well most of the time really, The Rover can feel rather empty/lonely. I cannot begin to imagine a practically vacant landscape or terrain with only a few people, which is another thing The Rover manages to pulls off really well.So finally, with fine acting and a intriguing concept to back it up, The Rover proves to be a solid movie to be rated:4 StarsRated RStarring: Guy Pearce, Robert Pattinson, Anthony Hayes, Scoot McNairy, David Field,","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ03RG0MAAWBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7DIK5A#wasThisHelpful","RQ03RG0MAAWBW","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So last year, Warner Bros. and company were successful with the movie Pacific Rim. And this year they released the remake of Godzilla.After an incident gone terribly wrong resulting in the loss of Joe's wife Sandra, Joe is determined to figure out what exactly caused this incident to happen. Many years later, Joe and Sandra's son Ford is thrust into a tight situation; as being a military man and a dad is not always easy. But soon after meeting Dr. Ishiro, Ford and the world will come to know the creature known as Godzilla.The good in Godzilla consists of: Godzilla himself; the design team and visual effects crew deserve  respectable mentions for the overall look of the iconic monster; everytime Godzilla is on screen, you  have to admire the stature and presence that he has. On to the actors, I was surprisingly not impressed with Aaron Taylor Johnson's nor Elizabeth Olsen's performances as Ford and Elle, although I was impressed with Ken Watanabe's performance as Dr. Ishiro and HIGHLY pleased with Bryan Cranston's performance as Joe, which is why I will SERIOUSLY be giving the series Breaking Bad a watch on Netflix in the foreseeable future.There is some fault in this movie. Main fault being the screen time appearance of the titular character. As I previously stated, the scenes that Godzilla is in are good but he does not have enough screen time in the movie. Also, the second act of this movie can sometimes cause impatience due to the viewer getting teased by something big, but only a few times does that something big actually capitalize on that suspense. Fortunately however, the good that this movie does have somehow manages to outweigh the bad. A sequel has been confirmed, and my hope is that Warner Bros./ Legendary Pictures makes some major adjustments for the sequel to be better. Not a great movie, nor is it a movie you must see right away but I will rate Godzilla7.6/10Rated PG-13Starring: Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Richard Jones, CJ Adams,Godzilla 2: June 8, 2018","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2W7JSL3T87Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2CHW48#wasThisHelpful","R2X2W7JSL3T87Q","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are quite a few movies like: Interstellar, Fury, Mockingjay Part 1, and many more that I am looking forward to seeing as the months progress.  Today and today only, I finally got the opportunity to see The Equalizer.Robert McCall is the primary main character here. In the movie, we see that he works at a hardware store, has a nice but notably somewhat empty apartment, and usually spends his nights at a nearby diner. On one of these nights, Robert comes across a girl Teri. They strike up a conversation and a sort of friendship, until one of these nights Terri is revealed to be in the ICU. And so begins, The Equalizer.Denzel Washington is very respectable and a highly intelligent actor. And it shows in The Equalizer.  He has a wonderful outing as Robert McCall. Reminiscent of his roles in Man on Fire and a little bit of Safe House, he brings the dramatic flair and packs some SERIOUS heat in the action sequences. On to Chloe Moretz, she displays amazing range in her acting ability; and does a Great job as Teri.  The supporting cast involved in the film does a nice job, while the character development held to keep the film on the right track.The Equalizer not only has a talented cast, but it also has a well scripted story to back it up. And again, the action scenes are really well choreographed; being that they are very brutal and pretty bloody.By having a successful first and second act and a thrilling third act, The Equalizer is a no-holds barred action packed movie that is very likable and worth the admission. I won't call this the classic that Training Day was back in 2001 with Denzel and director Antoine Fuqua at the helm, but they have not made a bad movie in The Equalizer.

"Aside from Guardians of the Galaxy and this movie and a few others, August was a disappointing month for movies. I had been looking forward to Sin City a Dame to Kill For for years but left the movie theater shaking my head. And just when I had thought that it was about to get even worse, today I finally saw the movie The Giver.If you have read the book by Lois Lowry, Jonas is our main character here. Jonas lives in a futuristic but colorless world surrounded by his friends: Asher and Fiona, and his family who consists of his father, mother, and his sister Lilly. After a public ceremony, Jonas is granted the task of becoming the receiver of memory, thus being paired with none other than The Giver.As a movie, The Giver is more light-hearted than it is intense, but it still proves to have a beautiful theme; especially visionary wise. And Jeff Bridges portrayal as The Giver in the movie is Sharp. He shows all the emotions that The Giver should have; combined with that signature look of depression, anguish, fear and hope. Katie Holmes has a nice outing as Jonas's mother and Alexander Skarsgard does well as Jonas's father. Meryl Streep does a mostly good job as the chief elder, but I can't help feeling maybe she could have done more. And though Brenton Thwaites is not quite the same age as Jonas is in the novel, I like what he does here playing the character. Odeya Rush was lovely in her role as Fiona; while country singer Taylor Swift has minor appearances throughout the film.And despite the story being switched around a little-that is-(some things left out of the book/new things added that were not in the book), The Giver is still a good movie. Am I saying this movie is great? No. Am i saying that this is the best adaptation from book to movie ever? No. I will say that The Giver movie does have some miscues and perks about it but somehow the movie manages to keep your attention the entire movie. And that is why I rate it8.2/10Rated PG-13Starring: Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgard, Katie Holmes, Odeya Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Cameron Monaghan,","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OELM1V5HTQP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU2P0HO#wasThisHelpful","R1OELM1V5HTQP8","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earth is not the quite the same anymore due to a violent outbreak in the Form of  zombies. Columbus,  the main character reminds us(the audience) that in order to survive in this world known only as: Zombieland there are in fact rules  to follow. As we join him on his journey to Columbus, Ohio to hopefully discover his parents, a chance encounter introduces us to Tallahassee. Tallahassee, is in search of the famliar pastry known to mankind as twinkies. While at a grocery store, Columbus and Tallahassee meet Wichita and Little Rock.  And little do Columbus and Tallahassee know, there is more than meets the eye with Wichita and Little Rock.Zombieland is one of those movies I enjoy whole heartedly. As  you may well know  by now I do like to laugh when a movie is funny: whether it is  a comedy or for example, a movie that is not necessarily a comedy, but has funny moments. But above all else, I just enjoy a good/great movie. Zombieland is a movie that succeeds at being funny and being an all around great movie.  For starters, Jesse Eisenberg has a nice outing as Columbus in the film. As Columbus, he is not extremely outgoing but he is in fact cautious.  Columbus executes his list of rules in order to survive. And Woody Harrelson has a nice outing in Zombieland as the (man on a quest for twinkies) Tallahassee. He is responsible for many of the movie's humorous lines; and he plays the character exceptionally well.  Emma Stone has a certain wit with her character Wichita, and  while  I do find her eyes to be beautifully sweet( eh, sorry Andrew Garfield) she and Abbigail Breslin (Little Rock) share believable chemistry as sisters  in the film.I also appreciate the pace this movie has. It is considerably fast yes, but in terms of the movie it is not a bad thing. CGI in general has changed much since this movie was first released; however the makeup on the zombies is likable. And again, Zombieland is funny, but there is enough dramatic flair and gun tooting action in the movie as well.  Zombieland is not one of those movies you watch only at Halloween, Zombieland IS one of those very movies you  can watch again and again and still have a good time with it.To end,  although a sequel was rumored to be happening but has yet to be given the greenlight, remember there are rules to  follow in Zombieland. Like for instance, Cardio. No matter what  car you decide to enter, ALWAYS check the back seat. When shooting a zombie, always remember to double tap(that is-make sure the zombie is Dead). And if you don't do anything else, just remember Rule 32: Enjoy the little things.5 StarsRated RStarring: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone,  Amber Heard, Abbigail Breslin, Bill Murrray","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WY2WY9SNEEF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WY65VU#wasThisHelpful","R1WY2WY9SNEEF7","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The trailers definitely caught my attention. From the mid part of 2013, all the way until this year I was curious about this movie that was to be part of the Marvel world. So this movie, this Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It simply can not be as good as everyone says it is can it? Well as it just so happens, Guardians of the Galaxy IS every bit as great as you should believe.Peter Quill is at a bit of a standoff; because he has taken possession of an orb and Korath and a few of Korath's friends have the means to take the orb to Korath's leader who is called Ronan the Accuser. Later, while trying to pawn off the orb, Peter encounters Gamora, who is under none other than Thanos. That is when we meet Rocket a talking raccoon and Groot a talking tree. After Peter, Rocket, Groot and Gamora are placed in jail, that is where we meet Drax the Destroyer.The things I have to say about Guardians of the Galaxy will only be positive. Chris Pratt was the guy famous for getting knocked out twice by Wesley Gibson in the movie Wanted, but in Guardians of the Galaxy he is awesome as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Funny, bold, and completely inquisitive. Vin Diesel does a great job voicing Groot and makes the character increduloulsy likable. Speaking of likable, Bradley Cooper does a VERY nice job voicing Rocket Raccoon. He only adds more hilarious moments to the film; and the bond he and Groot share is felt(in a good way) throughout the movie. Dave Bautista plays Drax the Destroyer and does a nice job; while Zoe Saldana brings her usual attractive qualities, with a dose of-you better not mess with me because I will fight-attitude in her character Gamora. Djimon Hounsou was convincing as Korath(WHO?) While Lee Pace displays more than enough evil in his role as the antagonist Ronan the Accuser. Michael Rooker also has a nice albeit funny outing as Yondu in this film. And finally, Josh Brolin takes over the role of Thanos and does good with the role. There are a lot of Actors/Actresses in the movie, but each one does his/her job exceedingly well.Marvel must have a great team of screenwriters. Reason I say this is, due to how Guardians of the Galaxy stays right on track throughout its entire runtime. There are numerous humorous moments, as well as memorable action scenes, but above all of that Guardians of the Galaxy has a heart and a purpose. there were in fact, a couple of times were tears began to form in my eyes; which is  strange because I can not recall a superhero movie, (not to mention a team of heroes I am not familiar with) to dig that deep into my emotions. The themes of hope, trust, teamwork, and sacrifice are present throughout Guardians of the Galaxy and for the movie, it definitely works.Among hearing rumors that the Guardians of the Galaxy may make an appearance in Avengers 3 to that I say: MAKE IT HAPPEN. There is a lot of fun and a lot of joy to be had with Guardians of the Galaxy all the way to the very end. Phase 2 is getting better and BETTER with each release, and Avengers Age Of Ultron looks to be another billion something dollar gross for Marvel. As far as movies go, Guardians of the Galaxy is a prime example of why Marvel remains superior. And all that being said while the 3 year wait for the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy begins, do yourself a favor and GO SEE Guardians of the Galaxy. Because if someone were to bring up the terms style/substance, then I would certainly say Guardians has both style and substance as a movie. And there can be only one rating for a movie this good, and it is:5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Chris Pratt, Djimon Hounsou, Dave Bautista, John C Reilly, Glenn Close, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillian, Lee Pace, Benecio Del Toro, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel,Avengers Age of Ultron: May 1, 2015Guardians of the Galaxy 2: July 28, 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FV3LTFFG9IGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNM8ZA#wasThisHelpful","R2FV3LTFFG9IGM","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when a man is hell bent on revenge? What happens when a mother and her daughter are irrevocably thrown into peril? What happens when a couple chooses to be out just before a period of unspeakable terror is about to begin? What happens when for 12 hours, crime is legal?  What happens in fact, is The Purge Anarchy.With the original 2013 film, it was the way The Purge attempted to be clever and how the movie did more than just try to scare you that made it a likable movie in my opinion. In this movie, you have even more likable aspects.  I like that there is  more of a diversity to the cast this time around. I like how the story has more to offer in terms of suspense and thrills. This time around there is a lot more at stake. I like how the danger that is present in The Purge Anarchy grabs your attention more. If I were to be stuck outside during The Purge(and believe me I would NOT be) the things that play out in The Purge Anarchy are instances that you could see happening. The term ""trust only a few"" definitely comes into play in this movie.Speaking on the cast, expect to see only new faces(with one brief exception). Zach Gilford has a nice outing as the character Shane, Carmen Ejogo stars as Eva in the movie. Kiele Sanchez stars as Liz, Michael Williams stars as Carmelo Jones(and you will remember his character trust me). But it is Frank Grillo starring as Leo, the main character, the tough, no-nonsense this is gonna go my way type guy . I liked his performance a lot in the movie. If ever Marvel should ever decide to reboot The Punisher, he definitely comes to mind play the part . I think he would also make a great Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie. It would appear that director James DeMonaco aimed to make a more high-end, ""hit the ground running"" sequel and  he has done just that with The Purge Anarchy.And all this being said, while The Purge Anarchy is not the greatest sequel, it very well is better than its previous installment. Where we go after this movie remains to be seen, but I suspect a third sequel to be more than likely. My  interest to see this new franchise progress will increase, being that the ideas remain fresh.

"2011 was a year that had a surprisingly cleverly crafted movie by the name of X-Men First Class. But perhaps most memorably, 20th Century Fox also released a movie by the name of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. No one, not even myself was prepared for the extraordinary film that I was about to witness. And now ladies and gentlemen if I can  contain my excitement and use a phrase to describe this review it would be: COME ONE  COME All and prepare yourself for my thrill and amazement with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.Set years later after the Rise, Caesar and a relatively large number of apes have taken refuge in the forest. Together, they live in harmony and together they are their own civilization. Caesar's son Blue Eyes and Caesar's nephew Ash decide to take a walk in the woods and that is when, they meet Carver who is a human. And unfortunately, this chance meeting does not go well.Andy Serkis ladies and gentlemen,  truly is a master at the art of motion capture. SERIOUSLY. That distinctive look that Caesar possesses and the way he grabs the audience's attention is almost too good to be true. Caesar exemplifies his leadership by the sacrifices he is willing to make, and the love and respect he has for not just his own family but each individual ape. Serkis is excellent here, and is well deserving of the recognition he receives and more in my opinion.Judy Greer has a nice outing as Caesar's companion Cornelia. Karin Konoval portrays Maurice the orangutan from Rise and does quite well once again. And Toby Kebell plays Koba who is our not so friendly antagonist of the movie.On to the human characters, Jason Clarke stars in Dawn as Malcolm. It is he and Caesar who work to keep peace among their own respectable parties and in doing so,  an uncommon trust builds between them. I was not sure about him as an actor but he does a nicer than expected job with his portrayal. Kodi Smit McPhee ( known for movies Let Me In and The Road) stars as Malcolm's son Alexander and does a solid job. And finally, Gary Oldman (who I have the up most respect for as an actor) plays Dreyfus who is the commanding force for the remaining human group. And yes, the acting in Dawn IS wonderful.How the apes talk is one thing, but how they look is something that can only be described as: majestic. Which brings me to my thoughts on the visuals and CGI. The apes look so SO good in the movie. The movements look real, the facial expressions are believable and above all else, Dawn has only great things to offer in terms of scenery and design. Whatever worries I had about Matt Reeves taking the directing chair quickly went away after viewing Dawn. Action, suspense, drama, and emotion from both the apes and the humans make this sequel a movie that is as equally as exceptional as it's predecessor, but a sequel that has a lot more surprises,  a lot more inescapable moments and obviously a lot more apes.Yesterday, I bear witness to a movie that has a fulfilling story and an amazing cast to back it up.  Yesterday I realized that what we have is not only the best movies of the summer so far, but the WORLD has one of the best movies of 2014 here and now. And for these very reasons Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is most certainly a movie that is:5 StarsRated PG-13Supporting cast: Keri Russell,Kirk Acevedo,Doc Shaw,Kevin Rankin,","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCC401SZ9V6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNGZKZO#wasThisHelpful","R3CCC401SZ9V6S","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon meeting Hazel Lancaster, we understand that she has thyroid cancer . While on her way to a cancer support group in (I quote) "" the heart of Jesus"" she mistakenly bumps into a boy. Much to her surprise,  Augustus Waters can not stop staring at Hazel. Little does Hazel know is that there is more to Augustus than meets the eye.The Fault in our Stars offers a lot of good things as a movie ladies and gentlemen. Yes people label this movie romance and yes there are in fact romantic moments in the movie but the movie itself is more than just two kids falling in love. It's about having hope when others around you have given up. It's about accepting whatever comes your way and facing adversity head on . Shailene Woodley knows exactly what I'm talking about here. Hazel is the embodiment of these traits  I just mentioned. I was Highly impressed (and deeply moved a few times) with the way Shailene Woodley handled playing Hazel. Ansel Elgort has a nice outing as Augustus Waters in the movie. He may be over the top in the confidence department, but he exhibits a likable charm and clever attitude throughout the film so well, that it's hard to not like his character. Willem Dafoe also stars as Peter Van Houten author of An Imperial Affliction which happens to be the book Hazel is a big fan of.  I enjoyed his take on the character;  he was rather uh, interesting to say the very least. Nat Wolff also plays Augustus's friend Issac and he did a good job. Sam Trammell and Laura Dern star as Michael and Frannie Lancaster and they were also good in their respective roles.I admit I have not read the book though I do intend to, but I like how the story in the movie progresses. The Fault in our Stars works well as a drama due to each act being directed extensively, and again with the positive acting on both sides.But above all else my friends, something about The Fault in our Stars sticks with you. And strangely enough, I cannot yet decide what exactly it is. Maybe it's Shailene Woodley's uplifting performance in the movie. Maybe it's the fact that I cared about the characters in the movie. Or maybe just maybe, it is the overall feeling I had once the movie was over.So there you have it. I have given my thoughts on The Fault in our Stars the movie. I gave my thoughts on the acting, the story, and the movie as a whole.

"Movies like this are why I enjoy writing reviews for Amazon. Movies  that allow your imagination to run wild and give escapism from the real world are movies I enjoy doing reviews on. It is for those reasons I will review Edge of Tomorrow.As we are introduced to Major William Cage, you notice early on his confident attitude and his distinctive way with persuasion. But something unusual is happening to William. He, in fact is living the same day over and over again. After  meeting a higher classed soldier by the name of Rita, they have to work together in order for things to get back to the way they were.Where do I start? Well let me start with Mr. Tom Cruise ladies and gentlemen! I love when he takes on science fiction roles. And in Edge of Tomorrow, his acting is top notch on point like a ball point pen. William is a character that conveys nervousness at first but eventually shows a broad range of resilience, cunning, and smarts. Emily Blunt was also exceptional in her role as Rita. She is no diva and definitely not a damsel in distress. Fierce and fearless are words to describe her character. Bill Paxson starring as Sergeant Farrell was great in his role, giving the movie some of the more humorous lines. In terms of acting, nothing is done wrong in that department. As for the movie's special effects there is a lot to admire as the aliens, and the suits that are used look very believable. If there is one of the many things I can say about Edge of Tomorrow I can definitely say everything flows (feels) right in the movie.When you take clever and sometimes funny moments added to the fact that the acting is sharp and the movie never gets boring you have the movie called: Edge of Tomorrow. An adventure worthwhile and great for price of admission.  This is why I was excited walking out of this movie. THIS IS why in July, you can expect a lot more reviews from me.

"Snow White and the Huntsman. Hansel and Gretel. Jack the Giant Slayer. Etc.  Hollywood has(especially as of late) found a creative way to get moviegoers money by taking our favorite fairy tales and turning them into above average movies.  And now, Disney has decided to create a film based on the lady of evil herself, Maleficent.In the beginning, Maleficent is merely a child. And much to everyone's surprise, she is not evil; at least not yet anyway. Soon she meets a boy Stefan, and they become friends. Many years pass and after an sudden betrayal and the birth of a child known to us as Aurora, Maleficent shows us exactly why hell indeed hath no fury like a woman scorned.I love Angelina Jolie. I absolutely mean it. And in an effort to not sound like some overly obsessed fanboy, she was beyond excellent in her portrayal as the character. I had no idea she would do as good as she did in her role. Her Maleficent can be funny, witty, tragic, and yes she CAN definitely be wicked. This is her movie and she definitely leads the way. Ellie Fanning(from the movie Super 8) plays Princess Aurora. I was not as impressed with her performance as Jolie's but I was able to overlook it due to the fact that the movie is called Maleficent. Sharlto Copley portrays Stefan and does extremely well with his performance. Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, and Leslie Manville bring laughter and delight playing fairies: Knottgrass, Thistlewit and Flittle. And Sam Riley was great as Diaval, Maleficent's right hand er- winged friend.The special effects and designs are a reason why I will be buying the blu ray 3d version of this movie.  Every scene, and every set is beautifully choreographed. And I was equally impressed with how the story itself progressed.So what did I not like about Maleficent? Well despite Elle Fanning's somewhat lackluster performance, there is nothing I would consider bad.  It is rated PG, so while it may not appeal to everyone, I rate it9/10Rated PGCinderella March 13, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXW4KLT6LR0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNX2A4Q#wasThisHelpful","R3GXW4KLT6LR0U","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To describe my anticipation for X-Men Days of future Past, would be like changing my name to Bradley Cooper and starring in a movie with Robert DeNiro: Limitless. After the success and quality of last year's standalone film The Wolverine(see my review) nothing could have prepared me for the surprise I had coming. Take a look at my thoughts on X-Men Days of Future Past.In a not too far off but grimly depressing future, we are brought back to Wolverine, Storm, Professor X and Magneto. Also along for the ride are Bishop, Blink, Colossus(one of my favorites), Warpath, Iceman, and Kitty Pride. A deadly, destructive enemy known as sentinels; these gigantic cyborgs or robots (if you prefer) are designed for the task of killing mutants. Upon the realization that this is a far more powerful enemy than they could have possibly imagined, Wolverine is sent back in time to rebuild a relationship that was lost(Erik and Charles) and to help rewrite the wrongs of the former past in hopes of a safer, better future.My excitement and hype certainly pay off here; as this movie has everything. And by everything, I MEAN Everything. Talking about the actors/actresses, it was a warm welcome and pleasant surprise for Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Daniel Cudmore, Halle Berry, and Ellen Page. Yet again, James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender light up the screen as younger Charles and Erik. That emotional complexity and overall chemistry they have is unbelievable. Jennifer Lawrence was great(surprise right?) as Mystique, I like how they allowed her character to be more of who she is: this girl that possesses self drive based solely on her own agenda. Can Hugh Jackman do anything wrong playing Wolverine? Absolutely Not! Delivering a few memorable one liners while staying completely in tone with character, he has another solid outing as Wolverine. Peter Dinklage who plays Tyrion Lannister on a show I love Game of Thrones stars as Bolivar Trask the inventor of the sentinels. I did not mind his performance, although he is not very... well intimidating. But job well done anyway. Nicholas Hoult also has another formidable outing as Beast. And for those of you who remember what Nightcrawler did for X2 X-Men United, I want to introduce you to Evan Peters who portrays Quicksilver. He is definitely the highlight of the movie, so to Aaron Taylor Johnson who will play Quicksilver in Avengers Age of Ultron I say, watch out.What else did I like about X-Men Days of Future Past? I like the visual effects this movie has. I like how it has just the right amount of humor. I especially admired the direction and vision of director Bryan Singer even after all these years. And finally, I am glad that X-Men Days of Future Past feels like an X-Men movie should. And no, that is not at all a discredit to any of the previous movies, but more an appreciation and expression of how well this series has played out. So as an X-Men fan, comic book nerd, and as a general movie lover, X-Men Days of Future Past is:4.5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Patrick Stewart, James Mcavoy, Ian Mckellen, Michael Fassbender, Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Daniel Cudmore, Shawn Ashmore, Evan Peters, Omar Sy, Peter Dinklage,X-Men Apocalypse May 27, 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWU481DECUZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7IPGS6#wasThisHelpful","R1TWU481DECUZ3","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have many favorite heroes, on both (Marvel and DC respectively) but if anyone was to ask who my favorite Marvel property is, then my answer would be Spider-Man. From my younger days,  I can remember the first time seeing Spider-Man as a child on television. And from then on, I was immediately hooked. Sure there were Power Rangers, Catdog, and shows of that nature but few have caught my attention the way the character of  Spider-Man has. Not surprisingly, my very first comic book was a Spider-Man comic; and after that you can imagine where my allowance would be spent. Spider-Man is just a significantly inspiring character in my opinion. If you have seen my review for The Amazing Spider-Man you know how I feel about that particular movie, with all due respect to Sam Raimi's original trilogy. And after the long wait, here is my review on The Amazing Spider Man 2.As our movie begins, we see Peter's father Richard Parker in a flashback and Richard is recording a message in detail about why certain things are the way they are;  soon he and wife Mary Parker board a plane where danger is lurking. Now fast-forward a spider bite and a red and blue suit later, Peter  is living a double life as a boyfriend to Gwen Stacy, and nephew to his Aunt May, all the while protecting the citizens of New York. In one instance Spider-Man happens upon Max Dillon who secretly has an obsession with Spidey. After an accident gone horribly wrong at (where else?) Oscorp, Max Dillon is no longer who he was before. Electro is born, and so begins our movie.I gotta say this was one of those films I monitored even the tiniest details and rumor mills on. From Dane Dehaan(I'll get to him in a minute) being cast as Harry Osborn, Jamie Foxx being cast as Electro, and other actors/actresses being cast; I was absolutely puzzled/clueless at  how this was all gonna turn out. I trusted Marc Webb after the first film, but I definitely had some doubts.It is safe to say that for now, there is no other clear cut choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield was extraordinary once again as Spidey; in my opinion he improved even more. He has always reminded me of the Ultimate version of the character. The humor, the cleverness, and the overall attiude he brought in the 2012 movie is substantially better this time around. And how about Emma Stone you might ask? Well she was just as good! She definitely knows the character of Gwen Stacey. Jamie Foxx did good in his role as Max Dillon/Electro; he brought a kind of odd somberness to the character and it worked. Chris Cooper was one of the unexpected casting choices to the movie, but he did well enough as Norman Osborn, for me to not be disappointed. And as for Dane Dehaan,  he steals the show as Harry Osborn. He portrays Harry in the darkest light, and I gotta say each time I see Dane Dehaan I get more and more good vibes from his acting and definitely no shortage here.  The Effects are nicely improved this time around, and while another popular rumor was that Hans Zimmer would score the film; I had no idea how well he would do it but during the movie I quickly found out.  The music that is present during the movie goes in great with each sequence. Once again, chemistry is a worthwhile experience as Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone set sparks while having quite a few aww filled moments. As for the script, well there is a lot of good detail in the story. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is definitely more emotion ridden than the previous movie; I enjoyed how Peter acknowledged the fact that he made a promise to Captain Stacy in the first film. I also like how they re visited the mystery behind Peter's parents as well.Now I don't like talking bad about something but when it comes to movies, even the ones I enjoy or am overly hyped about; but I do feel the need to discuss them. There are a FEW times where certain scenes happen too quickly and I feel that more time was needed for those scenes to develop more. And much to my surprise, Paul Giamatti who is not a bad actor, I feel did not do justice to my favorite Spider-Man villain Rhino. His portrayal just did not excite me the way I had hoped. For everyone else it may or may not be that big of a deal but if he returns, I personally hope he has more of a backstory or a more brute force to the character. There are many people (a few of those people I am friends with actually) who have no interest in seeing this movie mainly because of the dislike of the first installment, and some just do not want to see it. I understand and see some of the criticisms and similarites between the two (Raimi vs Webb). And as a Spider-Man fan I say this: just give the movie a chance. I enjoyed the film for the most part. As a movie it does have its problems, but interestingly enough, Marc Webb leaves us with more unanswered questions like: Who is this mysteriously attractive Felicia? Who is the guy in the hat? And where does our hero go after this adventurous journey? While It may not be the amazing improvement I thought it would be, I rate The Amazing Spider-Man 2:7.7/10Rated PG-13Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane Dehaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti, Chris Cooper, Felicity Jones, Sally Field,","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOTP53M5C7BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPS7HOA#wasThisHelpful","R2SOTP53M5C7BP","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After 2014's rocky start, Finally I have a review that is going to be thoroughly positive. And I must say I am not only ready to view this movie a 2nd time, I am Eagerly ready to make the blu ray purchase for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.After a mission that pits our Captain against a deadly mercenary by the name of Batroc, Captain America is called upon by Alexander Pierce to Shield. But after an immediate distrust between these two and the rise of a new prey simply known as, Winter Soldier, Captain America is thrust into a vicious war.Chris Evans really upped his level of heroism and expertise in donning the infamous shield with honor. Samuel L Jackson I feel  did a lot better portraying Nick Fury than he did in the previous Marvel movies. And I definitely commend Marvel for making the decision to include Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. He was definitely well suited to play the character and I do hope we see more of him in the future. Scarlett Johansson's role as Black Widow was just as good; the scenes she and Captain America share make me wonder will they fall in love, or are they already there? And finally to our two forms of evil, one being acting great Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. While I would definitely like to see Redford in other movies, he had a wondrous outing as Pierce. And finally, Sebastian Stan is the right guy for the Winter Soldier. Not only does he handle the job well, but he puts fear and panic into the minds of all those determined to stop him. Impressive job by all the actors.There is so much to like that i may forget to write it all down but here it goes. The fight sequences have been getting multiple stamps of supreme approval and they get applause and acclaim from me. With every punch in the movie that lands and every time Cap throws his shield you definitely feel it. Great fight sequences combined with the fact that in the movie you never really know who to trust, which brings me to my thoughts on the story line. The writers of this movie crafted an amazing screenplay; while the way the movie plays itself is almost surreal, with the secrets and the idea of conspiracies within those who are supposed to have the best interest of mankind in their reach. It almost feels like a modern day society, if you know what I mean. The thrill and the suspense only grow with each act and as the credits rolled, the only thing I can remember thinking was: Avengers 2 & Captain America 3 NOW!!So in what has perhaps been my longest review in awhile, by living up to hype and satisfying everyone's anticipation Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only one of the best sequels Marvel has put out, it IS one of the best films Marvel Studios has made. I myself cannot wait to view/buy this movie again.

"Liam Neeson is a good actor; perhaps even great. I definitely can remember Schindler's List. He brought victory and truimph to Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia movies. And his role in Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins was very exceptional. And over the past 4 years movies like Taken, Unknown, The Grey, etc. have made him a noteworthy action star, which is why today I choose to review the movie: Non Stop.In Non Stop we meet a man by the name of William Marks. Early on it is evident that he is a bit of an alcoholic and smoker and is not exactly the social one. After boarding a flight scheduled to go to London, He is revealed to be a federal air marshal. Upon looking at his phone, William begins to receive texts instructing him to forward $150 million(small amount isn't it?) to a specific bank account or every 20 minutes a passenger will die. And so we have our thriller.Liam Neeson again rocked the film (in a good way) with his fine performance, as did his co star Julianne Moore. I really enjoyed the 2nd act of the film; while also enjoying the way the story began to unfold.So to close, Non Stop is another film that has intensity, suspense, and good acting which is why i rate the movie itself:3.5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Lupita Nyong'o, Michelle Dockery, Linus Roache, Nate Parker","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FQYUQF98FNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTD3ZW#wasThisHelpful","R23FQYUQF98FNQ","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2014 is already up and running and showing no signs of slowing down. I have not been doing as many reviews as I would definitely like to, but I am consistently working to get better and have more done in time for the summer. Just today, I came across a movie that was not at all familiar to me but one that I enjoyed watching. Lets talk about The Frozen Ground.In the movie, Cindy Paulson is found in a horrific condition by officers and later questioned by Sergeant Jack Halcombe. Upon learning the details of what has happened to her, Jack and Cindy must work to take down our antagonist Robert Hansen. And so our movie begins.Like normal, I start with the acting. I must say I was impressed with everyone's acting in the film; especially Vanessa Hudgens's and Joan Cusack's performances. Also great in his role as the lead Officer Jack Halcombe, Nicholas Cage who encompasses the character with resolve and skill.It is not always the easiest film to watch, but The Frozen Ground is a solid movie for the movie viewer. I rate this movie:8/10Rated RStarring: Nicholas Cage, Vanessa Hudgens, 50 Cent, Joan Cusack, Matt Gerald,","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HZQXXPNMVK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZP1C2W#wasThisHelpful","R38HZQXXPNMVK2","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marvel is a successful franchise not only because of the creativity of the writers/animators, but also due to uniqueness of their characters. One example would be The First Avenger himself, Captain America.We meet a man by the name of Johann Schmidt a man clearly overly obsessed with the wrong types of things. Soon later, Steve Rogers is introduced to us and though he is a smaller person, he has quite the big eye for the military. Unfortunately, he is not fit to join. But after being offered a chance to be something greater than even Steve could have possibly imagined, he immediately accepts and so begins his journey.The movie itself gets a definite stamp of approval in my book. Chris Evans is the right man for the task of bringing Captain America to life in the movie. His gratuitous, audacious attitude is the blueprint behind the costume; and the fight for what is right is clear. Sebastian Stan also had a notable stand in his role as Bucky Barnes. As for our villain, Hugo Weaving shows range and defiance here well; and in the end he portrays the Red Skull with skill.So before I get completely carried away, I will say that Captain America is a great origin movie and a wonderful superhero at that. If you have not seen this one, give a watch because it is well worth the time.

"I am a big fan of the movie 300 with Gerard Butler. So naturally when I heard there was to be a sequel, I was curious to see how it would turn out. Much to my disappointment last year, the movie which, was originally scheduled to be released in August of last year was irrevocably moved up to March of this year. So finally after my latest viewing, all the while anticipating Captain America the Winter Soldier, here are my thoughts on 300 Rise of an Empire.So In 300 Rise of an Empire, set after the brutal events of the previous film, we hear Queen Gorgo begin a grand story in which our soon to be main protagonist Themistocles, is famed for the assassination of King Darius. Little does Themistocles realize is that soon, he will be forced to deal with another baddy Artemisia, and thus 300 Rise of an Empire begins.There are good things and bad things in this movie. Lena Headey did a fine job narrating throughout the movie. I feel that it gave the movie an almost poetic type feel to the film itself. Another good thing is as with the last 300, this one has no shortage of action sequences. And finally, Eva Green starring as Artemisia. She does a stellar job with the character, and she definitely can handle a sword. I appreciated the depth and aura in her character. Now lets talk about the not so good things.Sullivan Stapleton's character Themistocles was also quite interesting. I feel his performance was alright, but he just doesn't have the same resonance as Gerard Butler's Leonidas. And too there are times where I felt his acting felt kind of forced but it was pretty easy to overlook. Another thing that bothered me(but only a little) is the script. The first act and third act were really good, but nothing in the second act really caught my attention as much. But despite those minor nitpicks, the movie is still one I would consider fair.Overall, while Rise of an Empire is not as good as the first, the movie has good things to offer. And as for my final rating for the movie well, here it is:3 StarsRated RStarring: Lena Headey, Eva Green, Sullivan Stapleton, Rodrigo Santoro,","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197XYX8I7X75R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEJL6Q8#wasThisHelpful","R197XYX8I7X75R","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a movie I had been wanting to see for quite some time and I must say I am glad I finally did. My thoughts on the movie Rush.Rush is based on the true stories of formula 1 race drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. In Rush, James is classified as being an arrogant, drug addicted playboy. Then we have Niki who not only has a heart for formula 1, but also has the skill set and drive.  But once these two meet each other, it begins an unforgettable rivalry.Rush has a lot to love and a lot to offer as a movie. I should start by mentioning that this movie has some of the best cinematography I have seen in a movie (sorry Gravity) and the set pieces are very convincing.Among the many great performances of the whole movie, Daniel Bruhl's performance (which got a lot of acclaim) is absolute fire. Like, I really can not understand why the certain movies/actors/actresses get nominated in favor of others that actually deserve it, but I should not start an unecessary rant on how I feel about the Motion Picture Academy. Nonetheless, His performance was nothing short of brilliant. Chris Hemsworth's performance was gratifying as well. Great job with the acting.To close, Rush triumphs due to the fact that all acts are perfectly executed, the acting/chemistry on both ends is equally sharp, and its overall setup and direction is boldly sequenced. Rush is definitely a movie worthy of:5 StarsRated RStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, Christian Mckay, Olivia Wilde,","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PG5FOG7M6FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYP1W#wasThisHelpful","R2PG5FOG7M6FU","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the request of a friend who reads my reviews often, he offered me the chance to watch this movie. It is Oscar Sunday and today I bring you my review on: The Counselor.In the movie we get introduced to a guy who is known throughout the movie simply as, Counselor. Mr.Counselor lives a pretty above decent lifestyle: the nice car, house, beautiful girlfriend. But one thing that is apparent early on is that he has ties to some pretty dangerous people or people with bad dealings. An example would be Counselor and one character discussing a drug deal. But without giving too much away, here are more details on why I choose to review this movie.First, the characters. I enjoyed how well each actor personified his/her role in the movie. The story line has a dark tone; and I don't mean grotesque or horrifying, but more like a cunning, devious feel to it. The Counselor is not exactly unpredictable, but there are times when you are not always sure who to trust. The Counselor is not great but fortunately for the viewer, it does has some good moments.I have read a lot of the reviews for this movie specifically. As for my final thought, it would be to say that Ridley Scott certainly has not made a classic or movie to completely rave about with The Counselor, but it is an intriguing, mentionable addition to his filmography as a director. I will not say that you will buy this movie once you watch it, but I give this movie a likable3 StarsRated RStarring: Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Javier Bardeem, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Rosie Perez, Toby Kebbell,","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W352713QLR6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF98SY4#wasThisHelpful","R2W352713QLR6Y","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never talked much about myself personally when doing reviews on amazon; but watching this film was a reminder of where I was as a child. As a former foster child myself, this movie was definitely something I could easily relate to. And I don't bring that up for sympathy or for credit, but just an added reason of why today I chose to review the film: Short Term 12.Grace is an worker at a Group Home for teenagers. We are introduced to her co-workers: Jessica, Nate, and Mason who is also Grace's boyfriend. Soon we see kids: Marcus, who has a talent for making words rhyme, Luis who has a knack for trouble, Sammy who tries to runaway from time to time, and finally Jayden a troubled girl with a gifted artistic ability.I will start by saying I wish Brie Larson had been nominated at least for a Golden Globe award. As Grace, she embodies the qualities of dedication, and resilience so well, that it is almost hard not to believe she is not a case worker in real life. And as for the kids involved, they get the stamp of approval just as well. A few times during the movie I was moved to tears, while other times I found myself delighted.Short Term 12 has great acting, great direction and a positively believable story line behind it. I stand by this movie wholeheartedly, so without question or thought Short Term 12 is:10 out 10Rated RStarring: Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr.,  Keith Stanfield, Rami Malek,  Stephanie Beatriz, Kaitlyn Dever","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RR68M3KZA051/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGVRZR4#wasThisHelpful","R2RR68M3KZA051","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After my last review on Thor the Dark World, I kinda took a step back and told myself I needed a break. I was planning to take a break from movie watching and reviewing, but I did not plan to watch movies like You're Next, Dead Man Down, and Don Jon during this period. Nonetheless, that is exactly what ended up happening, and today I bring my review on the movie Don Jon.Don Jon introduces us to Jon Martello(classic name huh?) and Jon is a guy who is has his own house,car, etc. He is a player, meaning he gets a lot of girls for sex, but the strange thing about our character Jon, is that although he gets plenty of girls, he watches pornography. As a matter of fact he tells us(the audience) that he prefers the porn movies. Soon Jon meets the a girl Barbara Sugarman who he believes to be the girl he has been waiting his whole life for. But  as luck would have it, he meets another lady by the name of Esther who we see as being the better girl for Jon. And so begins our movie.I have to say that as a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt and independent films, I was excited to hear earlier last year that he would be directing a his own movie for the first time. And once I read up on the premise, I won't say I wasn't in the least bit baffled; because in all honesty I was, but I figured that Don Jon would still be a movie worth watching. And for the most part it is. We get a guy who has the good looks gets all the girls, watches porn and goes to church on Sunday. Its funny too because (SPOILER) in the film one of our main female characters compares him to a junkie. But there are some serious moments in the movie as well. If I could point out some of the highlights of the film, would be Julianne Moore's and Scarlett Johansson's performances.Don Jon is like Spring Breakers in a sense because it has topics that we tend to avoid or are too ashamed to discuss, but I do feel that it has this charisma or confidence about it that makes it a movie worth mentioning. Because lets be honest, any other movie about a guy's addiction to porn would probably not be as worthwhile as this movie is. I won't say that after you watch this movie you are going to want to go out and buy it(which, if you do then to each his/her own), but I will say that Don Jon is a movie that gets:3.5 StarsRated RStarring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Tony Danza, Julianne Moore, Brie Larson,","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSSQLT8O2SMHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRILRW0#wasThisHelpful","RSSQLT8O2SMHV","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I was heavily critical last year about the high grossing, yet controversial movie Iron Man 3, I was keeping tidbits and a close eye on reports about Thor the Dark World. And I chose to do the review at an almost convenient time; if 24 days before its dvd/blu-ray release date is what you call convenient. So here are my thoughts on Thor the Dark World.After the almost cataclysmic events of The Avengers, Loki is punished for his crimes he has committed while on Earth. And as for our main hero Thor, is meanwhile informed that the 9 realms are to be aligned. Soon, his love interest Jane Foster is sucked into another world and later infected therefore given a resurection to our main antagonist Malekith(Christopher Eccleston). A war soon begins and upon realizing the fight is too great even for him, Thor enlists Loki's assistance in defeating Malekith, and so our movie begins.Thor continues to surprise me. Chris Hemsworth was great once again as the titular hero in this movie. Tom Hiddleston didn't necessarily steal the show, but he once again delivered wonders, and humor as Loki. Also returning are Natalie Portman as Jane, Kat Dennings as Darcy, Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Jaimie Alexander as Sif.All in all, as Phase 2 began with Iron Man 3, Thor the Dark World is an enjoyable and highly likable sequel thanks to the acting, visuals, and the story line that started the movie off on the right track, and ends with a surprise cliffhanger. Not only is this a good movie, but Thor the Dark World is a sequel that refines everything good about the 2011 film.9.1/10Rated PG-13Supporting Cast: Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Eccelston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ray Stevenson, Rene Russo, Chris Evans,Captain America: The Winter Soldier:April 4, 2014Guardians of the Galaxy:August 1, 2014Avengers Age of Ultron: May 1, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S974YQ9PZFMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HERGM86#wasThisHelpful","R3S974YQ9PZFMI","A2R1YK3THA0RB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1YK3THA0RB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! All I can say is WOW!!!! I did not expect to like this movie at all, particularly because I have been overly critical of Mark Wahlberg's acting, but I have definitely been proven wrong. My thoughts on the movie: Lone Survivor.Lone Survivor starts out by introducing us to US soldiers Marcus, Michael (often referenced as ""Mikey""), Danny, ""Axe"", Shane, and Erik. Erik is the primary leader or rather, facilitator of the operation (based on real life Operation Red Wings), and he instructs the soldiers to go on a mission to track Ahmad Shah who is our main antagonist. And so begins our adventure.There are so many good things to say about Lone Survivor. And you who have read my reviews know I like to start with the acting; so I will say, the acting is great, like SERIOUSLY great. Pain and Gain was definitely not one of Mark Wahlberg's highlight movies, but was highly notable as Marcus in the movie. Ben Foster was on point in his role as Axe, Alexander Ludwig was actually quite the talent for his role as Shane, Emile Hirsch's character Danny was one to remember, and Taylor Kitsch courageously holds his ground extremely well as Michael. Great acting.To close, even though Lone Survivor has 2 nominations, I am not only surprised that this movie(along with the likes of The Butler, The Spectacular Now, Fruitvale Station, etc. etc) were overlooked much to my dismay with the award shows as of recent, I am also pleasantly surprised at how great this movie is. I enjoyed it, the people in the theater(as evidenced by the multiple applauds at the end) enjoyed it and I have a feeling anyone will enjoy this movie.

"And with no further adieu, here is what I think about Captain Phillips.We have a movie that is based on real events, hence being introduced to the titular character Richard(""Rich"" in the movie). Richard Phillips is given the task of taking command of a ship by the name MV Maersk Alabama. And as he aboards the ship things are running ever so smoothly. However, after taking notice of two not-so-familiar boats that are approaching the ship, our Captain finds himself at the very center of a hostage crisis, and from there, we have our movie.I should start by saying that I did do some research going into the movie; and although there have been reports that this movie itself is not entirely accurate, I loved Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks has had numerous good/great performances; THIS IS one of his greats. From beginning to end, he personifies the role of the Captain turned hostage very well. And though Barkhad Abdi is relatively an unknown actor, he was equally as great in his role as Abduwali Muse. Great acting.The situation on screen is almost unbearable; many times during the movie I was holding my breath because of the intensity of the scenes and the savagery of the Somalian pirates. They are not clever, but they have guns, and their leader Abduwali has a motive.If you have not yet seen Captain Phillips, I urge everyone to give this movie a watch.

"Japanese animation or Anime is justly famous for animating concepts that no one in his right mind,... uh,... that is,... nobody else would ever think of, and Girls Und Panzer is in a class by itself.In a slightly alternate universe, in addition to the traditional feminine arts of calligraphy, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, young Japanese school girls are also encouraged to learn the only slightly newer traditional feminine art of Sensha-do or Tankery, tank combat as a sport, a sport which has spread around the world.This is actually less insanely lethal than it sounds.  Special sensors and reduced power tank rounds are used in order to make the game as safe as possible, and while there is always the possibility of decapitating a tank commander with a wayward shell or suffering a fire or other mishap, nobody is supposed to die or be seriously injured.As our story opens, Miho Nishizumi has transferred to the Oarai Girl's Academy in order to AVOID Tankery because she had a falling out with her mother and older sister over how far she was willing to go in order to win at her previous school, Kuromorimine Girl's High School, the acknowledged premier school for Tankery in the world thanks to her family's contributions.  Her mother is the Tankery instructor, the hardnosed advocate of the Nishizumi Style of Tankery that takes pride in strength and despises weakness, and Miho had lost what would have been Kuromorimine's tenth straight victory in the national tournament of Tankery by abandoning her command tank in the midst of battle in order to save some teammates when their tank fell into deep water, an action that was pretty much condemned by everybody,... excepting those she saved from drowning.  Unfortunately, for reasons revealed later in the story, Oarai is reviving their Tankery course, and Miho gets dragooned into it.  What follows is a parody of every sports story ever told as a hopeless band of Tankery newbies and misfits must band together, learn quickly, and train hard in order to Win It All against impossible odds while teaching those who have forgotten that it's not supposed to be a war, that it's supposed to be fun.The creators do an amazing job of handling a very large cast, in part by dividing the girls up into shared interest/situation teams assigned to specific tanks: the disbanded volleyball club, the history buffs, the first years, the student council, the auto club, the hall monitors, and the online gamers.  Only reluctant commander Miho's crew is particularly diverse: the flower arranging gunner, the narcoleptic driver, the advice-to-the-lovelorn radio operator, and the fanatically tank obsessed loader.  They also have a lot of fun with international stereotypes in the various school opponents: the unflappable, tea swilling British (from china cups mind you, DURING battle), the insanely wealthy and overly dedicated to fair play Americans (calling penalty strokes on themselves), the passionately enthusiastic Italians (best food, weakest tanks, most audacious tactics, most enjoyable post loss party), the bombastic, chip on the shoulder Russians, and the Kuromorimine girls who combine the most unpleasant characteristics of both German and Japanese militarism into something that has EVERYBODY cheering against them.  With the odds so hopeless, much of the fun is seeing how Miho and the Oarai Girls deal with the challenges; their apparently developed on the fly tactics for taking out the super heavy Platz Maus Kuromorimine Version from Anime TV Series of Girls und Panzer Kit, 1:35 Scale (arguably the strongest tank available under Tankery rules), during the championship match are insane but appear workable.  Arguably, Miho turns hers and her team's inexperience into a virtue by coming up with a brand new set of tactics idealized for each opponent while they operate under the unrecognized burden of their team styles, which hammer every opposing team as if it were an identical nail.But, let us be honest with ourselves, the REAL reason to watch this show is the gorgeous, heart-stoppingly beautiful, drool-worthy, anatomically correct,...WWII era tanks.(The big eyed, large bosomed, outlandishly hair styled, sailor suit clad anime girls are easy on the eyes as well.)Note: Several manga spinoffs are available:a two volume prequel:Girls und Panzer: Little Army Vol. 1,Girls und Panzer: Little Army Vol. 2,and a four volume adaptation of the first season:Girls und Panzer Vol. 1,Girls und Panzer Vol. 2,Girls und Panzer Vol. 3,Girls und Panzer Vol. 4.While these stray from the canon in a number of areas, most notably during the Anzio battle, the projected plot for which must have changed drastically before the OVA was animated, they also clarify a few mysteries from the TV show, and thus are probably worth purchasing for fans.Note: The two compilation episodes produced and televised in Japan because the creators were failing to meet their deadlines are included, though only in Japanese with English subtitles.  ""Introductions!"" which fits between TV episodes 5 and 6 is in the Special Features section on Disc 2, and ""Introductions 2!"" which fits between TV episodes 10 and 11 is in the Special Features section on Disc 3.  (On the Blu-ray both can be found in the Special Features section on Disc 2.)Note: A DVD collecting six Girls und Panzer OVA Specials is a must buy for fans of the TV series; among the most interesting things are an episode explaining (to the extent that is even possible) why all of the schools are built on converted or replicated aircraft carriers and a longer, more detailed version of the battle winning reconnaissance mission during the TV episode 9 match against Pravda.  (There are also a couple of episodes where the cast spends most of their time wearing bathing suits for those interested in that kind of stuff.)Note: A new OVA episode has been released in Japan but not yet here, entitled ""This is the Real Anzio Battle!""  Set during TV episode 7, this depicts the full story of the battle with Anzio that until now had taken place offstage.Note: For those interested in a chronological listing of TV and OVA episodes combined, here is my best guess:From internal evidence OVA episodes 1 and 2, in that order (because the swimsuits purchased in the first are still being worn in the second) take place before the first tournament match, which means between TV episodes 4 and 5.From internal evidence OVA episode 3 must take place after Yukari's reconnaissance mission before the Saunders match in TV episode 5 (and arguably after the Saunders match itself in TV episode 6} and before the hunt for more tanks in the latter half of TV episode 7, so I place it at around the halfway point of TV episode 7, well before the Anzio match at the very end of TV episode 7, which is expanded in OVA episode 7.OVA episode 4, which includes the Hall Monitors but no later joining teams in a costumed, Oarai set performance of the Angler Fish Dance of Shame, must take place sometime between their joining in TV episode 7 and the other teams joining in TV episode 10.  Since exactly these girls performed exactly this dance, albeit in their competition uniforms on the field of battle during the match with Pravda in TV episode 9, the logical conclusion is that this was a commemorative performance of what was now a Dance of Defiance, taking place during TV episode 10 after returning to Oarai victorious.OVA episode 5 is a longer, more detailed version of the battle winning reconnaissance mission during the TV episode 9 match against Pravda.OVA episode 6 is the tale of what happened at the victory banquet after TV episode 12.All of this results in the following chronology:TV  1-4,OVA 1-2,TV  5,TV  5.5 compilation ""Introductions!"",TV  6,TV  7, 1st half,OVA 3,TV  7, 2nd half,OVA 7,TV  8,TV  9, 1st half,OVA 5,TV  9, 2nd half,TV 10, 1st half,OVA 4,TV 10, 2nd half,TV 10.5 compilation ""Introductions 2!"",TV 11-12,OVA 6.Note: Since it isn't obvious at first glance, it is worth mentioning that this anime parody is truly suitable for all audiences.  There is no gratuitous violence (or any real violence at all), no gratuitous nudity or even near nudity (there are some brief sauna scenes with everything covered, and a couple of OVA episodes with lots of skimpy bathing suits, but that's it), no panty shots, and no sex.  You can watch this with your youngest children, and the only thing to worry about is the possibility that they might develop an unhealthy interest in armored vehicles.  What's more, the values being taught are all laudatory: making friends and being a friend, teamwork, playing fair, school loyalty, watching out for each other's safety, trying your best, having fun, giving thanks where thanks are due, and caring for each other.  Pride, arrogance, cheating, and winning at all costs are gently but steadily condemned.Note: If you love the show, chances are you love the music, too, so you are likely to want the original soundtrack album Girls und Panzer / O.S.T., and the main reason is the second disc.  That's because while the first disc contains several arrangements of the main theme and a nice collection of expanded musical snippets of BGM from the show, the second disc contains the complete opening and ending songs, the complete march or marches from the various schools, the version of Katyusha with Russian lyrics that Sentai Filmworks was unable to license, and the complete version of the Angler Fish dance of shame song with Japanese lyrics.Finally, a salute to the Kelly's Heroes fans among the creators who worked several references to this classic WWII tank movie into the plot from Yukari Akiyama identifying herself as Sergeant Oddball during her reconnaissance mission in TV episode 5 to the Rabbit Team being shown watching the film on DVD, specifically the scene of the Sherman tank taking out the second Tiger tank from the rear, in TV episode 10 (and using the same tactic to take out an Elefant tank destroyer in the final match in TV episode 12).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGAAHW78XO8FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGYI6CS#wasThisHelpful","RGAAHW78XO8FB","A3BTL4FV6ODKAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BTL4FV6ODKAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The juxtaposition of comedy and horror is not especially unusual, but I've rarely seen such absolutely lunatic comedy contrasted with such gruesome horror, which makes for some pretty wide swings in overall episode mood.  If you haven't seen it before, you never know whether in a given episode you are going to see our heroes tangling with monsters that can merely make them smell bad or monsters that can rip their bodies or their minds to shreds.  Thus IMHO the comedy serves a useful purpose: it allows us to get to know (and get to like) the characters under less stressful than life or death situations and it lightens the mood because without it this would be a pretty depressing ordeal.At its most basic Beyond the Boundary is Yet Another story about young monster slayers.  The monsters are Youmu, invisible-to-ordinary-humans spirit creatures, said to be the product of negative human emotions.  As a result, most (though by no means all) youmu are harmful, ranging from annoying pranksters through vicious killers to world consuming horrors, and the only thing standing between them and us are a relative handful of young men and women with the spiritual affinity necessary to see youmu and the supernatural abilities (and the willingness to use them) necessary to destroy them.  Finally, when a youmu is killed, it drops a Youmu Stone, which can be exchanged for money at a sanctioned appraiser who pays out according to things like aggressiveness, degree of difficulty, etc.  This is strangely similar to how the economy works in the light novel/manga/anime series  Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, but with two important differences.  In IIWTTTPUGIAD adventurers slay monsters for fame, fortune,... and girls (Don't ask!), but in BTB the only practical goal is money.  After all there isn't much fame to be had for slaying monsters most people cannot even see and which you are not even allowed to talk about with normies, and spirit world warriors tend to have it pretty awful in the romance department.  For example Shizuku Ninomiya, a rather attractive and personable (if slightly silly) spirit world warrior working as a teacher at the high school most of the characters attend gets dumped so often it has become a joke to her spirit world oblivious students.  Izumi Nase, effective head of the Nase clan of spirit world warriors goes so far as to counsel her younger sister, Mitsuki, to stay alone until she retires, something Izumi seems to be practicing herself, which has resulted in Mitsuki missing out on most normal childhood experiences with her ""normal"" peers.  In light of this, spirit world warrior Yayoi Kanbara producing a child with a youmu father doesn't seem all that inconceivable, in any sense of the word.Into this grim situation come our two main protagonists: Akihito Kanbara, the half human, half youmu product of said union and Mirai Kuriyama, the last living member of a cursed and nearly exterminated clan of spirit world warriors that use their own blood as a lethal weapon, and amazingly, joyously, they manage to hit it off, though naturally they are the last to know it.  Despite his fetish for glasses, her overuse of the phrase that translates to ""how unpleasant"", and an entire box full of screwball comedy romantic complications, not to mention all this spirit world business, they gradually, oh, so gradually fall in love, but is happiness even possible for them in this world where the greatest evil comes not from rampaging youmu but rather from the horrifyingly corrupt human mind and heart?Let's just say it comes to a satisfying ending IMHO,...or rather it SEEMS to....I've got to give the creators credit, they made a sincere effort to give those viewers who would rather stop here a seemingly happy ending, but the story isn't really happily ended, not by a long shot.  I'll give you one word:amnesia.Yes, it's the most overused trick in an author's toolbox, but it is used with great care and skill here.  If someone had lived a life filled with misery and regret, wouldn't said person be happier if it were now possible to live without all those sad memories?  Even if it meant you had to give up associating?  Even if you had been in love?  More importantly, do you have the right to make that decision for someone else?  All these questions are considered in a story that also ties up some loose ends from the TV show you might have forgotten about in the rush of the cataclysmic climax.  This is the plot of ""Beyond the Boundary: The Future"", the second of two movies produced after the series ended, the first ""Beyond the Boundary: The Past"", being a compilation film, and though watching the compilation is optional, watching the second really isn't if you would have a true happy ending.  Unfortunately, it is only available online at present, but hopefully Sentai Filmworks will eventually release it as well.  Interestingly, to a much greater extent than the TV series, it drives home a moral that works for spirit world warriors and normies alike: don't go it alone.  A burden shared is a burden eased whether you are talking about couples, families, or friends.  In a time when the increasing tendency is to get completely wrapped up in our own worlds with our own problems, that's good and perhaps even necessary advice.Note: All versions of this TV series complete collection include a prequel OAV Episode 0 that shows what happened when Akihito and the Nase family first met and 5 episodes of ""Beyond the Boundary Trial Idol!"" which amount to a self-parody.  I would recommend watching Episode 0 first, before the 12 regular episodes and then watching the 5 idol trial episodes afterwards because otherwise they will make no sense.  Finally, track down and watch ""Beyond the Boundary: The Future"".Note: When it comes to subtitles versus voice dubbing, I'm no purist; I'm willing to accept either though all things being equal I prefer dubbing to subbing so that I can watch what's showing on the rest of the screen easier.  However, all is not equal in this set.  For reasons I could only speculate upon, the subtitling is better, providing information the dubbing does not.  So if you would understand as much as possible about what is going on watch the subtitled version at least once, and pay attention.Note: The Collector's Edition comes with both Blu-ray and DVD discs, but basic sets are available a lot more cheaply in either Blu-ray or DVD only versions.  Of course you don't get the extra goodies in those, the most significant of which are those infamous red glasses, just perfect for collectors, cosplayers,... and perverts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVBK9ZSN2270/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGYIRWC#wasThisHelpful","RXVBK9ZSN2270","A3BTL4FV6ODKAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BTL4FV6ODKAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Quirky, oddball, perhaps even slightly mad but ultimately endearing characters make yet another cautionary tale about the consequences of time travel into one of the most memorable, heartrending tales you will ever watch.  Self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe attends (and disrupts) Dr. Nakabachi's seminar on time travel and has a number of unsettling experiences that will eventually mean much, ending with seeing Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood.  His almost inadvertent text to ""Daru"" Hashida, who was conducting experiments with his cell phone hooked up to a microwave at the time, triggers the first temporal anomaly, in which past events have changed leaving only Okabe to remember them.What follows are several mostly lighthearted episodes in which Okabe, Daru, and a very much alive Kurisu Makise conduct experiments first to prove and then to understand and improve upon the time travel mechanism they have stumbled upon, including allowing some of their friends to try to alter past events more to their liking.  This builds slowly to a cataclysmic event at the end of episode 12 and several shocking reveals.  Now the show's tone grows increasingly dark as an increasingly frantic Okabe, who is the only one able to fully remember all the time changes, attempts to undo the horrific events he unintentionally unleashed or caused to be set in motion.  With the aid of a Kurisu Makise he must repeatedly explain the time changes to, can Okabe leap backwards through time carefully enough to fix the mess he has created?And can he bear the ever increasing emotional cost?Note: This set contains all 24 episodes of the TV show, plus the OAV episode ""Egoistic Poriomania"" set two months after the end of the show on both Blu-ray and DVD but does NOT contain either ""Steins;Gate the Movie: Burdened Domain of Déjà Vu"" set a year after the end of the series nor the four ""Steins;Gate The Sagacious Wisdom of Cognitive Computing"" animated shorts.  IMHO these last two are nice-to-haves fans will wish to watch online at least one, particularly the movie as it first annoyingly presents another obstacle to a HEA ending but then pretty cleverly resolves it while tying off a few loose ends left over from the show.  Hopefully it will be released on home video in the not too distant future.Note: Steins Gate began as a visual novel available in various formats.Steins;Gate - PC (Regular Edition),Steins;Gate - PC (Limited Edition),Steins;Gate - PlayStation 3,Steins;Gate - PlayStation Vita.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A20Y0QBPUILS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU3Y5CG#wasThisHelpful","R2A20Y0QBPUILS","A3BTL4FV6ODKAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BTL4FV6ODKAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of course the Sun King is a direct reference to King Louis XIV of France, but I contend that the more apt comparison is with Napoleon Bonaparte.  Louis never conquered the world, but Napoleon came fairly close.  Louis was actually shorter than Napoleon, but due to differences between the lengths of the French and British inches and the fact that Napoleon was usually surrounded by exceptionally tall bodyguards, the myth that Napoleon was short is the one that has come down to us.  Finally, while both men had plenty of women, only Napoleon was truly in love with one woman and one woman only:the Empress Josephine, an unconventional woman, who was older than he was.At the age of 15 Livius I is the ruler of his world, following a three-year campaign of conquest characterized by military brilliance and utter ruthlessness that began when he ascended to the throne after his mother's assassination.  You could say that the murder of his mother changed him, even unhinged him, but you'd better not say it in his presence.  Livius' victory has brought peace and prosperity to most peoples in most places, because (unlike Napoleon) he is about as competent at ruling as he is at conquering, but Livius is a little bit bored with peace.  He is never more alive than when he is dodging assassination attempts and calculating how to use them as excuses to justify crushing his remaining enemies, whether they had anything to do with it or not.Somewhere in all of this the decision was made that it was time for Livius to marry, but as with everything else, cold, ruthless calculation was behind it, not love, and certainly not lust.  The far off (but not far enough off) Principality of Rain was told that if they wished to keep their autonomy, they must provide Livius with a bride from among the four royal daughters, all of whom possessed the royal family's traditional magical power of summoning rain, something that would be very useful in Livius' home country, the Sun Kingdom, an arid land Livius had already put considerable effort into building an irrigation system for.  Though generally accepting of the idea that it was the duty of at least the younger royal daughters to make advantageous marriages for their homeland, having heard nothing but bad things about Livius, no one was willing to volunteer for the job so the youngest, 17 year old Nike got the nod after losing a game of rock, paper, scissors.As expected these two initially got along about as well as matter and antimatter (within minutes of meeting Livius, Nike gets herself thrown into prison to starve; she breaks out that night spouting threats to kill, fillet, and eat Livius), but gradually grow fond of each other as they begin to understand each other through various shared adventures that run the gamut from comical to deadly serious.  In the manga the story continues, but this is a pretty good place to end the anime, though I'd prefer to see more.Note: This show is only subtitled in English.

"After fifteen years of brutal, indecisive warfare between humans and demons, a human Hero comes along, equipped with great fighting skills and overwhelming magical powers, ready to end the war with a single stroke by slaying the Demon King, but after leaving behind his equally heroic companions and storming the Demon King's castle alone, he finds a beautiful demon girl who says that she is the Demon King and that she belongs to him, and he to her, and has ever since he was born.  Instead of fighting and killing each other she suggests that they join forces, in what is all but name a marriage contract, and discover a way to end the war in such a way as to bring real peace and true prosperity to both humans and demons alike.This truly is an odd one, in many ways reminiscent of Spice & Wolf, that proposes to teach you something while telling you a story, namely how improvements in food production, education, and certain scientific breakthroughs can lead to increasing prosperity, greater freedom, and peace.  As such, the most exciting scenes are not the battles, though they are exciting enough, but rather other things: a fiery stem-winder of a speech that rouses a population of cowering peasants into a revolutionary army, an intricate commodity futures trading scheme that undermines a more powerful enemy's war effort, and an abandoned human garrison and associated merchants working out a power sharing arrangement with the demon inhabitants of a human conquered city whose trust said garrison's good behavior has earned and who have no desire to see war roll through their hometown for a second time.It is also a hilarious, fan service featuring harem tale, as both the Demon King (Queen) and the Female Knight struggle to get the virgin Hero they are both in love with to make up his dithering mind, which does not get easier when the Fire Dragon demon clan Grand Princess joins the contest.Defects?  Well, the lack of character names takes some getting used to; everyone in this world is known simply by his or her title: the Hero, the Demon King, the Knight, etc.  More importantly a noticeable amount of detail was lost cramming this story into a mere 12 episodes; in particular the Mage, a character apparently inhabited by three spirits simultaneously is barely utilized and not at all explained.  Still, this was a fun and, yes, educational romp that I'd love to see continued or amplified in English translations of the novels and the manga.Just be careful if you watch it.  Like the stubborn, pigheaded sons of nobles personally taught by the Demon King in disguise as the Crimson Scholar, if you are not careful, you might learn something,...without even realizing it.Note: This show is only subtitled in English.

"With most room heaters, you end up either huddling around it or retreating to the edges of the room, depending on your personal comfort range and the chosen setting.  This is only the second one I've tried where the temperature achieved around the heater and at the edges of the room feel pretty much the same., and unlike the Vornado MVH Whole Room Vortex Heater, Black, this model has a temperature setting thermostat.Defects?  The lack of an EFFECTIVE fan only setting.  Oh it has one, but that setting doesn't move anything like the speed or volume of air that a regular fan would.

"Note: The publisher has unfortunately given the same exact titles to both the light novels and the numerically corresponding manga volumes, when they already had the same author and illustrator!  Now, since the stories in both are basically identical (except that Volume 2 of the manga only covers from Chapter 6 of the first novel through the first part of Chapter 1 of the second novel, leaving the rest to Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Vol. 3 (manga), chances are that if you love one you will also love the other, with the novels giving you more details and the manga giving you more visuals.  However, in order to purchase the version you actually want, you must be sitting on the correct product page.For the novel click here: Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Vol. 2 (novel).For the manga click here: Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Vol. 2 (manga).Note: Another reason for purchasing both is that some manga volumes include text pieces apparently cut from the novels.  For example Vol. 2 (manga) includes a Special Episode ""The Goddess' Job Situation"" apparently cut from Chapter 1 of Vol. 2 (novel).Note: An animated TV series has also been produced in Japan and made available at various digital outlets in this country though not yet officially released on home video.  Having seen it, I can assert that it is excellent also and tracks the light novels and manga very well, though of necessity it cuts out the most story.  The second part of TV episode 2 and episode 3 correspond to this manga.Dungeons & Dragons the Fantasy Roleplaying Game has inspired countless novels and stories (and a hilarious comedy sketch about some gamers with goals somewhat similar to Bell's on Take Down The Grand Master by The Dead Alewives), not to mention an entire industry of roleplaying games, but very few good novels and stories incorporating anything of the game system itself.  In fact I'd venture to say that this series is the first success at it and a true joy to read for gamers and non-gamers alike, besides.The story that began in Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Vol. 1 (manga) continues.  Having obtained the magical knife she wanted to get for Bell from her former BFF Hephaistos through a combination of intense begging, promises to work it off, and maybe, just maybe starting to convince Hephaistos that she has really changed, Hestia decides to wait to give it to him until after their ""date"" at the Monster Festival (Bell is actually trying to bring a purse to a friend who had forgotten it.)  This proves nearly disastrous as Freya, the Goddess of Beauty, who has become infatuated with Bell, decides to test him by releasing several monsters, in particular a giant white-haired gorilla that she sends after Hestia.  Soon Bell and Hestia are fleeing for their lives.  Realizing he can neither beat this monster nor flee it forever while carrying Hestia, Bell decides to sacrifice his life so that Hestia can escape, leaving her behind sputtering and unable to give him the magic knife.  Can Hestia catch up to Bell before he is killed and give him both the status update and the weapon he needs to win?Meanwhile, though Bell is too clueless to see it, his potential harem is assembling right before his eyes.  Every girl he gets to know seems to end up falling for him: for his honesty, for his kindness, for his work ethic, for his innocence and purity, even for his courage, usually on display when he's the most scared out of his wits: his goddess, his guild supervisor, waitresses at his local tavern, Freya the Goddess of Beauty (What a piece of work she is!), even Aiz Wallenstein, his secret crush and the greatest female adventurer of all time, though she is getting depressed over the way he screams and runs away every time she saves him (she's obviously starting to think there is something wrong, something monstrous about her).The adventure continues in Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Vol. 3 (manga).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOUDPM0RA13N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316345911#wasThisHelpful","R2NOUDPM0RA13N","A3BTL4FV6ODKAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BTL4FV6ODKAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The juxtaposition of comedy and horror is not especially unusual, but I've rarely seen such absolutely lunatic comedy contrasted with such gruesome horror, which makes for some pretty wide swings in overall episode mood.  If you haven't seen it before, you never know whether in a given episode you are going to see our heroes tangling with monsters that can merely make them smell bad or monsters that can rip their bodies or their minds to shreds.  Thus IMHO the comedy serves a useful purpose: it allows us to get to know (and get to like) the characters under less stressful than life or death situations and it lightens the mood because without it this would be a pretty depressing ordeal.At its most basic Beyond the Boundary is Yet Another story about young monster slayers.  The monsters are Youmu, invisible-to-ordinary-humans spirit creatures, said to be the product of negative human emotions.  As a result, most (though by no means all) youmu are harmful, ranging from annoying pranksters through vicious killers to world consuming horrors, and the only thing standing between them and us are a relative handful of young men and women with the spiritual affinity necessary to see youmu and the supernatural abilities (and the willingness to use them) necessary to destroy them.  Finally, when a youmu is killed, it drops a Youmu Stone, which can be exchanged for money at a sanctioned appraiser who pays out according to things like aggressiveness, degree of difficulty, etc.  This is strangely similar to how the economy works in the light novel/manga/anime series  Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, but with two important differences.  In IIWTTTPUGIAD adventurers slay monsters for fame, fortune,... and girls (Don't ask!), but in BTB the only practical goal is money.  After all there isn't much fame to be had for slaying monsters most people cannot even see and which you are not even allowed to talk about with normies, and spirit world warriors tend to have it pretty awful in the romance department.  For example Shizuku Ninomiya, a rather attractive and personable (if slightly silly) spirit world warrior working as a teacher at the high school most of the characters attend gets dumped so often it has become a joke to her spirit world oblivious students.  Izumi Nase, effective head of the Nase clan of spirit world warriors goes so far as to counsel her younger sister, Mitsuki, to stay alone until she retires, something Izumi seems to be practicing herself, which has resulted in Mitsuki missing out on most normal childhood experiences with her ""normal"" peers.  In light of this, spirit world warrior Yayoi Kanbara producing a child with a youmu father doesn't seem all that inconceivable, in any sense of the word.Into this grim situation come our two main protagonists: Akihito Kanbara, the half human, half youmu product of said union and Mirai Kuriyama, the last living member of a cursed and nearly exterminated clan of spirit world warriors that use their own blood as a lethal weapon, and amazingly, joyously, they manage to hit it off, though naturally they are the last to know it.  Despite his fetish for glasses, her overuse of the phrase that translates to ""how unpleasant"", and an entire box full of screwball comedy romantic complications, not to mention all this spirit world business, they gradually, oh, so gradually fall in love, but is happiness even possible for them in this world where the greatest evil comes not from rampaging youmu but rather from the horrifyingly corrupt human mind and heart?Let's just say it comes to a satisfying ending IMHO,...or rather it SEEMS to....I've got to give the creators credit, they made a sincere effort to give those viewers who would rather stop here a seemingly happy ending, but the story isn't really happily ended, not by a long shot.  I'll give you one word:amnesia.Yes, it's the most overused trick in an author's toolbox, but it is used with great care and skill here.  If someone had lived a life filled with misery and regret, wouldn't said person be happier if it were now possible to live without all those sad memories?  Even if it meant you had to give up associating?  Even if you had been in love?  More importantly, do you have the right to make that decision for someone else?  All these questions are considered in a story that also ties up some loose ends from the TV show you might have forgotten about in the rush of the cataclysmic climax.  This is the plot of ""Beyond the Boundary: The Future"", the second of two movies produced after the series ended, the first ""Beyond the Boundary: The Past"", being a compilation film, and though watching the compilation is optional, watching the second really isn't if you would have a true happy ending.  Unfortunately, it is only available online at present, but hopefully Sentai Filmworks will eventually release it as well.  Interestingly, to a much greater extent than the TV series, it drives home a moral that works for spirit world warriors and normies alike: don't go it alone.  A burden shared is a burden eased whether you are talking about couples, families, or friends.  In a time when the increasing tendency is to get completely wrapped up in our own worlds with our own problems, that's good and perhaps even necessary advice.Note: All versions of this TV series complete collection include a prequel OAV Episode 0 that shows what happened when Akihito and the Nase family first met and 5 episodes of ""Beyond the Boundary Trial Idol!"" which amount to a self-parody.  I would recommend watching Episode 0 first, before the 12 regular episodes and then watching the 5 idol trial episodes afterwards because otherwise they will make no sense.  Finally, track down and watch ""Beyond the Boundary: The Future"".Note: When it comes to subtitles versus voice dubbing, I'm no purist; I'm willing to accept either though all things being equal I prefer dubbing to subbing so that I can watch what's showing on the rest of the screen easier.  However, all is not equal in this set.  For reasons I could only speculate upon, the subtitling is better, providing information the dubbing does not.  So if you would understand as much as possible about what is going on watch the subtitled version at least once, and pay attention.Note: The Collector's Edition comes with both Blu-ray and DVD discs, but basic sets are available a lot more cheaply in either Blu-ray or DVD only versions.  Of course you don't get the extra goodies in those, the most significant of which are those infamous red glasses, just perfect for collectors, cosplayers,... and perverts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISWO1FL71BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CVUXY4#wasThisHelpful","R2ISWO1FL71BW","A3BTL4FV6ODKAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BTL4FV6ODKAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

On the one hand, I love the way he works fascinating, occasionally obscure, historical events unexpectedly into his plots, on the other, I hate the way he comes up with amazing, world changing ideas, events, discoveries, and inventions...that never actually change the world, which is right back to where it was at the beginning of the next book.

Readers get a respectable 85 scenarios in 224 pages on all sorts of topics of varying degrees of likelihood, from how to survive ""someone who 'thinks outside the box' in meetings"" to how to survive an earthquake or a tsunami to how to survive a zombie attack or time travel, all delivered with the same serious-with-only-the-slightest-wink attitude.About the only nit to pick is the lack of a pocketable paperback edition; in many of these scenarios you are unlikely to have access to (or room for) either a bulky hardback or a Kindle edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZSRLAAZWCEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607520#wasThisHelpful","R3KZSRLAAZWCEG","A3BTL4FV6ODKAT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BTL4FV6ODKAT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is great storage for our pet food. I didn't even realize it came with the scoop. I missed that part so that was a cool surprise. The scoop is like a big measuring cup, with marks for 1/2 cup, 1 cup, etc. so you know how much food you're giving your pet.My only complaint is that the top bin doesn't lock on to the bottom bin. In order to get into the larger bin you'll have to remove the top every time or risk it falling off. There are, however, grooves so that the top bin settles against the lid of the bottom bin nicely. It does not lock on and can fall off if you push too hard when rolling the unit around.Overall I feel this storage unit is strong and sturdy. I like the wheels. I love the color (Blue Moon/Gray). Could use for so many other purposes other than pet food, too. We use the bottom bin for dog food and the top for cat food.

"I have been a Boppy user with five babies. My Boppy was used so much to the point I finally had to toss it. Well yay, baby #6 is on the way and I find myself trying to justify the cost of a $40 pillow that I won't use as often as I did when having the first five because this is likely our last child. I came across this NurSit pillow and I was REALLY hesitant to purchase. I noticed great reviews, the pics show a decent looking pillow so I decided to take the chance. I got the cloud print with removable pink cover.It arrived in a plastic bag, with rope handle, much like a Boppy. I noticed right away that the packaging states it is filled and finished in the USA with recycled and hypoallergenic material. This pillow is FULL and so plump. I haven't measured next to a Boppy but I think it is plumper than Boppy. Part of my hesitation to purchase this pillow, sight unseen, was because I did not want a flat pillow. I found that my Boppy was getting flatter and flatter over time. I need my nursing pillow to be nice and full; that's how I prefer it when nursing my baby (I see others left reviews in the negative for that but it's a positive in my book!). I do not want to have to lean over to reach baby when nursing. A plump pillow means baby is closer to my chest.The fabric itself is super soft. I feel that the fabric texture is definitely comparable to Boppy. One thing Boppy does have going for it is that they have more chic and modern prints. But you'll be covering up the print on this NurSit pillow anyway which leads me to..........My only issue - why is the print on the main body of the pillow, only to be covered up with a boring solid colored cover? That seemed odd to me. For the price this issue isn't a deal breaker whatsoever. I just found it a little backward.I will update my review when baby is here and I've actually used it for intended purposes (feeding baby).My first impressions lead me to leave a five-star review at this time! In fact if this pillow is everything I'm hoping and dreaming when I actually nurse baby I'll be getting a second pillow to keep on another floor of the house (I always forget to grab my pillow when going up and down the stairs all day!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3XYS9VVWJJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY5FHGW#wasThisHelpful","R3A3XYS9VVWJJ2","A312Y9ESLKYJJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A312Y9ESLKYJJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the way this toothpaste makes my mouth feel. I was using this same toothpaste but in the mint flavor BUT I prefer the cinnamon. So this review is specifically for the cinnamon flavored one. My mouth just feels cleaner when I use the cinnamon. It is a more expensive toothpaste compared to common brands but it's worth it to me when it comes to my oral health. My kids will use this one but the younger ones (under age 4) do complain that it is spicy if they get too much. So I do caution about that.

"These tests are pretty substantial and heavy duty. I normally use FRER but found this pack of Clearblue digitals for less money here on Amazon and with free Prime shipping. I am pretty loyal to something that I know works and I have never used these ""weeks estimator"" tests before. I have PCOS and have low progesterone in the first trimester, which can lead to miscarriage. Because of this I test every cycle, even though we were not actively trying to have a baby, because I have to get supplements to prevent miscarriage. This means I take a lot of pregnancy tests and price matters!Okay so that aside I took one of the tests mid-December. Due to longer cycles I was kind of guessing when I should test. It came up Not Pregnant. Later on in the month, on 12/29, I realized I still hadn't gotten a period. PCOS can cause irregularity and long cycles so I didn't actually suspect anything. I took the second test and surprisingly it popped up with Pregnant and 1-2 Weeks!!! I still cannot believe it, a month later.So I don't give this brand five stars because I got pregnant. I give five stars because 1). the tests are just really impressive with overall design and advanced technology, 2). they are accurate when used correctly, and 3). the price was right for a pack of three especially when they're so well made.I see a lot of reviews about how these tests fluctuate with the week estimations. Take that with a grain of salt, people. A lot can affect how much hCG is detectable in urine at the time of the test. Go by your blood tests and sonograms. The week estimation is not to take place of your medical professional nor indicate a problem (miscarriage, ectopic, etc.). Listen to your doctor/midwife and to your body if something feels wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYW0H58LN5LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D05VGC8#wasThisHelpful","R1VYW0H58LN5LU","A312Y9ESLKYJJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A312Y9ESLKYJJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never used an epilator. I liked the idea of it. But when I got it, plugged it in and turned it on... I just couldn't bring myself to use it. Those tweezers move FAST. And the thing is loud, like really loud. I have nothing to compare this particular one, too. Several days later I finally got brave, got it out and just did it. It hurts, I won't lie. It's not unbearable. I imagine it is very similar to getting a tattoo. After a few passes your skin starts to go a little numb. It takes some time, longer than shaving. I had to go over several areas more than once. I only did my calves. They immediately got red bumps ALL over. But by morning the red bumps were gone. It was just irritation.So back to the speed of these tweezers rolling around the barrels... it moves fast. I was terrified to set it against my skin! So the first calve that I did had way more irritation and red bumps because I was having to go over spots several times. By the time I got to my second calve I was more comfortable and was able to work faster and more efficiently.Overall I'm pleased with the results. I just barely have any stubble and it's been about five days since I first used it. I usually have stubble the NEXT day after shaving. As I use it more I expect the redness from irritation to lessen and lessen. Worth not having to shave for a week or two! I knocked off a star because I hate how loud it is (it annoyed everyone!).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8J0VNYCJQZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GS6OB4#wasThisHelpful","RQ8J0VNYCJQZ5","A312Y9ESLKYJJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A312Y9ESLKYJJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just got my phone case and it arrived the same day as my new 5c. I got a blue 5c and I'd say the blue of this pink&blue case are *almost* identical. As far as the case itself goes: the blue part is the silicone. I love silicone on my phone because I feel it absorbs the impact if the phone gets dropped, as opposed to a metal/wood/plastic case with no silicone. The pink part of this particular phone is the plastic that snaps together after you put the blue silicone on. It's a hard plastic but it looks like this slick metallic hot pink. It's awesome! It almost has this velveety feel to it, too. I'm going to be getting other colors so the blue of my 5c stands out around the camera and the apple logo. Very impressed and happy with my purchase thus far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US1V5Z3G360K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G24TLJY#wasThisHelpful","R1US1V5Z3G360K","A312Y9ESLKYJJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A312Y9ESLKYJJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just finished watching the movie. Highly disappointed. Nothing like the historical role models. Isabelle constantly scowled and looked forlorn, was very jealous of others instead of making an effort to better herself, spoke rudely and nastily to her sister and to a bully. Returning nastiness for nastiness is NOT okay in my book. Also, these AG girls are to be role models, using their hardships to provide other young girls with a moral compass to follow on the path to success and giving back to the community selflessly.What I expected and hoped for: a young girl who faced challenges but overcame them with poise and an admirable attitude. A girl who encouraged other young girls to keep on trying, even if you mess up again and again. I wanted a role model!That wasn't to be. The movie was 3/4 whining and drama. I also didn't appreciate the dances outside of the actual ballet classes/performance. They were moves that my young girls don't need to be imitating. I don't care if that is what is the ""norm"" now. It doesn't make it right. We'll be sticking to Molly, Samantha and the classics. This one is going in the trash. So unfortunate as my oldest daughter LOVES her Isabelle doll and is in ballet herself! We are using this video as a teaching tool on how NOT to act or react (quite the opposite of what the AG company has stood for until the making of this movie).","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQJWZ2X709XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAVPEZA#wasThisHelpful","R1UQJWZ2X709XM","A312Y9ESLKYJJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A312Y9ESLKYJJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is great! It looks exactly as pictured. Arrived safe and sound. I LOVE that the little guard on the front is a little taller (less chances for misses). It has little handles on the side. In the past we've had potty rings that had all these nooks and crannies and they'd get DISGUSTING. This is a simple, simple ring that is solid so it is much easier to clean. It came with a little hook, like a mini over-the-door hook except you put it on the toilet tank, under the lid. The hook part obviously hangs outside the toilet so you can pop the potty ring off the toilet seat and you have a place to put it OTHER than the floor (or tub or sink or wherever).One negative that I have is that my son cannot easily put this on the toilet himself, which is a big deal if he needs to go and I'm not immediately there to snap it on for it. It COULD be our specific toilet seat, though. But the ring snaps in and he has a hard time getting it on there. We cannot leave it on the toilet all the time because we are a 7-person family of all ages.

"These are awesome. They are crystal clear and you can cut right down the middle of a single laminated sheets without it coming apart (it will come apart if you laminate two sheets back-to-back and cut too close to the papers with lamination sticking to one side of each page). WARNING: Make sure you insert the page closed-side first. If you insert the open side then you will break your laminator. True story!

"Chihuahua loves these...too much!  She now wants to live on these and these alone (barks at the top of the refrigerator when I put her dog food down...asking me to give her one of these instead).  Some important things you may benefit by knowing:  not made in USA (and we have all become skeptical of anything made in China for dogs to eat, haven't we??).  Another problem: too many of these give my dog some digestive problems- we're not talking incontinence in the house or anything, just looser BMs.  I would have skipped buying them again in the future once I knew both of these things, but my dog is so picky that there isn't one other treat she will eat,...I've tried them all, and to her: these are 'the bomb' and that's that.  However, all of these considerations aside: if you want these for training treats (a great use that I would recommend them for, which will limit your dog's exposure to a foreign made treat) I bet you will not find a dog who won't do cartwheels for these.  Not recommended however, for a steady diet (due to concerns already mentioned).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4UJKLTAB4TRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003621V98#wasThisHelpful","R4UJKLTAB4TRW","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this product and here's how I use it: I keep it in the fridge for when I'm back from a 'sweat' inducing errand in the hot days of summer. When I come home, I spritz it on my bare arms for some cooling and for a touch of the lightest of scents.  (If I didn't wear makeup, I'd probably spritz my face as well!)  The scent is light enough that its nothing like using a cologne spray, nor does it interfere with other scents I may have on.  Its just a simple, lovely product with an ultra-light refreshing scent!

"A PERFECT sunhat!  After trying and using MANY hats for walking in the sun, here is why I've settled on this one as my all time favorite:  its super lightweight.  I didn't know how important that was until I wore a heavier one in the hot sun...ugh!  It feels like it keeps out the sun, but still allows a nice airflow.  Also- a GREAT size- the brim is wide enough to really provide shade.  I had a similar hat with a smaller brim that I liked, but I felt that my neck & decolletage were still getting beaten up by the sun!  Lastly, it won't necessarily wreck your hairdo- because its so lightweight.  Of course, if you work up a great sweat...can't promise anything regarding the inevitable 'hathead hairdo'!  All in all- I just LOVE this hat.  It does seem too pricey however, so that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars.

"Love these hooks, have found a million uses for them!  To help others I wanted to say why I buy these, versus ones with the little balls on the end (designed to protect fabrics), or the chrome color ones, etc.  These will hook into tiny spaces whereas those with the balled ends will not. You can dig these into a wreath, etc, for hanging, with minimal damage to the item (you don't need a big 'path' to fit the hook through).  They also will hold up to 40 lbs without bending.  So...if you are undecided about what S hooks to get, and are not a handyman (I'm not even a 'handywoman'!), then I'd  advise this way: buy black if you want the hook to be inconspicuous. Buy shiny chrome color if its going to be seen (as in hanging pots from a chrome rack), buy the ones with the balled edges if for fabrics or hanging kitchen tools (they will look nicer & will not prick a fabric like these ones might), and so on!  Just think about what you are going to use the hooks for, and then consider all the varieties of S hooks available.

Its also fairly substantial in weight and does not seem easy to cut off.

Some extra features: comes with stakes for when you are staking it to the soil over a plant.  The very top portion is an extra layer of sun shield, sides allow both sun and air to circulate.

"This collar far surpassed the hard collar I was given in the hospital following my surgery.  If you have to live in a hard collar for 6 weeks or so...that will seem like an eternity with other collars!!  Here's what special and makes this purchase worth it:  It has a much bigger opening for air flow where you don't need to have plastic- which means air can circulate and you won't be pouring down sweat every time you move!!  Its also designed so that it doesn' t press on your neck and esophagus (like my other collar did) when you lay down.  It also has replaceable pads for inside, which is great if you have to do walking exercise because you will sweat and oil up the original padding (of any type of hard collar!)  in no time.  And the knob for adjusting for neck length is simply invaluable!  If you have to live in a hard collar for a while, I definitely recommend that you treat yourself to this one.  It will make life much more bearable!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KH4FXNQB7SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006L8NBSS#wasThisHelpful","R28KH4FXNQB7SU","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This runner is made extremely well, with quality fabric that is thick & very pretty.  HOWEVER, its just too narrow.  Its not a standard runner width (see other reviews saying same thing, which I should have read first- plus I should have looked at the measurements and taken a ruler to compare).  If you have a small table (as pictured) and if its a French Country White, this runner would be ideal.  But for a standard dining room table, its just too narrow.  Also- I'm not sure if  you can see in the picture (because I missed it) but the print has some crystals and sparkles on it, which is quite pretty but I hadn't expected and it did not go with my decor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QIA0HGPBWYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UL8JS4K#wasThisHelpful","R21QIA0HGPBWYT","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Aeropostale clothes and this cami was no exception.  The material is soft, it has a built in bra (not very supportive however, but it keeps it from being see-through at the bust) and their  color selection is very broad.  About sizing: I usually buy UP a size with Aeropostale but with this cami, buy your regular size since its cut loose plus stretches a bit while you are wearing it.  One word on colors: I picked what I thought was a neon yellow, but it was a neon GREEN color when I recieved it- so pay attention to not only the color on your screen (there are several that look like the same shade of yellow, but they are all kinds of shades of neon yellow/green), but the color description as well.

"Great quality!  I saw that prism glasses generally range in price from about $7 to $29 dollars, so I read many reviews to understand why the broad price range.  This particular pair costs about $12.99 and is a great value for the following reasons: stable frame, not wobbly like the cheaper ones.  Wider prism and frame for better viewing too.  Really feel like a quality pair of glasses- some reviewers who bought the very pricier ones decided that these were actually better quality!  Good for using when needing to lie flat (or almost flat) to watch TV.  I just had neck surgery so this is what prompted my own decision.  Also good if you need to lay flat for any other reason (paralysis, treatments, back surgery, etc.)  Wanted also to advise, that if you never used prism glasses, they will take some getting used to. They are like the R side mirrors of many cars, where things appear smaller than they are, and further away. Also, you won't want to move your head alot when wearing them, or you'll likely get dizzy!  But if you lie still and give them a bit of time to get used to, you will probably eventually like them very much!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JN2IUC4NSD8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E94KYFO#wasThisHelpful","R1JN2IUC4NSD8A","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent decison to purchase this particular travel stool!  Its supportive, strong and lightweight...with built in carry strap.  Weighs just about 2 pounds but is sturdy enough to seat up to 250 pounds.  Plus biggest reason to select this particular brand/model is the height.  This one is a true 24 inches high when you sit on it. Some others have said they are 20-22 inches high but turned out to be about 18 inches when sat on (from the reviews people have offered).  May not seem like much difference, but very hard on knees to get up & down off just 18 inches!  So... I definitely recommend this brand based upon quality, price, portability for hiking, for the accurately stated sitting height and the very light weight of it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FWRQ7ZIAXO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019N36B2#wasThisHelpful","R8FWRQ7ZIAXO1","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always try to help with the purchasing decision of others, so here goes:  I kept hearing about WEN and wondered if it was hype or good products.  So I decided to try this spray because I have thin hair that needs volumizing all the time.  How I use it is that I spray it on my finished hairdo.  It brings out the curl and adds volume. But it IS slightly sticky/stiff, like regular hairspray-  but on the light side. That may sound like a bad thing, but it means skipping additional hairspray and it does help you hold a style (besides being a volumizer).  Although I like this product and am happy with it,  I only gave this product 4 stars because 1) its so pricey and 2) I bought the cheapest scent and it actually smells AWFUL (scent called: sweet almond mint).  However, the scent goes away pretty quickly and that's a good thing! I recommend for thin hair that needs volumizing (like mine!) or for thick straight hair where you want to combat natural oil & increase texture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8DOZ6PC7356/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI4UPJG#wasThisHelpful","RM8DOZ6PC7356","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I try to think of the things to share that might help others in their purchasing decision: the most important being that this particular 'jacket' is  REALLY lightweight and thin, slightly transparent even, and its runs SMALL (order UP at least one size!).  Its very casual, and even though most hoodies are casual, this one is even more so (has that well-washed look & feel).  I would recommend it for: a soft pajama/workout/round the house top,  or for when you want something really light to tie around your waist in case the weather cools off a bit later in the day when you are out hiking or walking or heading home from the gym.  AND...once I received the first one and knew what to expect, I actually ordered it again in other colors.  (I live in a HOT climate most of the year, so lightweight is good!).

"Depends on what you're looking for!  This is a very thin, lightweight 'sweater', perfect for the warmer weather here in S. California.  Its thin and lightweight, so I feel it might be necessary to wear a coordinating bra underneath!  However, its very pretty. A nice true Navy & white, soft fabric, and a shortish, boxy cut.  You can expect it to fit just below the waist (picture an inch shorter than it appears in the picture). Also- since it was so inexpensive, I ordered a size UP and was glad I did.  It was really hard to pick a number of stars, because while it wasn't what I expected (lighter weight, boxier), I really liked it all the same!

"Here's why I purchased this particular charger so maybe I can help with your purchasing decision too:  The pro's: tiny, nearly lipstick size (but heavier, of course!), color choices are vibrant (making it easy to locate), worked exactly as described for charging my S5; priced fairly for the amount of charge you get, handy to have for that time when you realize you forgot to charge your device!  (How is it that even though I can charge things at home, in the car, and at work...that STILL I seem to need to keep a little portable charger on hand?)  It works with any device that has a mini USB port (and it comes with the cord that you need to connect it with).  And you can use your device while its charging (just give it about 2 minutes or so, first)  I saw that it has very good ratings here and elsewhere, so I didn't have to worry too much about whether this item would be reliable.  Con's: wish it had a bigger capacity (there are chargers out there that do, but they're bigger in size and cost more), and wish it had bars to tell you how much charge was left.  Also wish the carrying case was a bright metallic color (even just silver!) like the device, otherwise the black case defeats the purpose of picking a bright colored device for ease of finding in one's purse or carry-on (you can put it in your purse with no cover, but in my purse...that's a risky venture!)

"I'll try to help everyone with a purchasing decision regarding a starter waist training corset (which is what I wanted): this one is stylish enough that I don't feel like I look too vampy if I go out with it on over a black tank top (I like to wear cotton under it for comfort). So- if you are looking for really sexy/flashy, this is not the one to get. This is a REAL waist trainer (albeit inexpensive and perhaps won't last that long...that remains to be seen so I'll update you in the future too!)  Now for the most important advice: how to pick a size and get it ON.  I returned the first ones I ever got because I thought they were way too small. Turns out I didn't understand HOW to get them on & laced, and THAT is everything!!!  So- measure your waist and order a size that will go to 4inches SMALLER.  Don't get distracted by a label size of 2XL when you never wore larger than a size 14-16, for example.  Go by the inches stated in the sizing!!  The idea is to REALLY loosen the ties to wide open, and then put it on and get the front snapped, and then cinch the ties inward (by pulling cord at each level behind your back, which you may need a mirror to do at first).  Important: if it fits right away with almost no work- you probably have gotten one way too big and it won't work for 'waist training'!  Expect it to be a JOB getting it on and cinched the first time!!  (But I promise it will get much easier in a very short amount of time).  Last bits of advice: there are MANY videos online and waist training books, etc that you really should look at before deciding the type & size to order. And beware of any corset really that's cheaper than this one- steel boning is more expensive than plastic and works better too.  You need to know that a REALLY good corset will cost upwards of $150- but I'm not ready for that yet (want to see how committed I am to waist training first!) and you are probably not either.  P.S. I do think only the front 'bones' are metal, and in a really high end waist trainer, they are ALL steel.  That's why I gave it only 4/5 stars- but I really wish I could have picked 4.5 stars- because you can't beat this corset for the price!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UN73NLVFML48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1IGXSY#wasThisHelpful","R3UN73NLVFML48","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always try to think about what might help the next buyer make a good purchase decision so here goes:  these pants are lightweight but still warm.  The material is really different, very smooth but not shiny.  Extremely comfortable!  I would recommend these pants for: workouts, hikes, or any casual roundabout wear.  Some things to consider: they are very LONG.  Fortunately, I'm tall (5'7"").  They do have an elastic at the bottom but its very loose so certainly if you are  5'3"", and under, I would not recommend these pants for you.  (They feel like cotton, but are polyester- so do not count on any shrinking in the dryer!)  Another thing to consider is that I would say these pants run slightly small.  Therefore I would recommend buying one size UP (I listened to other reviews that made same recommendation and I'm glad I did!).

One recommendation (which I did) is that you take a ruler and be CERTAIN  you know what size they are before ordering, as other sizes are also available.  I used them for: repairing costume jewelry (silver color) earrings, sterling jewelry, adding charms, even linked a few together as an extender.

"A great hair excessory!  Not sure why some others didn't like, but I'm guessing that it takes some experience to figure out how to use these well.  If you have a lot of hair- or really need height that spans the width of the top of your head, I recommend that you buy TWO of these (and maybe one to spare, as I stepped on one of mine and broke it!).  I find them: easy to use, fun to play with, replace having to tease my hair AT ALL, and stay in well with a tiny spritz of hair spray.  These were popular in Joan Crawford's day, when a big role on each side of your head was pinned in place (a look I sometimes do, but modified a bit).  No issues with this product whatsoever, it is what it is!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAIFDJATHK9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MN789QK#wasThisHelpful","R1IAIFDJATHK9A","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised to not like this dress as I have many pieces in the Sakkas clothing line and usually love how they fit.  This one is boxy on top and not very flattering.  I know that many have given it excellent reviews, so I'm guessing it may have to do with one's dress size- so I'll try to help others decide whether to buy. I'm a 14/16 (closer to 14) and it fit very well, it just wasn't flattering.  It didn't go in at the waist like the picture (like the model in the picture is pinching the waist fabric behind her to make it more shapely).  I'm 5'7 and length was great, so was the print of the fabric.  I'm also a 38C and although the bust fit fine (its nice and stretchy on top), I thought it looked frumpy and not shapely on top.  So in summary I'm going to guess that this dress may be most flattering (after reading other reviews) for sizes 8-12 only.  One other thing (that I like to put in all my Sakkas reviews): the reason for the reasonable pricing of their line is that even though their colors and prints are gorgeous, these cotton items are VERY fragile to wash (they run, can't be put in dryer, need cold water TLC when washing and a press cloth when ironing, etc).  So if you like 'durable', their line is not it- but if you like clothes/dresses that are: inexpensive, fun, GREAT colors/prints and are cut exceptionally well (usually!) with a lovely forgiving/flattering drape to most of their styles- Sakkas does it very well!  I recommend that you check out many of their other dresses if this is not the one for you!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3476L3XR63QWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEMOYJ8#wasThisHelpful","R3476L3XR63QWJ","AEJNWMXJS818O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEJNWMXJS818O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It seems like entitlement is an attitude that is on the rise. It's the attitude that one is exempt from responsibility and is owed special treatment. Townsend makes it clear he is not writing about those who are truly in need, are incapable, or who are lacking skills. He is writing about the person capable of taking care of him or himself yet expects others to do that.Townsend says he has written this book primarily to help those who struggle with entitlement disease. He suggests we all struggle with it a bit, what he calls pocket entitlement. There is a solution, he writes, called the Hard Way. It's “the habit of doing what is best, rather than what is comfortable, to achieve a worthwhile outcome.” He has good insights into the outcomes of following this path, how change starts at a tipping point, and includes really practical suggestions on how to get and keep going on this Hard Way path.This book is also good for someone in relationship with one having entitlement disease. He advises compassion, helping us understand what causes entitlement. He also has great suggestions on how to communicate, such as the appropriate way to give praise. He also suggests ideas that gives the best chance of making a difference in another's life. He helps us see if we are actually enabling the entitlement behavior.I was a little skeptical when starting this book, wondering if it would not only identify the disease and its symptoms, but offer a cure. I was happy to find out that Townsend has included practical strategies for the person suffering from entitlement disease and for those who deal with them. Many of his chapters have “skills” at the end which are questions, suggestions, and challenges centered on the chapter information.I highly recommend this book to those who feel entitled and to those who need to relate to them. You'll come to understand what causes the entitlement disease and receive very practical ideas to deal with it. If you or a loved one feels trapped in an attitude of entitlement, this book will help get you on the path to a successful and fulfilled life.Food for thought: “It's as simple as this: If you want to get somewhere meaningful in life, you need a relationship with pain. You must understand how to use and experience your own pain in ways that get you where you want to go.”I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVP0SU4Q4KDU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5W5GKW#wasThisHelpful","RVP0SU4Q4KDU7","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enlow has had a number of visions and words from the Lord as to how Christians are to manifest the kingdom of God in the seven primary spheres of society. He related that information in his earlier books, The Seven Mountain Prophecy and The Seven Mountain Mantle. Now he writes what he expects to take place in the next thirty five years.He expects the coming years to be an Era of Renaissance. As the first Renaissance showcased man's achievements, this one will display God before the watching world. There will be such a great increase in the knowledge of God and His ways that life on earth will be changed forever. (25)Christians are usually presented with two options when it comes to society: 1) fight to go back to our godly roots, or 2) hunker down. Enlow presents another way: bringing God's solution to our broken lives and broken society. He sees Christians demonstrating God's goodness and advancing His kingdom. He sees Christians interacting with people, helping them realize how much God cares for their hearts.He sees this leading to personal and cultural transformation in the seven primary spheres of society: religion, education, family government, economy, media, and celebration/arts. I'll highlight a few of his expectations.Religion: Enlow sees a clear trend away from John Calvin and toward George Fox. There needs to be a recognition that the Spirit is greater than the Word (Bible). (68) There will be an increasing knowledge of God as churches find more ways to reveal who He is, how He works,  and to display His love to society. (More on this religion aspect below.)Government: “The best is yet to come in American government. By 2020, we will have a real stronghold of righteousness in play that will progressively and positively affect government in this nation – and the world as a whole. By the year 2030, we will be manifesting the highest level of governance ever known.” (217)Economy: “Over the next twenty years, there will be an explosion of kingdom multimillionaires all over the globe.” (221) Enlow gives a five step “miracle-grow” formula for financial provision.Celebration/Arts: Hollywood is going to become “Holywood.” “This isn't simply over-the-top, wishful thinking but a future reality.” (260)Enlows comments about the future of education are a little troubling. He writes, “...[W]e were designed by birth and wiring to be right brain dominant. The left brain was designed to be complementary and to assist the right brain.” (104) There is no footnote to support this statement and an Internet search I did provided no supporting evidence. Right handed people are left brain dominant and that seems to be somewhere between 84 to 95 percent of humans. Since this right brain issue is foundational to his expectations in education, I am leery about his proposed future.I was disappointed with his writing about religion. He makes inflammatory statements an unsubstantiated claims about John Calvin. For example, “Calvin was responsible for executing at least a hundred people...” (43) That is just not true. The two footnotes listed mention the one man executed, Servetus, and mention no others. Again, “...[Calvin] personally oversaw the execution by drowning of Anabaptist ministers, as well as the execution of scores of other believers who disagreed with his views.” (56) That is just not true. Enlow provides no footnote this time. I did some research and found that, “Servetus was the only person put to death for religious opinions during Calvin’s time in Geneva, even though executions for heresy were common elsewhere.” (You can find the source here.)https://jamespruch.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/was-john-calvin-a-heretic-burning-maniac/The sad part about his writing on Calvin is that it violates Enlow's own method for showing God's love. He writes, “Finger-pointing could never be considered a correct portrayal of how Jesus would respond to people if He were walking the earth today.” (185) Yet that is what he has done with Calvin.I can tell Enlow hates Calvinistic theology. He makes some pretty harsh statements about it. He calls predestination a “horrendous” doctrine, “which turns God into a megalomaniacal monster.” (60) He describes Calvinism as “believing in a God who is not merciful, or just, or humane but who rather cold-heartedly sticks to an arbitrary plan, assigning lives of comfort to some and horrible existence to others.” (65) As a Charismatic Calvinist, that hurts. In all my reading of books critical of of Calvinism, I have never read statements so inflammatory and so full of misunderstanding.Even though I am Charismatic, I don't like Enlow's elevation of the Spirit (prophecy today) above the written Word (Bible). I've heard many “prophets” prophesy many things that did not come true. Enlow himself says, “Many Christians have wrongly prophesied America's demise because of the removal of prayer from the public schools.” (117) There needs to be a standard by which to judge prophecies and that would be the Word. Enlow shows how important the Bible is when he says sex must necessarily be inside “His guidelines” and “God's boundaries.” (143) Those guidelines and boundaries come from the Bible, not a current prophetic word.I have mixed feelings about this book. I like his attitude that the kingdom of God is advanced by influence and not by imposition. The problem is whether there are people of influence in each of these seven areas and whether they will do the influencing work. His unsubstantiated comments about the right brain dominance will probably alienate many educators. His inflammatory language about Calvinism will probably alienate many Christian intellectual, as it did me. As with any prophetic book, time will tell.I received a complimentary copy of this book through The Book Club Network for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRB2119CU9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629115568#wasThisHelpful","R3FRB2119CU9N","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every time I read one of Rubart's novels, he makes me think so much my brain spins. I'm sure this is his best novel yet.Brock, co-owner of a very successful coffee company in the Pacific Northwest, kept having a dream about his father that troubled him greatly. Needing advice, he talked to his good friend Morgan who gave him a book about lucid dreaming. Perhaps Brock could dream again and this time change the outcome.Brock dreams. He dreams he converses with his younger self. He can give his younger self advice and perhaps correct the wrong choices he's made. Maybe he can change the future – or can he?This is a very thought provoking novel. Besides being a well written novel with an intriguing plot and interesting characters, it presents a view of reality that is full of questions. How much of our reality today is a result of our choices and how much is the work of God? Are we living the life we were designed to live? Are there choices we can make today, this moment, that can direct us back to the path we were meant to be on? Does God somehow dwell in the past, present, and future all at once?There are many lessons one can learn from this novel. One that really impressed me was a realization of the importance of the opportunities for personal connection. Perhaps we brushed someone off who wanted to talk. Brock saw the results of some of those choices, but we may never know the ramifications of such a choice we made.Another lesson that stood out was living in the present, not being bound by the past nor threatened by the future. There is also the concept of having a victim mentality. This novel showed so well the results of choices we make, we have to consider the truth that much of our situation today is from our own choosing. And then there are all the choices God has placed before us. He gives us options every day and it is for us to make the best of every moment. Perhaps the greatest lesson of all is submission to God and His design for our life.This is an amazing novel. It may not be perfect, as I felt a few too many loose ends were left at the last page. Nonetheless, the novel has such an impact that a minor issue like that is easily overlooked.I highly recommend this novel. But hang on to your chair as your brain will soon be spinning with the interaction of what is and what might have been. I did not see the discussion questions in the egalley I read although space was left for them.

"The first day Kevin West saw the shabbily dressed stranger enter his grocery store, he had no  idea this man would change his life. This book is a well written account of that unlikely friendship.West had been a successful vice president of a bank when, in 1998, he resigned, having made fraudulent loans. He had drifted far from his faith and his pursuit of success had driven him to illegal banking practices. Waiting for his indictment and trial, he spent the time managing the small grocery store he had bought in Ironton, Ohio, as an investment. At a low ebb, he cried out to God. The answer came in the form of an elderly and unkempt man named Don.This is a fascinating story of an unlikely friendship, one that changed both of the men. There are many lessons to learn from this book. A major one is how we look at other people. Many of us would have written Don off as a homeless panhandler, never thinking God might have something for us to learn from him. We are taught that there is value in every person and each one of them has a story.I was impressed with the biblical teaching included within the development of the story. Don has a surprising insight into Scripture and an amazing amount of spiritual wisdom. We learn a lesson on brokenness and honesty. We read about our trying to project the image we think others want of us. We see the difference between intellectually accepting forgiveness and actually living out that forgiveness emotionally.The story is a lesson on God's plan for our lives. Kevin had to experience the pain and hurt his actions caused in those he loved the most. He also had to realize that God's path for him included prison as part of his growth journey. Yet, because of his interaction with Don and his desire to deepen his faith, Kevin prospered in prison where God used him mightily. His marriage was preserved and strengthened and he received the support of friends and relatives.I recommend this story as a good one showing how God may use the very unusual to influence our lives. Who would have thought that a man smelling of uncleanness and dressed in tattered clothes would be the one to spiritually mentor an ex-bank vice-president? It is a good reminder to be open to those around us and see them as God does.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D35PWPL6CXSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI5UC#wasThisHelpful","R1D35PWPL6CXSG","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a huge fan of Amish or Mennonite novels but I really do like the Finding Sanctuary series by Nancy Mehl. Sanctuary, Missouri is a town where conservative and progressive Mennonites, as well as those not Mennonite at all, live together. And another feature, not all of the Mennonites are perfect. That makes for a style of fiction I really enjoy.Our main character in this novel is Sophie Wittenbauer. She was raised in a strict Mennonite home in Kingdom but left as soon as she was eighteen. She had been terribly mistreated by her father and made some poor choices herself. She's now a new reporter at a newspaper. Wanting to move beyond her entry level reporting jobs, she aspires to that one story that will make her career.When she overhears office chatter about a possible lead in a decades old robbery and murder, she decides this is her big chance. She knows the convict who sent the letter to the newspaper. He had overheard one of the murderers mention Sanctuary as a place to hide out. Sophie takes some time off, creates a likely reason for her visit, takes on a new name, and heads to the small Missouri town.Imagine her surprise when one of the first people she meets is Jonathon, the young man she loved as a troubled teenager back in Kingdom. He's now the pastor of an evangelical church in Sanctuary. He doesn't recognizer her at first although he is puzzled by his inner feelings toward her. She still loves him but knows he could never still love her – not after all that had happened.I love this town of Sanctuary. It's a place where the Mennonite and evangelical churches get together for dinners, where the pastors are good fishing buddies, and where people look out for each other. It is also the place where a murderer can hide out with some anonymity. Before too long, Sophie's probing investigation stirs up trouble. Will she be able to identify the murderer before it's too late? Will Jonathon stay by her side and help her?We meet some great (and not so great) characters in Sanctuary. There are no hotels in Sanctuary so Sophia stays with Esther, an elderly woman and my favorite. What a dear – and she is much smarter than Sophie anticipates. We get reacquainted with others of the town we've met in previous novels in the series too.One of the themes running through this novel is getting beyond a troubled religious past. It is hard for Sophie to go to Sanctuary. She has to keep reminding herself it is not Kingdom, with its bad memories. There is much she must overcome, including a dismissal of God as caring for her. I really like it that Mehl has made Sophie's conservative Christian background very realistic. Readers with a less than ideal childhood in a conservative Christian setting will certainly identify with Sophie.Another issue in the book is Sophie's drive to be a successful crime reporter. Surrounded by wonderful people, and a potential beau, Sophie has to rethink her priorities. I kept hoping she'd make the right choice.I highly recommend this novel. There is good suspense, a wonderful community through which the story flows, great characters, and some lessons to learn about living. This is the third book in a series but reads very well on its own.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQ6JTUE57DOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012H0ZU46#wasThisHelpful","R2DQ6JTUE57DOK","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember hearing about the Dust Bowl in U.S. History class. I may have even read a novel or two about it. But Finkbeiner brings it alive like I've never seen before.The story is mostly told through the eyes of ten year old Pearl. Her daddy is the sheriff of Red River, Oklahoma. It's 1934 and the dust blows through the dying town. Some have stayed, trying to make a living. The poor ones live in dugouts outside of town.I really liked seeing the world through Pearl's eyes. There are serious events that take place in the novel. It is a devastating time for many and some do desperate acts. Tragedy is frequent. Hobos and poor families stop in the area, on their way to find a promised new life in California. One of them is a man with a deadly agenda.And we see it all through the innocent eyes of Pearl. Even as her parents try to shelter her from the difficult events of the time, she comes to be at the center of a revenge that would affect her whole family. I held my breath as it looked like Pearl's world would fall apart and be changed forever.I liked Pearl's family. With an employed father, they have more money than most in the town. It was heartening to see her mother's giving heart toward those less fortunate. It was heartbreaking to see those who so desperately needed her gifts.A main issue that comes through in the novel is that of parenthood. Who is your real parent, the one who birthed you or the one who cared for you your whole life? Another issue is the one of nature verses nurture. Does your DNA prescribe who you are or the environment in which you were raised?Another issue revolves around God, sin and judgment. The preacher claimed the lack of rain was God's judgment on the people's sin. That brought back memories of prominent preachers who claimed the same about hurricane Katrina's devastation on New Orleans.A prominent theme running through the story is the idea of one sacrificing a great deal for the life of another. While the action in the novel was on a human level, I couldn't help but think of how Jesus sacrificed so much so we could live. The price Pearl's parents were willing to pay for her life and well being because of their love for her is a good illustration of our Father's love for us.I highly recommend this novel. It's not easy to read. Oh, it's very well written. It is just that the subject matter portrays desperate people living through a very hard time. Finkbeiner has done an excellent job of taking us right into their tragic world. There is a good discussion guide to help reading groups work through the many issues in this good novel.In an Afterword, Finkbeiner says at the age of sixteen, she read The Grapes of Wrath. She felt compelled to learn more about the Dust Bowl. For nineteen years she found out all she could about this period in history, writing short stories, leading discussions. This novel is the culmination of her work. The end of the story is left open and I hope there is a sequel.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOMQ41O4U3KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443881#wasThisHelpful","R3BOMQ41O4U3KV","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dieting is a $60 billion annual industry in America. Johansen wants readers to know the truth about fad diets. She presents some tried and true strategies with easy to follow guidelines based on scientific fact.I had no idea how big the diet industry had become. But then, two-thirds of Americans are overweight. The American Medical Association labeled obesity a disease in 2013.She takes us through a history of dieting and then popular ones in the last years, including fad diets (ones that predict rapid weight loss). I was surprised in her report on food allergies and the current gluten-free craze. Only three percent of people have a true food allergy. She reminds us of some of the possible damage some of these diets can do to our bodies.Her strategy is really common sense. The calorie intake must be less than the calorie outgo to lose weight, although we are not to go under 1,200 calories a day without medical supervision. We need to cut 500 calories a day to lose about a pound a week. She suggests 15-20% protein, 45-50% carbohydrates, 30% fat. Her plate is a nine inch one with half full of non-starchy vegetable, a quarter full of starchy vegetables, and a quarter of lean protein. Fruit and non-fat or low-fat dairy are outside the plate. She suggests the USDA Choose My Plate website as a resource. The USDA also has a free food tracker at their site.I really liked her graphics for portion sizes. A golf or ping pong ball is the size of a two tablespoon serving of peanut butter. A CD is the serving size for a pancake. Those illustrations have inspired me to check the serving sizes on labels a bit more closely.She has good information on fiber, including her suggestion of eating unprocessed carbohydrates, and hydration. She also walks us through understanding the current food nutrition labels. She doesn't let us forget the necessity of exercise either.I appreciated her “why we eat” section. That was enlightening, as was her goal setting suggestions. She has included an Appendix of trusted resources too.There is no amazingly new or revolutionary material in this book. I do recommend it to those who are thinking of beginning a fad diet, something promising quick weight loss. I really appreciate the tried and true method that Johansen suggests. The book is a good reminder of what really works for weight loss and good health in the long term.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNPKQ5NFEECB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012PMFDG6#wasThisHelpful","R2UNPKQ5NFEECB","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I pick up a novel by Raney I know it is going to be an emotional one. This one is no exception, so get your box of tissues handy.We've followed the various Whitman family members in this series. We were with the parents, Grant and Audrey, when they turned their home into the Chicory Inn and Landyn came home unexpectedly, her marriage falling apart. We were with Corinne and Jesse when he was wrongly accused of harassment by a disgruntled employee.This novel centers on the middle daughter, Danae, and her husband Dallas. They have been trying for years to have a child but with no success. It is hard to read about Danae's heartbreak when the family gets together, especially since her sister is pregnant – again. And Dallas will not even talk about adoption. The years of fertility treatments have taken a toll on their marriage.Desperate to get her mind on something else, Danae volunteers at a new women's shelter in town. The battered woman she meets there forever changes the lives of Danae and Dallas.This novel is full of emotional themes. Dallas was adopted and his bad experience shades his thoughts about the possibility of him and Danae adopting. The problem is that he has not been open with Danae, telling her his entire story. Ultimately he comes to the point of realizing complete openness with his wife may be the only way he will really heal.Another emotional issue is the idea of open adoption. The thought that the birth mother could change her mind almost seems beyond what adoptive parents should be called to endure.The whole concept of infertility is a heart breaker. It was hard to read about the family times, Danae's little nieces running around and Danae enduring the scene with such longing for a child of her own.

"This is the second book in Calhoun's dystopian Stone Braide Chronicles.At the end of Thunder, Selah had finally found her real father. She and the others had escaped from the Mountain but still had work to do. Selah wants to be reunited with her mother and younger brother. When evidence is found that they have been taken to the Mountain, Selah wants to go back there and rescue them. To add to the drama, Selah's father indicates that something terrible will happen to Selah in nine months if they cannot find The Third Protocol. Unless Glade can find a way west through the mountains, Selah will fragment – her brain and physical functions will fall apart.We learn a bit more about the post-apocalyptic world Selah inhabits. The native Landers were once ordinary humans who had left the Mountain before the great disaster. They changed afterward, somehow taking on incredible powers. We also find out that Selah, as the novarium, has elements in her blood that some think might heal or produce immortality.Traveling back to the Mountain is dangerous. There are splinter groups that would like to capture Selah and sell her to the highest bidder. Even some who appear to want to protect Selah are traitors. We meet some interesting people too, such as those who live in trees. I felt this part of the novel was a bit slow and did not move the plot forward well.Much of the action in this novel takes place back in the Mountain. I found that lack of description frequently detracted from my appreciation of the action. There is plenty of action but I had difficulty visualizing it. The group travels within the Mountain to cities with different color designations but I was unclear what made them different. Even within the Mountain there are many factions and people warring against each other.One aspect of the plot that I got tired of was the animosity between Glade and Bodhi. It just seemed they would argue, come to terms, repeat.Selah is an interesting heroine. There were times when she was amazingly effective while other times she was nearly overwhelmed. I had to keep reminding myself she was an eighteen year old developing superhuman powers and then her actions generally made sense and are appropriate for this young adult fiction.I enjoyed this book in the series. I am still looking for some “Christian” or otherwise redemptive aspect to the book. There is mention of future good and evil so I trust it is coming in the sequel.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28OLU5MEQXB64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGKP4#wasThisHelpful","R28OLU5MEQXB64","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knowing about God is not the same as being intimately connected with God. Hardin challenges us to rethink what we know about God and how we relate to Him. It's a great book.Hardin helps us understand what a relationship with God isn't, what we might need to give up, and what it could be – the missing puzzle pieces that complete our lives.We believe God exists, that He loves us and wants a relationship with us. We believe we should likewise want a relationship with Him. But who is this God and how do we discover Him in a personal way?I really appreciate Hardin's honesty about the difficult aspects of a relationship with God. One area is our confusion regarding God's role in our lives. We may feel He has let us down. That's hard to get over.I was surprised at Hardin writing that we must feed our starving soul from the inside out. The relationship must be cultivated from within. He suggests we invite God into every thought, word and deed in our lives. God is woven into the very fabric of who we are as believers.I am very impressed with this book. It really spoke to me and my desire to have a vital connection with God. I was relieved to find out that reading the Bible isn't enough. That will increase our knowledge of God but developing an intimate relationship is something that must come from the inside of us.I highly recommend this book. It is life transforming. Having an intimate connection with God and how that comes about finally made sense to me.Food for thought from Hardin: “I want to be ruined for anything less than a life-giving connection to God. Don't you?”I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ5GSLQ7UMWLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCENSAS#wasThisHelpful","RJ5GSLQ7UMWLJ","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a delightful story about a special dog that turns out to be quite a match maker. But before he was a match maker, he was a criminal.We first hear about the stray as he is swiping a chew bone from the local grocery store. The patient dog knows just when to sneak through the automatic door, trot down to aisle five, and snag a chew bone from the bottom bin. He's out the door in a flash midst the yelling of the manager.Stewart Coolidge, political science college graduate but current grocery store employee, is assigned the dangerous task of chasing the dog. Day after day the clever dog outwits his would be captors. Imagine Stewart's surprise when he sees the dog by his apartment. Stewart takes him in. That helps him get to know, Lisa, the beautiful young woman in the apartment below. A journalism major now making lattes submits a story to the local paper. Soon the dog is famous and a reward is offered. Even as Steward and Lisa are getting to know each other better, their lives become quite complicated.I love this well written dog story. Lisa names the stray Hubert and he is a dear. He likes to listen to Scripture being read. That's a good thing for Stewart who has abandoned the faith his grandmother taught him. Hubert is such an intelligent dog, he knows better what Stewart and Lisa need than they do. Stewart and Lisa are great characters. Stewart is kind of clueless about romance and life in general and Hubert helps him in so many ways. It is just sweet.This is a great novel about damaged people being loved into wholeness by a stray dog, a dog with the scars of mistreatment on his back. It is a good reminder that God may have unusual means to get us where He wants us to be.Can a dog understand faith and trust and who God is? I don't know, but it sure makes for a delightful novel.

"This is an extraordinary memoir. It is a story of God's grace and power in a young man's life when he was so discouraged he no longer wanted to live.David Ring was born dead. He remain dead for eighteen minutes. His mother cried out to Jesus and finally, a nurse noticed movement.But the time without oxygen to his brain left David with cerebral palsy. His life was harder than I can imagine. His parents separated when David was still young. Then his mother died when he was fourteen. The youngest of his seven siblings, only one sister would take him in.The book opens with David having arrived in Liberty, Missouri, and his new school. On his first day at the bus stop, he's made fun of. David Wideman came to his rescue and that was the beginning of a life long friendship.This book is an amazing account of David Ring's high school years. We experience the trials and the victories he had. While living in his sister's house, he was terribly mistreated by his sister's friend. He became so depressed he attempted suicide. Because of his friend David, there came a time when he entered a church and found the truth that gave him a reason for living.This book is so well written, it feels like a novel. John Driver wrote the book as David Spring's limitations in verbal and motor skills precluded writing it himself. Driver writes, “this book is a work of nonfiction with ribbons of fictitious elements running throughout.” (250) The basic framework of David's teenage experiences were augmented with added minor characters and events. That serves to make a very readable and inspiring story.This account of David Spring rising above his disabilities through the power of God is amazing. Upon hearing his story while still a teen, his high school psychology teacher said, “I guess for the first time in my life, I see something in someone else that makes me want to believe in something bigger than myself.” (226) That first telling of his story was the beginning of a speaking career that has inspired thousands.I highly recommend this book. It is such an inspiring story and it is very well written.

"“We have an awe problem,” Tripp writes. We are hard wired for awe. God created us that way. Our focus is to be on the beauty of God but other kinds of awe have captured our heart. We need to refocus our wondering heart on God again and again for nothing else will satisfy.“God intentionally loaded the world with amazing things to leave you astounded.” Tripp says God created us with the ability to take in that awe and pursue it. The awe we pursue controls our thoughts and emotions and shapes the direction of our life.Tripp helps us determine the awe we pursue. We will always be dissatisfied if our pursuit is not for the awe found in God. All other awe was created to point us to God.There is a war going on for what will rule our pursuit. Sin replaces our worship of God with worship of self. Tripp argues that our wrong pursuit is at the root and source of every evil thing we think, say, and do. He shows us in Scripture how this war is being waged. Reading Isaiah 40 is the beginning of getting on the right path again.Tripp has nailed it. He reveals the true source of our disappointment, our hurt, our anger, our frustration. Our emotions reveal what has captured our awe, as does our complaining. We will not find what we are looking for in created things, yet we keep looking, keep trying.I highly recommend this book to every Christian. Tripp has a special section for pastors and another for parents, but this book is for all Christians who want to understand the longing and how it is rightly filled. He writes, “...only when your heart is satisfied in him can you be free of looking for spiritual satisfaction in the fleeting pleasures of the physical world.”I recommend this book to anyone who is seeking personal happiness and fulfillment and has not found it. Tripp has great insight into our condition and that for which we so desperately seek. May we seek to have hearts captured by the awe of God. Reading this book helps us understand how to focus on that which truly fills us.Food for thought: “Only when awe of God progressively replaces awe of self will we joyfully, willingly, and consistently live as God designed us to live.”I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UMZRN0ZWWF8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R0KN8Q#wasThisHelpful","R1UMZRN0ZWWF8D","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel begins his book by noting that, while Americans are quite religious compared to Europeans, their knowledge is lacking. He shows that, not only is their knowledge of other faiths lacking, but knowledge of their own. “It is clear to me,” he writes, “American Christians are long overdue for a great awakening of the mind.” The next revival, he says, must be one awakening intellectual Christianity.With that opening, I had high hopes for this book. I was disappointed to find that Daniel's idea of such an awakening is to accept the opinions of contemporary thought as shaping our understanding of biblical truth.As a Christian on the conservative side, I would not describe this book as a rigorously intellectual one. Daniel gives many anecdotes and survey results to “prove” his case, but he does not explore the various Scriptures that conservative Christians look to for direction. For example, on his writing about the LGBT community, he does not address, let alone even mention, those troubling Scriptures with which truly thinking Christians must struggle. In his discussion on Islam, he mentions statistics and anecdotes but never references the Koran nor statements made by influential Muslim clerics. I would hope a truly thinking Christian would want to consult the Koran and the writings of those who comment on it to form discerning conclusions about that faith.Daniel does not look to the Bible as a “final” authority on faith and theology. He suggests the possibility that the Bible was “written to convey spiritual wisdom rather than historical or scientific fact.” He advocates reading the Bible in such a way that it gives space for data from science. He explores what “biblical inerrancy” means and what it says to evolutionary biology and the study of evolving viruses, bacteria, etc. He suggests our understanding of the Bible should necessarily change as new scientific and sociological light is shined on issues. He rejects a narrow reading of the Old Testament and advocates a faith formed by empirical data.There are times when he selectively mentions Scripture. For example, when discussing whether Jesus was sinless or not, he writes, “It is true that a few passages in the New Testament seem to suggest Jesus was without sin (1 Pet. 2:21-23 and 2 Cor. 5:21, for example), but...”. He fails to mention Hebrews 4:15, a passage that is quite adamant that Jesus did not sin. Using the story of the Canaanite woman with the daughter tortured by a demon, Daniel thinks the best way to read the story is that “Jesus changed his mind and his heart.” Jesus' perfection “must be manifested in his ability to learn and to change.” We Christians should emulate his example of changing when confronted with new information. A case in point, he says, is that Christians should be using their voice for human rights, such as for the LGBT community. I wish he would have helped us work through biblical passages that seem to call for an opposite prophetic voice.Daniel says he is well aware that there can be criticism on both the progressive and conservative sides of Christianity. He claims this book is not a simple endorsement of liberalism nor a blanket condemnation of conservative Christianity. He says he is calling for a faith rooted in biblical knowledge and formed by intelligence, curiosity, and secular learning. I appreciate Daniel's suggestions that Christians should be informed by the past, science and by a knowledge of world events. But I am disappointed that the examples he used all seemed to be aimed at pointing out the errors of the conservative side of Christianity.Much of what Daniel says is a wake-up call to all Christians, both liberal and conservative. He makes many valuable points, giving evidence where unthinking Christians have made terrible assumptions resulting in terrible mistakes.Liberal Christians will love this book while conservatives will want to throw it across the room. I think its best use would be to initiate dialog. There is much conservative Christians could learn from this book, namely, how they are seen by liberals and non-Christians. And there is much liberal Christians could be asked to consider from their more conservative fellow Christians, such as the authority of Scripture. This book would be a good one over which to initiate the dialog. This would also be a good book for conservative Christians to read to understand how liberal Christians think.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for an independent and honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZXA9FQS6OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OYMW7E#wasThisHelpful","R2EZXA9FQS6OI","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Riggs wants us to see the sacred role we have in changing our corner of the world. She invites us to see the significance of an ordinary, average life. God chooses to invite us to join Him.She explores the issues that might keep us from entering into God's plan. She helps us understand we are free from condemnation (which is not the same as conviction). She shows that fear does not disqualify us from God's calling. God invites us to trust Him. But it is not a spectator sport.Riggs shares many of her own experiences. One is to help us understand that, even though God may ask us to relocate, He is always with us, preparing the way. Her life is a testimony that God will bring us through. She includes the examples of many biblical characters too.This book is a great encouragement to those who will never be on the cover of a magazine or be a mega-pastor. It is a book for those who desire to make a difference in their communities, their churches, and their families. “We can take solace and find comfort in the biblical accounts of people doing seemingly insignificant things that mattered for eternity.” (158)This is a great book for the average and ordinary Christian. We are encouraged to know that God has an adventure for us. There is no thinking that we are not smart enough or that we are too old. Riggs shows us that where ever we are, God is ready to use us.I recommend this book to those who have been discouraged by books mandating that we have to give up all to be used by God. He has a plan for us right now, Riggs writes. He delights in us and wants to use us right now.

"Dawkins is concerned that Christians are being duped by the identity thief. I think this book was misnamed. Something like Power Thief would have better described its content. In the end, he writes about the authority we have because we know Jesus, not about our righteousness nor the fruit of the Spirit. This book is not a study of our identity in Christ. It is about how the Thief has stolen our understanding of the power and authority we have in Christ. “I believe that as children of God, we can expect to walk in power and experience miracles on a constant basis.” The Thief has stolen that knowledge.Dawkins tells lots of stories to illustrate his concern. Many of the stories are about those who have forgotten who they are in Christ. Many of these stories are about pastors who have gone astray. The other stories are about the author, his children, and others who have evidenced their faith in the authority and power they have in Christ. The book is a collection of stories illustrating his concern, not a Scriptural investigation into our identity in Christ.If you want to read encouraging stories of people who exercised their spiritual authority, and heartbreaking stories of those who didn't, you will like this book.  If you want to obtain a biblical strategy for battling the mind schemes the Thief employs, you will have to look elsewhere.Dawkins encourages us to know the identity and birthright we have in Christ. He emphasizes the aspect of our being told to heal the sick and raise the dead. He encourages us to protect ourselves from the deceit and trickery of the Thief. We must do that by exercising our faith in what God says is true of us. The actual strategy is left up to us.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBH1ZR5RQMKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800797787#wasThisHelpful","R1KBH1ZR5RQMKN","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wellness is a broad term and this book contains a wealth of information about creating a wellness plan. When the information in this book is applied, Sherwood writes, we will experience more energy and strength.This book is much more than just about what we eat. He reminds us that wellness has four components: being spiritually connected, intellectually stimulated, emotionally balanced, and physically strong and energized. He reminds us that wellness is learned and must be practiced. He gives a plan that helps us progress in each of those areas.Some of what Sherwood prescribes is familiar. There is an emphasis on increased physical activity and making better nutritional choices. But there are suggestions that may be surprising. He writes about managing stress, about limiting social media and news broadcasts, about character traits like integrity, saying “no” to manipulative people, and even some communication skills. So this book is much more than an eating or exercise plan. It is really a road map to complete wellness, including the mind and spirit as well as the body. He presents the plan is phases to ease us into the healthy habits.There are plenty of practical tips included to start us on our way to wellness. He helps us set appropriate goals. He advises that we keep a journal and suggests the content. He asks us to change our perspective and begin thinking of ourselves as people in hot pursuit of health and wellness.Sherwood reminds us that developing a wellness plan is planning for a way to live the most fulfilling life possible.

"We text, email, and update our status on social sites to communicate with others. “There's a definite place for social media,” Bechtle writes, “but it's not for making deep connections with people and growing relationships. It's for keeping track of others in a casual way...” This book is a good reminder that a key to healthy relationships is effective communication. Often, the text or email is just not enough. We need face to face conversation.We are reminded how much of communication is beyond the mere words being said. There is body language and tone of voice that we miss by communicating technologically. That can be up to 90% of the tools essential for effective communication.Bechtle wants us to communicate well so he gives us a strategy to use with various tools and techniques. This book is a good exploration of communication, looking at the needs of people, the tools we can use for conversation and the techniques for using those tools. He includes other aspects of relationships too, like how they mature and how communication problems develop.I liked his thoughts on listening and how important it is to establishing authentic communication. He encourages us to be present, really listening, not thinking of our next response. His teachings on humility and pride are excellent.Bechtle says we can always refresh our communication toolbox. We can learn new skills to be more effective communicators. He give practical steps to do just that. He has some good ideas to keep technology from taking over relationship times, like turning off cell phones during family meals.The bottom line is that we must be intentional to communicate well and build good relationships. “Technology should be a way of enhancing our communication, not replacing it.”I highly recommend this book to those who desire to communicate well.

"This novel is the fourth in The Hawk and the Dove series. It is a little different than the others in that it goes day by day through the season of Lent.Lent is the time of taking away comforts. Yet, for Brother Conradus, the hardest thing was remembering to do all he had been told and asked to do. For Brother Cormac, the hardest thing to do was break the fast after Holy Week.For Brother Tom, the hardest thing to do was forget past injustices and be willing to show grace to an enemy. This difficult task comes to the forefront when John returns to the abbey. He'd been away to Cambridge for a year of training to be the abbot. Upon his return, prior William arrives, destitute and in need of a place to stay. While John wants to show grace, Tom cannot forget the injustice William showed to Father Peregrine.This novel is a good study in character. I loved how John, on his journey back to the abbey, gave away all his food and money. He is a giving and humble man. He is uncomfortable when he is shown deference because he is the abbot elect. He learns that nearby St. Dunstan's had burned and most of the monks, detested by the community, had died in the fire. Not prior William, however.The good character traits of the monks at St. Alcuin's Abbey are tested when prior William asks for residence. Many know this William and do not like him at all. While John wants to show grace, the monks are adverse to having such a horrible man in their abbey. Is William a man who should be shown mercy or is he really a wolf in sheep's clothing?I enjoyed this novel. I continued to learn about abbey life, this time specifically about Lent and what meager food they ate. I was also faced with some good spiritual lessons. One was illustrated by Brother Tom. He has a quick temper and must frequently ask for forgiveness. “...Brother Tom wondered how other people managed – ordinary people outside the monastery walls who tried to muddle along without this discipline of humble contrition to heal the wounds made by human carelessness.” (118) That reminded me of how infrequently at church we are reminded of our sins and are given opportunity to repent, even silently.There are other lessons too, such as trying to see a situation from another's viewpoint before being so quick to pass judgment. And then there is forgiveness. Do we forgive past hurts, unconditionally, even when the mean person has not repented or asked for forgiveness?I recommend this novel to those who enjoy historical fiction. You'll learn a great deal about how an abbey functioned during the fourteenth century.  You'll also meet godly men who struggle to follow the rule of St. Benedict as they follow Christ.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQUKW9BWESRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782641483#wasThisHelpful","RLQUKW9BWESRR","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But we are also given a few more mysteries to be solved in the next episode.People who like 1940s style mystery and intrigue will enjoy this series. The dialog is fun. When was the last time you heard “peepers” for eyes? How about having a “gas” for having fun? The characters are well crafted too. The style of writing reminds me of the serialized stories of decades ago.I received a complimentary digital copy of this episode through The Book Club Network for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3C6GZDUJIR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I46IZO#wasThisHelpful","R1V3C6GZDUJIR3","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is not for the stars of the Christian world. Rather, it is for everyday Christians who are living seemingly normal, mundane lives yet want to make a difference. Crowe provides encouragement in figuring out how that influence can be generated.Don't expect this to be a productivity book. It is devotional in nature and is a good source for us to look at our lives and how we live them out with sacred intent.Crowe likens all of life to seven days. Each day relates to a theme he covers. Monday is the start of a new work week and the theme is influence. He reminds us that God designed us for influence and leadership. We learn lessons from Moses/Joshua and Paul/Timothy. Tuesday is a good day to realize time is limited and we are reminded what happens to our time when we are not intentional with it. Crowe wants us to live each day on purpose with purpose.Wednesday is about our calling – what gives us purpose. He looks at four aspects: church, family, citizen, and contributor. He emphasizes living in connection with Jesus and having our identity in Him. Thursday is about engaging the world and how God wants our life to be saturated with salt and light. Friday covers relationships, both friendships and collaborative efforts. Saturday is a good day for thinking about motivation. Motivation produces focus resulting in obedience to God's call on our lives. “Sunday is the perfect day for believing the impossible.” (205) It's the day to dream of ideas that would turn the world upside down.This would be a great book to read on a week vacation or retreat. Crowe helps us think through many issues in our life and encourages us to live each moment with sacred purpose. He gives great examples from his own life and the lives of others. He offers insight from Scripture too. He includes practical advice, like how to choose a mentor. He has included an Appendix with positive statements about each day's topics and a prayer as a review and aid for transforming our lives.My favorite section was the one on time. “How we use our time is a reflection of our understanding, or misunderstanding, of God's purpose for our lives.” (62) Ouch.I recommend this book to those who have the desire to see their lives make a difference but just don't know how to go about it. You'll get some great encouragement as you think through your life and decide to live with sacred intention.I received a complimentary digital copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EVXO5BWC6JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106V05UM#wasThisHelpful","R23EVXO5BWC6JJ","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The small sleepy town of Hidden Springs comes wide awake when a body is found near the entrance to the courthouse. The man had been shot, and recently. Deputy Sheriff Michael Keane is on the case.  Before he can make much headway, there is another murder. As the deputy pursues slim leads, it looks like these murders may have their origin in a missing person case a decade old.This is a pretty good cozy mystery. I like the characters Gabhart has crafted. Hidden Springs is a small town with quirky characters – some lovable and some not so lovable. I liked the secondary characters, Michael's wise aunt and Anthony, the troubled teen. Reading the novel made me feel like I was in a close knit small southern community.The mystery aspect of the novel is good. There certainly are enough hints that a reader could figure out the murderer. It was so plain early on that I thought maybe it was a red herring. In addition to the mystery is just a hint of romance. The aspect of the novel I liked the best was Michael helping Anthony. Both had been orphaned while young and Michael really has a heart for the troubled teen.This is not a very complex mystery. It is an enjoyable one and I recommend it to authors who like a murder mystery without the gore and offensive language. This looks like the first novel in a new series and I'll be watching for the next one.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AS4DV6G73SXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGRPM#wasThisHelpful","R1AS4DV6G73SXV","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are made up of our MADFATs, Motives, Affections, Desires, Feelings, Actions, and Thoughts. The authors want us to find freedom from negative MADFATs, and have written this book to help us position ourselves so God can do that. “This book has been designed to help facilitate the healthy, fruitful gardening of your heart, mind and soul by exposing you to relevant concepts of science, as well as the inspiring light found in the Word of God.” (101)This book is a combination of scientific knowledge and spiritual insights. We are given information as to how the brain works, how patterns are formed and dissolved, how our view of God shapes our brain, and how negative and positive thoughts affect our brain. They explain how change happens, including neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. They write about the role of visualizing, meditating, writing, and practice. To be transformed, we must continually access and receive the indwelling gift of the Holy Spirit and His life changing power.This takes practice and effort. The rewiring guides have the purpose of exposing our soul to God's transforming work. “Regeneration of the soul is God's department. You can, nonetheless, enable Him to do His work by creating an environment within you where His healing, restoring powers will be effective.” (65)The last half of the book consists of Practice Sheets. The idea is to repeatedly rewrite the affirmations, helping the new neural pathways to be solidified. Each day of the week focuses on one topic and they are repeated weekly. The authors remind us that this is a process and documenting the journey allows us to record what works and what doesn't, the Scriptures that influence us, etc.There is a great amount of material in this book. Much of it should be read over and over to help the truth get into the inside of us. There are over fifty weeks of Practice Sheets so we know this book is not a quick fix – it is a process of change in thinking, believing, and practice. Reading this book is a commitment and I recommend it to those who are serious in their desire for transformation.I received a complimentary copy of this book through The Book Club Network for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJP6FHREL1R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981753434#wasThisHelpful","RYJP6FHREL1R9","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is the best episode yet in this series. It is jam packed with action and moves the story along well.At the outset a American spy is killed without delivering the microfilm that cost him his life. We wonder if this means the Nazis will have a stable supply of power from a hydrogen based fuel.Bauer knows that Meeker survived the plane crash but is hesitant to kill her. He desperately needs to know what her assignment is.Meanwhile, Meeker convinces her superiors that she needs to go behind enemy lines. She actually ends up in the same room with Hitler and Himmler. But her plans go wrong and disaster strikes, leaving a death in its wake.Bauer is intent on finding the Fountain of Youth and thinks he has a lead. His desire for the promised rejuvenation takes him to New Orleans. Meeker ends up there too and when disaster strikes again, we are left waiting for the next episode.I love this series. The dialog is snappy and full of wit. The characters are well crafted and, in this episode, the action is intense and continuous. This episode clearly reflects the price special agents have to pay to keep our country safe.

"Sometimes Christians are burdened down, living under the lies of the enemy. Tomlinson has the good news that we can break away from those lies. She ought to know because she did it herself.She shares her story of being molested as a preschooler. Even though she accepted Jesus as Savior as a young person, she continued to believe Satan's lie, that she was dirty and unworthy. She went through dark days of an unwed pregnancy, marriage and divorce, and alcohol abuse. She became convinced God could never love her again. Her feelings of regret and condemnation were overwhelming.Her turning point came when she had a severe allergic reaction and faced death. She finally and fully placed herself in the hands of God. He later revealed to her the lies she had been believing. She shares the powerful truth God used in her life as He guided her to deliverance and freedom.This book is a great encouragement to Christians who feel far from God, for women who feel they are somehow second class in God's eyes because of their gender, and for men and the lies they face. She writes about freedom from fear, about overcoming a victim mentality, about living out the finished work of Calvary, and much more. She reminds us that we are significant and worthy (because of Jesus) in God's eyes. She encourages us to live in the truth of God's forgiveness and amazing love.In the end, Tomlinson reminds us that we have work to do. We are not to passively accept the lies of the enemy. We are to say “no” by agreeing with the Word of God. “By doing so, you are taking charge of your life with the power of the truth of God.” (162) And in case we don't know how to use the Scriptures, she has listed several at the end of the book for specific meditation.This is an excellent book, full of encouragement and identity building Scripture verses. I highly recommend it to anyone who desires to truly live out who they are in Christ.

"Living out the Christian life, the spirituality, is often messy. We may look together on the outside but it may be a facade covering the turmoil within. This spiritual memoir shares one woman's journey.After twenty years of what Gotthardt calls a squeaky clean life, she decided to break the rules. She didn't set out to be a rebel. She just wanted to follow Jesus more faithfully. It started when she said no to the ministry responsibilities she accumulated as a pastor's wife. She realized she was missing out on the enjoyment of God. Something had to change.She shares what brought her to that point and how the change allowed her to fall in love with Jesus is ways she had never imagined. But it was not all smooth sailing. She battled depression early on in her marriage. Medication helped but then she felt shame over not be able to spiritually conquer her feelings. She was in a Christian yoga group and eventually taught it. She took a beating from a few Christians and some left their church. She and her pastor husband struggled with her finding new ministry opportunities outside of their church.I really appreciated one struggle she describes. “Nice is not a fruit of the Spirit,” Gotthardt writes. She tried being nice, hiding her hurt and anger. “Letting go of nice has been the foundational task in my movement toward greater intimacy with God.” (65) God gently coaxed her forward through the discomfort of new emotions and untested responses.I respect Gotthardt's journey. She struggled with finding the right path for her spirituality. She admits that is was difficult but it changed her. She has entered into an open expanse of God's love.Gotthardt points out that she has had support in her journey. She made us of professional counseling, has a spiritual director, and has, at times, hired a personal coach. This may be somewhat beyond the experience or financial ability of some. Nonetheless, it is a story that those burdened with shame and guilt would benefit from reading.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNTFL7SFRPUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825442281#wasThisHelpful","R3GNTFL7SFRPUG","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This touching novella takes us through one loving family's Christmas celebration. We experience most of the activity through the eyes of Katie, a newcomer this year. She is the girlfriend of Micah, a grandson in the Binder family.The novella begins with the embarrassing scene of Katie saying “No” to Micah's marriage proposal – in front of all the Binder family. Then we readers jump back to earlier, while Micah and Katie were on their way to the grandparents cottage in Wisconsin. Katie receives a devastating text that convinces here she could never be the wife Micah deserves.Ruchti then takes us through the Binder family celebration. And what a family it is. They are the sweetest grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren. I loved the interaction of the family. One son is a card and always has a quick and funny retort. One grand daughter is a health nut. To Katie's amazement, they all get along. The days in the crowded Binder cottage are the kind we wish we'd had with our own family.There is lots of action that goes on in the few days this novel covers. There is death and new life. There is love and the letting go of regrets. There is honesty and acceptance. There is laughter and celebration. There are prayers and tears. Coming from a dysfunctional background, Katie is awed by the well adjusted nature of the Binders. “So this is what courageous, extravagant love looks like,” she thinks. The experience is life changing for her.Ruchti has a way with words. Diapers become “infant waste management aids.” Much of the dialog is snappy and fun. But on occasion it becomes a bit much. Some of Katie's thinking is choppy and hard to follow. I found myself reading some sentences over and over, trying to clear the confusion over the word usage. I didn't like the short and out of time sequence prologue with the aborted proposal. I think it would have better been put in its appropriate time context. Yet, for me, these were minor issues in an otherwise moving novella.I recommend this novella to those looking for a heart warming and very rewarding Christmas story.I received a complimentary digital copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U2DC85DDMQXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617955876#wasThisHelpful","R2U2DC85DDMQXY","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the Watervalley series and I enjoyed it every bit as much as I did the first two. I am delighted at the ability of the author to craft such a compelling story of life in a small Tennessee town.Luke Bradford is the medical doctor but he heals much more than physical bodies. He has a genuine concern for his patients and others he has come to know in the short time he has been in Watervalley. This novel deals with a few veterans and the after effects of war. Luke is so good at helping these men heal the hurt that has settled deep inside. The Doc is a great character, one I admire more with each of these novels. His relationship with Christine is maturing and it looks like he might spring the marriage question.Watervalley is a small town where everybody knows what everybody else is doing. It is one of those towns where there are summer outdoor movies with families spread out on blankets. But it is also a town that has a hard time accepting new comers. There is a new veterinarian in town, a slight woman. She has a special rapport with animals but has difficulty convincing the rough and tumble farmers she can handle their livestock.We also get a little insight into the Amish community that lies to the north of the town. Luke is instrumental in uncovering a decades old mystery and mending a few fences between people separated not so much by miles but by belief and practice.I love the dialog. Luke is a witty man and the dialog between him and Christine is great. Here is an example of the dialog between Connie, Luke's sort of cook and house keeper, and her recently arrived younger sister, Estelle. Estelle says she has an hour glass figure and Connie responds, “Don't look now, but I think the sands of time have shifted on you.” (238) There's other humor too, like the elderly woman who has her driving license revoked because of her eyesight. The next time Luke sees her she is tooling down main street perched on her riding lawnmower.Yes, there is some cussin' and some drinkin', just like in any small town. Yes, there are some angry people and some compassionate ones, just like in any small town. In the center of it all is Luke, trying to be the best man he can be to his new found friends. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy novels about small town life in America and are not put off by a little reality.I received a complimentary copy of this book through Litfuse for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMBV4RJUEZR6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474104#wasThisHelpful","RMBV4RJUEZR6P","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this second novel in the Watervalley series. Dr. Luke Bradford has settled in and decided to stay and fulfill the three year contract with the Tennessee community. In this novel he has a mystery to solve and a beautiful woman to date.The mystery is from decades ago. Oscar Fox had come to Watervalley and opened a bakery. He was involved in the murder of a German and was himself killed. The town people thought Oscar an infamous man. Luke found Fox's medical file in the old records of the clinic. He pursues the mystery. We readers discover, along with Luke, the truth behind who Oscar was and the real man he had been.It's the characters that make the story. Connie's sister, Estelle, has come to Watervalley. What a set of sisters those two are. Their relationship is a kick. And can they dance! Then there is John. He's finally reconciled with the people of Watervalley. It was fun to watch him change, to see the hurts heal and his heart open up again. And how about that Sunshine with her colon cleanse!Then again, maybe it's the dialog. High has a way with words. He is able to reveal the personalities of characters in his book through snappy dialog. I love it.Life goes on in Watervalley. There are some slimy characters and some good ones. There is some cussin' and drinkin' and some going to church and some forgiving. Just like a small Tennessee town.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2C40FISL096/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419278#wasThisHelpful","RV2C40FISL096","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We Boomers are getting older. Otis wants us to do so truly living life. With right planning and a good attitude, he writes, we can make our latter years some of our best. His book is written with a sense of humor yet contains valuable and practical information. It is truly an encouragement to not give up but live life to its very end.This book is a joy to read. Otis has a quirky sense of humor. Just when the subject matter is getting serious, he inserts a few groaners to help make the material more enjoyable.But the meat of the book is the great advice Otis has for us. Some of that advice is practical. He writes about the dangers of falling and includes good tips to prevent it. He writes about the necessity of a Legal Advanced Health Care Directive, how to evaluate care facilities and potential care givers, the importance of understanding the meaning of your life, the essential nature of belief in God, and much more.Woven through the humor and the practical advice is evidence of Otis' heart. He wants us to have the right attitude for truly living life. He emphasizes choice. We can choose to really live. He suggests helping others and allowing others to help us. He advises going barefoot more often, watching more sunsets, trying new things, staying curious and learning something new, and much more. He reminds us that people who convince themselves they can't – won't.He tells loads of stories. One that struck me was his going to a friend's 101 year birthday party. His friend had to use a walker, had trouble hearing and seeing, yet was the life of the party. He was the life of every party he'd been to, Otis writes. What an example of not letting physical disabilities get in the way of living life to its fullest.This is not just a book for the elderly. Otis has included great tips for care givers and those visiting the sick, such as what to say and not say. He also has great information for younger readers, especially those anticipating caring for elderly loved ones.Otis is somewhat of an authority on the subject of aging. He's eighty five, in pain from a previous surgery gone wrong, and thoroughly living life. He lost his loving wife a couple of years ago yet has a positive attitude. He's in an assisted care facility yet uses the experience to interact with people and learn. He is a good example of really living life no matter one's age or physical condition. As Otis notes near the end of his book, “It is never too early to plan your life's journey. It is never too late to live it.” (188)I received a complimentary digital copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBRDNV0CXMLTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y75QO0Y#wasThisHelpful","RBRDNV0CXMLTL","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wild at Heart series comes to an end with this fun western romance.This novel centers on Bailey, the only one of the Wilde sisters not yet married. Bailey is doing just fine on her ranch until Gage decides he wants to run his cattle in the canyon he owns but her ranch blocks access to. When she forbids him to cross her property, he literally blasts another path into the canyon.The adversarial relation ship between Bailey and Gage takes a sharp turn when he comes to her in the spring – needing a wife. His ma is coming and he had written her last fall that he was married and doing just fine. He never thought his mother would actually come to visit. Gage desperately assures her the marriage would be in name only. Bailey strikes a hard bargain but, tired and lonely after a hard winter, agrees.The situation becomes potentially deadly when it is clear someone is trying to kill Gage. And Bailey is fit to be tied with Gage's ma being very jealous of the attention he shows his wife. Perhaps this “marriage” is over before it really got started.Talk about an overbearing mother, Gage's ma takes the prize. And Gage, being a man, just does not see what it is doing to Bailey. And Bailey, being the independent woman she's been for years, has a hard time being controlled by someone else. It's a recipe for relationship disaster which can only be surmounted if love breaks through.Bailey fought in the Civil War (you have to read the previous novels in this series). She saw some pretty horrible things and took part in an act that haunts her even now. That results in a good lesson about God's forgiveness. Bailey is a strong female heroine I enjoyed.This series has also contained a good lesson in parenting. The Wilde sisters' father is not a man whose example any should follow. It is amazing the women turned out as they did with such a terrible father.This novel contains well drawn characters, frontier intrigue, a little romance, and a little humor.

"Vanderstelt has a vision. “...Jesus saturation – every man, woman and child in every place having an encounter with Jesus through words spoken and deeds done through his people.” (13)At one of their community dinners, the seed was planted. What if people feasted and celebrated around Jesus together? What if people's homes were some of the primary places where ministry took place?The concept was to see the church no longer disconnected from everyday life. God is seen working through people in their daily acts of life. We learn “to see all of life as sacred and every action as part of God's missionary work in the world.” (42) Life is lived so people are visible and accessible. Discipleship becomes life-on-life, happening all the time in work and play.“We need to train people how to live everyday life with gospel intentionality, showing what it looks like to follow Jesus in the normal stuff.” (170) Everyday events were identified to engage people in the light of the gospel. Eating is one of those daily rhythms where people can meet others in their neighborhood. Several others were identified as well.I really like this concept of being in the community, sharing life lived in the light of the gospel. The ideas of how to do that are many. One unique way of serving the community was offering to drive people home after a city pub crawl. Bartenders were given phone numbers of volunteers willing to take home those who should not be driving.Vanderstelt tells many stories of how people impacted their communities. What an encouragement to read of a church really making a difference to those around them. They were asked, “Why are you doing this?” They could offer a gentle answer about sharing the grace and love they have received through Jesus.This is a very encouraging book. I would recommend it to pastors, church boards, and Christians in general. This book will get you excited about ministering to the needs right in your very own neighborhood. Appendixes have been added that have valuable resources for setting up missional communities including samples of covenant materials.Vanderstelt suggests that each of us, “Live in such a way that it would demand a 'Jesus explanation.' In other words, you wouldn't be able to explain what you do or why without needing to talk about Jesus.” (182)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GPJXXPXBPCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433545993#wasThisHelpful","R4GPJXXPXBPCB","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Christmas novella takes place at the Tidewater Inn, a key setting in The Hope Beach series. There are three novels in the series and it would be best to have read them before reading this novella. Coble mentions several characters and events in this novella from those previous books. While one could enjoy reading this work alone, there would be much that would be missed.This story centers on Delilah, manager of the Tidewater Inn. She's preparing for a wedding at the inn when there is an attempt on her life. Enter Tom, the local sheriff. He's been noticing Delilah for a long time but just has not had the nerve to tell her so.So there is suspense, a mystery and the potential of a romance. The action in this novella goes fast. There is not a whole lot of character development nor description of the surrounding area, typical of such a short narrative. The plot was a decent one. Perhaps for brevity, there is some resolution of suspense that seemed a little too convenient.I liked the story. For it's length, I think it is good.

She relates many stories and gives suggestions. Saying something, she writes, is better than saying nothing. But she also reminds us what kinds of things not to say. For example, be specific in your help. “I'll pick up the kids for a play date on Tuesday,” rather than, “If you need anything, let me know.”There are good suggestions for the ill person too. Keep your friends informed. (Kara blogged regularly.) The Tippets had a cooler on their step where meals in disposable dishes could be left without barging into the house. There was also a chalk board near the door indicating whether Kara was up for visitors or not.Kara wrote a section on what the care professionals call “the ministry of presence.” We can perform ministry by simply showing up and being there for someone. No clever dialog is required. No deep prayer session. Kara noted that she was blessed when Scripture was read to her...without commentary.This is an excellent book for those who want to help a suffering friend but do not know how to begin. Kara added some thought provoking questions at the end of her entries. Readers are encouraged to engage with others. It need be nothing elaborate. Perhaps just a cup of coffee. I remember a rewarding time when a friend and I sat with a stroke victim from church, giving her husband time away to do some errands. She talked and we listened and all of us were blessed.This is an excellent book on a difficult subject. I highly recommend it to those who would live well and die well, and to those who would support others in that journey.Food for thought: “We need each other.

"I grew up reading the 1940s style detective mysteries so reading this book was an experience in nostalgia. Collins has done a good job of recreating postwar Chicago with its gangsters, a crack newspaper reporter, a romantic private investigator and a police detective struggling with his war memories.The plot is a little complex, involving a murder committed twenty years ago. We know from the outset that the wrong man was arrested for that murder. Now, years later, three men are killed and the murder weapons are fruitcakes in cans heavy enough to crack a skull with a deadly blow. The mystery that needs to be unraveled is how the old fruitcakes, made by the company owned by the wrongfully accused killer of twenty years ago, tie the three men together and sealed their fate.The strength of this novel is the historical setting. Collins is a master at witty dialog and exact descriptions of historical places and events. The feel of the novel is really that of authors of the 1940s. I thoroughly enjoyed that. I felt like I was reading a classic detective novel from years ago.I loved the characters. Tiffany is a crack newspaper reporter. She has a nose for getting the facts. Her relationship with Lane, the police detective is a riot. Their dialog is classic. Collins brings in a private detective, an old war buddy of Lane's, who has eyes for Tiffany, challenging Lane's unspoken but deeply felt affection for her. That little bit of a relationship triangle brought added interest to the plot.I did feel the plot was a little too complex. It takes a lengthy explanation to tie all the murder victims together. I would have liked to see something a little more straight forward without so many hidden elements. Granted, they are all revealed in the end but many of the necessary facts are hidden from readers so we don't have the challenge and joy of trying to uncover the mystery ourselves.One of the issues of the novel is a person wrongly convicted of a crime and ultimately executed for it. The discussion guide at the end helps readers think through that event.I enjoyed the novel and recommend it to those who like the 1940s style detective mystery.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGPHDNF8GBP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXJK94O#wasThisHelpful","R2CGPHDNF8GBP7","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We Christians are to be thinking people and sometimes we need resources to help us. The authors have written this book to help fill in those areas where we need clarity in our thinking.They start with basic questions about trusting the Bible. They cover loads of topics, such as believing God is good, the supernatural, the destiny of man, the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, Jesus' return, and many more.The authors have limited their answers to a few pages, even though books have been written about some of these issues. The idea is that these answers are not exhaustive but are more springboards for further investigation. There are books listed in For Further Reading so the topics can be explored more deeply. There are also Discussion Questions listed at the end of each chapter.Potential readers should be aware that this is a very general and introductory collection of questions and answers. For example, when investigating the claim of possible errors in the Bible, they address the issue in general, not looking at any specific issues.Salvation is clearly explained so the book is suitable for someone investigating Christianity. There are places where the authors expect readers to accept the Bible as truth so those answers are suitable for readers already Christians. There were a few of discussions I especially appreciated. One was a very good teaching on the Trinity. Another was the explanation for the formation of the canon. Another was a balanced and well presented look at the return of Christ, not giving a particular view of the timing of the rapture, but covering the various possibilities.Some of the questions surprised me, such as the role of emotions in our Christian life. The authors talk about the “dark night of the soul,” something usually discussed in more advanced books. But the authors have selected the questions because they themselves have been asked these questions over the years. So the book does not deal with just theology but questions of life, like happiness and purpose. They have an excellent discussion of what it means to be “in” the world but not “of” the world. And they tackle hard questions, like unanswered prayer.I recommend this book to new Christians or those investigating Christianity. You'll get some good answers, some questions to stimulate your thinking, and some suggestions to investigate further.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YWW43RWLFMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801016665#wasThisHelpful","R38YWW43RWLFMM","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a WW II novel with a captivating twist. I really liked it.Roger Greene was shot down over Nazi Germany in 1943. He was taken prisoner and became part of a bazaar experiment. Called the Methuselah Project, an eccentric scientist injected Roger and six others with chemicals and submitted them to treatments.Roger was the only one who survived. He's lived for decades in a basement cell. And he has never aged. He's been lied to by his caretakers and believes the war is still going on, although at somewhat of a stalemate. The only thing that has kept him from going crazy is the Bible he reads.After some 70 years of captivity, one of his caretakers turns sympathetic and there is a chance for an escape. But could he ever be free or would the organization holding him captive hunt him until they could take him out? And when he meets a woman who offers to help him, how does he know he can even trust her?This is great fiction. We have bazaar experiments going on in the last months of the Nazi regime. We have a secret organization of Nazi war survivors who hid their experiments, and Roger, from the Allies. That organization continues today with nefarious intentions and operatives in several countries. And Roger, even if he could escape and get free, how could he ever convince anyone he was nearly a hundred years old, looking like a young man?The characters are well done. Roger is a well crafted guy out of the forties. He talks like one and acts like one. The gal he meets is a well crafted character too. She is a little naive about the secret organization her uncle has convinced her to join, but she has a good heart.There is lots of action in the novel. I liked the way the plot developed, as the narrative goes back and forth from WW II to today. Barry has made a conspiracy organization and a bazaar experiment into a believable and very readable story.

"I like a well written police procedure novel and this is a good one.This is the first novel about Nikki Boyd. She's with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation on the Missing Persons Task Force. She signed on for the investigative work nearly a decade ago, after her younger sister was abducted and never found. She is called in to head the task force when a teen goes missing.Harris has given us a good mixture of police work, psychological insight, and just a hint of romance. Nikki is driven to find the missing teen as she battles with her memories of her sister's abduction. But then the current case takes on a twist when a photo of the terrified teen is uncovered – just like a photo of her sister was left. Could it be the same person, silent for ten years? Is her own life in danger?Harris has given us a good female protagonist. I like the way Nikki's character is developed. We are privy to her troubled thoughts but not enough to detract from the action. The secondary character in the book Tyler. He had been married to Nikki's best friend who died a year ago. Nikki and Tyler talk quite a bit about guilt as both feel somewhat responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. I trust that is just setting the stage and both of them will move forward in the next novel. There is a hint of romance between the two, something I look forward to seeing develop.I always like to learn something new when I read a novel. This time it was about hiking in the Smoky Mountains. I also learned about how easy it is to fake an identity on social media sites for the purpose of attracting teen girls. That aspect of the novel is a wake up call to parents of teens.The only aspect of the novel that makes it less than perfect was the suspense near the end. I loved the build up. I was surprised at the identity of the bad guy. The resolution of the suspense I thought was just a little unrealistic, too convenient. But that was a minor flaw in an otherwise great book. I recommend it to those who like suspense with a strong female protagonist.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KVVPEWD1JR38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGQ0S#wasThisHelpful","R3KVVPEWD1JR38","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You've heard the cry that the church is dying. Shaw says the future can be bright but we need to increase our understanding of what's going on – increase our generational intelligence.In the first half of the book, Shaw gives us information on the generations. He identifies them, gives us the basics of what they believe, shows how the time in which they were born shapes them, and reveals their strengths and temptations.I am impressed with this information. I now have a much better understanding of why those of younger generations behave as they do. As an older Baby Boomer, I've got some insight as to why Generation Xers are cynical and skeptical. I have a much better understanding why Millennials are so confident and see morality so differently than I do. I understand the “emerging adulthood” phenomenon and why twenty-something young people are still living at home.The second half of the book builds on the information Shaw gave in the first half. He helps parents know how to engage their prodigal children. He has very good insights and suggestions about those leaving the church and cohabiting, for example. Then he explores what the generational information means for the church. He assures us Christianity will not disappear but he also identifies the challenges the church is facing, such as the way outreach is done. He has good suggestions for reaching young people and helping them think through intellectual challenges. He also includes ideas for older people, such as when their church becomes something they no longer like.I am impressed with the understanding and insight Shaw has concerning generational differences. I know from my own family experience that he is right on. I knew the younger generation was different and now I know how and why. I also have some good ideas about initiating conversation with them, that is, listening first.Shaw has presented lots of great information in this book to help us understand the generational differences. He admits he does not have all the answers. But he does have some good ideas to start the dialog. I highly recommend this book to parents, pastors and church leaders who want to understand generational differences. It would be great for young people too, as it will help them understand the older generations.We all need to increase our generational intelligence and this book is a good place to start.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EPEPQDSGB4HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCJXWYA#wasThisHelpful","R3EPEPQDSGB4HO","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you feel you are at the end of yourself, Idleman says that's a good place to be. That is when Jesus becomes real in your life.His book is divided into two parts. In the first part, he explores how we come to the end of ourselves. The rest of the book is about putting ourselves into the best position to be used by God.Idleman looks at four beatitudes that put us on the path to real life. He writes about brokenness – the way to wholeness, mourning – the way to happiness, humbleness – the way to being exalted, and authenticity – the way to being accepted.Then he shows how Jesus fills us when we are empty. He uses stories from the Bible to illustrate how Jesus is willing to do that. Idleman also looks at what prevents us from being filled, such as failing to ask, feeling unworthy, and thinking it is too late. He also writes about our attempts to fill our soul with things that do not fit.This is a pretty good book on getting to the point where we have nothing left. He has great stories (many about himself) and biblical illustrations as well as good exposition of Scripture. His chapter on humility is great and worth reading the book.The only thing that makes this book less than perfect is Idleman's quirky humor (you just have to read the footnotes). He's a funny man. But as I imagined a devastated person reading this book, hoping to find God's way out of the depths he or she is in, the humor seemed inappropriate and something that reduced the seriousness of the rest of his book.I recommend this book but if you are really at the end of yourself, skip the humorous footnotes and just read Idleman's serious and encouraging part of the text.Food for thought: “Dying to myself and reaching the end of me is meant to be a daily decision and a daily demonstration.”I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPPWUNJATDGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT2YEHY#wasThisHelpful","R1GPPWUNJATDGF","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kauflin encourages us to see worship “as our highest goal, our loftiest aim – the great purpose of our existence.” There is no higher goal than to revel in our great and awesome God. But what does that mean? Right now. Today. Sunday.He reminds us that true worshipers worship in spirit and truth (John 4:24). That is worship springing from a sincere heart and lining up with the truth of God's Word. We can only do that through the work of Christ. He emphasizes our inability to worship God unless He draws us by grace and reveals Himself through His Word.The essence of worship, Kauflin says, is exalting God in our hearts and actions. He suggests a good way to begin is to remember that God exists in every situation. Right now. He also writes about the importance of gathering in community to worship. He wrote quite a bit about music too, why we sing, why we must sing. He also covers what we are to expect when we worship, including edifying one another. He ends the book with worship in heaven.I like the way Kauflin has given us the essentials of worship. He could have written a longer book, he says, but wanted something that covered the questions he has been asked over the years and the areas where he has seen Christians struggle. I like how he clarifies when worship happens. It is not just something on Sunday morning. It is to be the totality of our lives.This is a good introduction to worship, what it is, how we do it, and why we do it.

"Christians sometimes concentrate on heaven but Johnson reminds us that we are instructed to pray that God's will be done here, now. He encourages us to be a transforming influence on our community.Some Christians think that influence has to be through politics or business. Johnson believes we should bring the Kingdom influence to every reach of society. Each of us has daily opportunities for transforming influence. That influence comes from intentional living.He shares how the church he pastors has been instrumental in transforming the attitude and value system of their city. “Success in God's eyes is seen in the impact the message of the Kingdom has on how people think and live in my city, region and nation.” They found that the more they served their city with no agenda other than that the Lord be glorified, the more the city opened up to the message they carried.This is an encouraging and convicting book. I realize that many Christians have not learned about God and His Kingdom well enough to influence themselves and the community in which they live. Johnson has very good suggestions about basic attitudes we are to have towards those in the community. One that struck me was valuing people before they are converted. Every individual has been made in the image of God and has been given gifts by Him. That attitude of honoring others is an important first step to influence.This book is a great challenge for us to impact our community. We can carry the blessing of God to others. We can share the gifts God has given us with others. We can reveal the nature of God to others. If that is what you would like to do, this book will encourage you.Food for thought: “My assignment is to bring heaven to earth through my prayers and acts of radical obedience.”I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31WFTOSTC7BJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NTP7F2#wasThisHelpful","R31WFTOSTC7BJ0","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is by no means a scholarly look at the subject. It is more Brueggemann's feelings on the situation with some Scripture investigation and then a study guide as a springboard for discussion.He notes that he championed the idea that Israel needed to be a nation but is now having second thoughts about their national behavior. There has been indifference toward the human rights of Palestinians. The way Israel is behaving, Brueggemann writes, they are not making a good impression as “God's chosen people.”An unconditional one-sided support of Israel is not the way to move forward in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One must realistically look at the political situation if there is ever to be a solution.He explores how one reads the Bible and the meaning of Israel as “chosen.” Sometimes it looks unconditional while other times conditional (as in Exod. 19:5). With respect to the land, “...we may conclude that the land is given to Israel unconditionally, but is held by Israel conditionally.” Looking at the various verses in Joshua, he concludes, “Thus, the land is given, the land is taken, and the land is losable.” This is evidenced in the exile, the return, then losing the land again.He also questions whether today's Israel is the biblical Israel. He gives reason to conclude, “It is simply not credible to make any direct appeal for the ancient promise of land to the state of Israel.”The strength of this little book is the study guide, set up for four sessions. I have seen many Christians unconditionally support the state of Israel without really thinking through the issue and the human rights actions of the Israelis toward Palestinians within the state. Reading this book and discussing the issues may be a good way to bring some reality thinking to the situation.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17YQIWVDAML27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149FP1IM#wasThisHelpful","R17YQIWVDAML27","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Jackie Roese was the first woman preacher in the history of Irving Bible Church, preaching her first sermon from the pulpit in 2008 to a packed house of 2250 people. That event caused ripples throughout the conservative evangelical church. In this book, Roese shares her personal journey.This is not a theological defense of women in the pulpit. Roese does not look at the various verses on the topic and give her interpretation. What she does do is share her own story.She gives us the background to her call to ministry, her childhood and her marriage. Her husband felt called to attend seminary. She felt called too and started taking one evening class at a time, also raising a family. This was at Dallas Theological Seminary where women were not allowed to take classes in preaching. After speaking at a women's retreat, she knew she was called to teach. She came on staff at a church, leading women's ministries. She expressed herself at meetings, trying to break through that invisible attitude that women were “less than” when it came to Scripture, doctrine, and theology.Roese explores a few topics in her book while telling her story. One was the concept of being a “received knower.” I loved her discussion. “Received knowers do not construct their own knowledge, they receive it. They depend on authorities to tell them what is right and wrong.” (18) They don't read any books the authorities don't recommend. They don't think for themselves nor do they look at opposing arguments.Another topic I really appreciated Roese writing about was how women and men see Scripture differently. Men tend to see it from an independent, analytical mindset. Women tend to see it with a relational, interdependent, or communal lens. That means a woman preacher will have a different sermon emphasis on a passage, something a man might never see.The turning point in her church came when the elders looked around and realized they were discussing an issue about women without any input from them. They invited women to a dialog and began to see things differently than merely from their privileged (male) position.Roese advocates for a new narrative, one “that more accurately depicts God's original plan and purpose for male and female.” (61) She suggests women get started in ministry by saying “yes.” Whether it is a kid's ministry or youth, “I tell them to take the opportunities in front of them and invest in their skills.” (22)This is a great book for those who want to understand what a woman experiences and feels when she is called to ministry. It is a very good personal account of experiencing that calling in a male dominated setting.Why lime green? Roese realized many women in church are pink. But she was not that way. She was lime green, warm, yet bold. Wooing, yet a bit dangerous. Passionate.

"Are you keeping track of life or is it whizzing by too fast for you to even notice? Are you living life or managing it?Stafford came to the point of committing to keeping track of life. She made a conscious decision to focus on what really matters, even when the insignificant or the distracting tried to derail her. She realized she wanted to be at peace with who she was and how she was living. She wanted to know she was on her path to true fulfillment.She wants each of us to experience that same kind of fulfilling life. She has marked out nine intentional actions to help us grasp what really matters in life. Here are a few of them.One action she suggests in her Creating Lasting Connections section is “filling the spaces.” She suggests looking for opportunities to focus undivided attention on what really matters, such as watching your children while they eat breakfast. There are scores of opportunities each day to focus, even if for a few seconds, on what is important. In the Living For Today section, she suggests “seeing what is good.” Look for the good in the situation, in the people, in the events happening. This is a change of focus from being critical to really seeking out the blessings before you. In Protecting What Matters, she suggests “leave a legacy.” Be an example of a life well lived to your kids and those around you.That's just three of the nine intentional actions she has mapped out for a hands free life. She has filled the book with touching stories illustrating the principles and giving us great examples of how they work. She includes affirmations to encourage and help establish new thought processes and then an inspiring meditation.She admits she doesn't always get it right. Readers won't feel like they are trying to follow a perfect example. We are all a work in process.Stafford found “that the most important things in life are not measured but are felt through the hands, heart, and soul of each life we touch.” I recommend this book to all who want to live freely and love fully.

"Francis of Assisi is one of those people in the history of the church that I've heard of but, like many, really did not know much about him. Goudge wrote that he was a humble and poor man who set out to walk as closely as he could in the footsteps of Christ. “Looking at him,” she writes, “we see what it means to be a Christian, and what it costs.” (2)This reprint of a classic that was first published over fifty years ago is a very readable and inspiring account of Francis' life. We read of his birth in Assisi in 1182. He experienced his first severe illness at twenty-two. He was touched when he was confronted with the reality of poverty. He gave to the disadvantaged. He came to believe that no man could truly love Christ without living in some degree of poverty. He would go to the nearby caves to pray, a mystic. He made a pilgrimage to Rome at age twenty-four. Upon his return he saw a leper and was moved to embrace him. He sold some of his father's cloth inventory and gave the money away. His father was not happy and had him temporarily bound.Such was the beginning of Francis' life. I was amazed at his odd behavior, such as throwing down his colorful clothes when his father sued for the money given away. God called him to rebuild a church so he begged for stones to use. He was misunderstood, mocked, and persecuted.Nonetheless, others joined his way of life, taking vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. They had to sell what they had, living with no property and in shabby clothes. He appealed to the pope for a new order, which was eventually granted. He went on mission trips, went on a crusade and visited Jerusalem and Bethlehem, upon his return finding that some of the brothers had betrayed him. He was able to restore the rules, but his health was in decline. He experienced the wounds of Christ in his hands and feet at one of his times alone.Not being a Catholic, I found it interesting how the Orders were established. Sister Clare established the Second Order. I was fascinated by the Third Order, allowing people to live in deeper devotion to Christ while remaining in their secular calling. Called the Order of Penitence, members had to give surplus money away, dress austerely, eat sparingly, and reject luxury.There were so many parts of Francis' life that were amazing. While on the crusade, he went to the sultan, Melek-El-Kamil, and witnessed to him. Francis talked to a hungry wolf, convincing the animal to live in harmony with the village he was going to attack.

"This novel is a good medical mystery. Some of the suspense deals with the issues of FDA drug approval and is relevant to medical research and drug success.The plot deals with a past U. S. President who, upon his return from South America, comes down with diphtheria. When he does not respond to the appropriate drugs, Josh, his newly appointed doctor, is puzzled. But then a lab tech tests the ex-president's fluids, he finds evidence of a very deadly disease. Someone infected the ex-president when he was on his trip. The race is on for an antidote.There is a little romance and a personal suspense thrown in. Josh has been dating a nurse that went along on the trip and she also shows signs of the deadly disease. So there is additional pressure on Josh to secure the antidote. We learn a little about the FDA and it's drug approval system and how that impacts drug companies and their research.The only aspect of this novel that was less than excellent was the motive behind the ex-president's illness. The reason, revealed at the end, comes out of left field. I did not feel it was hinted at in the novel so think it is inadequate.The novel is still a good medical thriller with a good Christian message included. I do appreciate that the author has included a note at the beginning of the book identifying which parts of the book are based on fact. There is also a good reading guide included.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IW1HJ15H745F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZDSXV0#wasThisHelpful","R2IW1HJ15H745F","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good Christian romance for older teens or young career age.Ten years ago Ben and Mari had one of those special summers. Love had blossomed at a summer camp. Even though Ben had written, Marie had never answered. Life went on but his  love for her never dimmed. Rebecca Fisher is the physical therapist Ben goes to when he wrenches his knee. She looks very familiar and Ben begins to wonder if she is the “Marie” he fell in love with.Becky has made herself into a new person. She's legally changed her name, moving on from the stigma of her past. When Ben comes into her office she wonders if he is the same Ben she fell for that summer, the Ben she has never stopped loving. Even if he is, there is no way she can allow him to get close to her. It is just not possible.The plot is the typical romance style: boy and girl love each other but there is an insurmountable obstacle preventing that love from being fulfilled. In this case, it is Becky's father. He is a well known Christian author who allowed people to believe that the examples of a terrible daughter he talked and wrote about was, in fact, his own daughter, Becky. Riding the wave of fame, her father never corrected the misapprehension. Her reputation ruined, she built herself a new life with a new name.This is a pretty good romance. The characters of Becky and Ben are well developed and realistic. Becky believes that love and marriage are not really possible for her. Ben wants to break through the wall Becky has built to keep him at a distance. Trust is necessary and Becky is just not there yet.I felt there was something a little “off” in the novel. Becky's parents know about the name change and are in frequent contact – her mother at least. It's her father's character and his relationship with his wife that seems off. I suppose a Christian author could allow his daughter to suffer so he could write best-selling books. I suppose a mother could allow her husband to devastate their daughter for fame. But something in those characters, the father and mother, just did not seem to go well in the plot.I always like to learn a little about a topic when I read a novel and in this one it was about the hungry in Washington, DC. Becky helps at a nonprofit serving the disadvantaged, many of whom do not have enough food for themselves and their families.Older teens and young career readers would like this novel. The issue of trust and openness is a major theme. Forgiving family members is an important concept in the book too.I received a complimentary digital copy of this book through The Book Club Network for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JYOR9Q7CEUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692457399#wasThisHelpful","R17JYOR9Q7CEUQ","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea how essential imagination is to our lives. Reading this book, even though it is an investigation of Lewis' use of imagination, made me aware of how we all use imagination.This book could be considered an introduction to C. S. Lewis through exploring his use of imagination. The authors identify many different styles and uses of imagination. There is realizing imagination, shared imagination, penetrating imagination, material imagination, primary imagination, generous imagination, just imagination, transforming imagination, and many more. The use or function of each kind of imagination is identified and then how it has been used in Lewis' writings.I was surprised by several aspects of this investigation into imagination. Spiritual growth requires imagination as we must imagine the stages beyond where we are. Imagination helps us understand the complex world we live in, a world more complex than our capacity to understand. Imagination allows us to view an issue from many viewpoints, like looking at something from a variety of angles, helping us understand it better. Imagination helps us sort out sensory data, making sense of experience. We can use imagination in an attempt to shape reality, seeing the world as it should be. And those are just a few aspects of the exploration of investigation.I was amazed at the importance and power of imagination in Lewis' writings. He was a master at helping us develop a deeper grasp of something through imagination. That imagination can give us fresh insight toward understanding a complex or illusive idea. Imagination can be used for evil just as powerfully as for good, as he clearly showed.I was impressed with this book for two reasons. The first reason is the fresh understanding I received about the importance of imagination. I use my imagination when I plan my garden for next year or plan a dinner for this weekend. Imagination helps me make sense of change, having a fresh application of old ideas to new challenges. My church board uses imagination when they contemplate a new ministry and how it will meet the needs of the church members or the surrounding community. I've come to the conclusion that we use imagine much more than I had ever thought.The second reason I like this book is because if gave me a new appreciation for Lewis and his writing. He was very effective in his use of imagination to communicate a concept. There are scenes from The Great Divorce that have stuck with me since I read the book decades ago.This is a good introduction to the writings of Lewis. People who want to understand why Lewis wrote the fiction and nonfiction he did would do well to read this book. The book would also be of good use in a literature class as it helps us understand the use of imagination in fiction and nonfiction too. The authors have included an extensive bibliography for those who would like to study further.I received a complimentary copy of this book through Handlebar for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HH4FLU36HWAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426795106#wasThisHelpful","R1HH4FLU36HWAW","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes an author can say more in a novel than can be said in a nonfiction book. That was the case here.The skeleton upon which the message of this book hangs is the story of Green Street Baptist Church and their pastor, Pete. Pete's been there five years, having taken over after the retirement of his very successful predecessor. Despite his tireless efforts, the church is now in decline. At a board meeting, Pete is asked to resign. He's shocked but has the sense to remember a conference he attended. He finds the old business card and gives an invitation to the man whose call it is to help dying churches.On that skeleton of a plot is quite an informative book. I was amazed at the amount of information I learned about churches. As a church board member and ministry leader, I've read tons of books about church – but nothing like this one. I read about the life cycle of a church: Movement, Monument, Museum, Morgue. I found out that every day ten churches close their doors for the very last time. I saw an example of real revitalization of a church. I read about the characteristics of a thriving church: Attractional, Invitational, Missional. I learned how nostalgia is a powerful force that quenches the urge to dig new wells and is a threat to the vitality of the church. I read about the power of unleashing the force of sacred imagination. I saw the possibilities of ministry outside of the church building. I found out what happens when men lead the charge.With some humor and a great deal of insight, Shupp has crafted a novel that taught me more about the vitality of church than most other books I've read. I highly recommend church pastors and board members read this book – yes, a novel. There are some thoughtful discussion questions provided and an additional section at the end that really explains the life cycle of a church.The concepts in this book are essential to maintaining the vitality of church today. I highly recommend it.Food for thought: “Being the church and going to church represent two radically different philosophies of ministry.”I received a complimentary digital copy of this book through The Book Club Network for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6OCB6JX7KLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y6M2C5E#wasThisHelpful","RM6OCB6JX7KLQ","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is there a relationship between cancer and hatred and unforgiveness? Barry believes there is.Barry is part of the pastoral care department at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Philadelphia. He shares what they do there and why. He believes, “The stress of unforgiveness negatively affects the immune system.” (14) Forgiveness, on the other hand, has a wholesome effect with long term health benefits.He tells several stories, relating individual experiences with forgiveness and cancer. He also looks at studies investigating the relationship of stress to health. While it cannot be said that unforgiveness causes cancer, it does seem to create a state in the body that is more susceptible to the disease. Cancer is a complex disease and Barry suggests a holistic approach to treatment, including forgiveness.Forgiveness is also a complex issue. It is not just saying it. “It requires a heartfelt change through which the anger and hatred are transformed into feelings of peaceful indifference or neutrality.” (149) It doesn't necessarily mean reconciliation or justice. Barry gives good insights into the process of forgiveness. There cannot just be certain steps suggested because the process is different for every person. It may require help from others in the form of counseling and support. Motivation is essential, he says.Barry says it is reasonable to conclude that, to the extent forgiveness creates psychological stress, the immune system is compromised. That sets the stage for health problems, including cancer.With that conclusion in mind, I recommend this book. While Barry is a Christian, this book is worth reading by those of other religions and the nonreligious too. As he points out, the concept of forgiveness is not limited to Christianity. It is a concept that those who desire wholeness and living well should practice.

"Our lives should look radically different because Jesus lives in us. But sometimes we feel stuck. Sometimes we are not living an intentional life – we're just lazy.Woerner has written about transformation, how to make progress and be refined by the Lord. The book is an encouragement to live out our faith in practical ways. She shares her own journey, revealing what God has taught her. She tells stories about her experiences and lessons she's learned from other authors. She gives practical steps to apply her suggestions to our lives. She has additional resources at the end of each chapter, including worksheets that can be downloaded from her website. (The worksheet page is password protected but the password is in the book.)She covers a variety of topics in the book: goals, getting rid of distractions, self-control, habits, boundaries, balance between structure and spontaneity, minimalism, friendships, hospitality, waiting, joy, contentment, influence, forgiveness, awareness, peace (and fear), comparison, health, rest (Sabbath), and margin (between our load and our limit)Woerner gives us good and basic encouragement on each of the topics. I really liked her insights on habits. She's read several books on the topic and gives good information and suggestions. Her suggestions are practical too. For example, here are the insights she has on waiting: 1. It refines our soul. 2. It demands our honesty. 3. It reminds us that with God, we are more capable than we know.This is a good book for people who feel stuck in their life and need an encouraging boost. While this book works well for individual use, I think it would be best to read it in a small group of trusted friends. Woerner reminds us that the refining process is messy. Having some friends along for the journey is a good idea.Food for thought: “Busyness is our answer for not making tough, moral decisions about where our time should go.”I received a complimentary digital copy of this book through Litfuse for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IF3DTRP110GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153POEAI#wasThisHelpful","R2IF3DTRP110GO","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Football is in the air. In small towns across America the bleachers are full on Friday night. But what if you are new in town and you really don't like football?Dr. Jess MacLeod was new to Last Chance, New Mexico. The California woman had decided to leave the bustle of California and have a practice in a small town. While people seem to be excited that there is finally a doctor in town, they do not hesitate to tell her they've been seeing a doctor in the next town all their lives so don't expect them to see her any time soon. Jess' frustration at trying to fit in only increases when everyone starts talking about the coming football season. One thing Jess does know about herself – she doesn't like football.The football issue becomes more difficult when Jess begins “seeing” Andy Ryan. He's a professional quarterback whose career being pretty much over, came back home to coach the high school teem. He's under pressure from the towns people to recreate the Glory Days of his own high school football past. A few losses to start off the season and the grumbling begins. And when Jess suggests one of his guys might consider academics a better way to get a scholarship than football, Andy wonders of if there is any hope for the two of them.This is a nice small town romance story for the football season. Last Chance is one of those towns where everybody knows everybody else and is related to half of them. I enjoyed reading about the small town atmosphere and the football frenzy.Jess is not a Christian and doesn't really understand the people she meets who are. I liked the elderly “Gran” who was treasured by so many in Last change. She is a great and godly woman.I recommend this book to those who like a pleasant romance without too complicated a plot. It is part of a series although it reads well on its own.

"Sheila Walsh has a heart for those who are hurting and that really comes through in this devotional.Walsh shares lessons she has learned from her own experiences, from people she has met, from children, and even from animals. These are encouraging devotions and would be good for those feeling overwhelmed or despair. People who have lost hope will have reason to hope again. All of us will be reminded of how much God loves us.Even though these devotions are powerful, they are also short. Walsh understands we're busy and adding one more thing to the routine may seem overwhelming. Each reading can be done in five minutes.I love Walsh's honesty. She tells us of her struggle with depression and being admitted to a psych ward. She shares her surrender after her reluctance to forgive another. There are many of her devotions that will impact each of us personally. They are like a light in a dark night.The format is simple.

"This novel is an enjoyable romance set in the snowy winter of Summer Harbor, Maine.Hunter did a good job of creating a tense setting as the novel opens. Eden and her young son are running from danger when they become stranded in Summer Harbor. A broken down car and a stolen wallet leave Eden desperately in need of a job. To the rescue is Beau, manager of the Callihan family Christmas tree farm. He needs someone to take care of his crotchety aunt as she recovers from a broken leg.That is the beginning of a romance fraught with misunderstanding and turmoil. I like how Hunter revealed bit by bit the tragedy that sent Eden on the run. Eden is a very believable character. Mistreated and betrayed, she is not ready to trust a man again. Beau is a sweet fellow who falls head over heels for her. The only trouble is – he already has a girlfriend.There are plenty of relationship struggles in this novel. The Callihan brothers are an opinionated bunch and Beau's controlling attitude is not always appreciated. The Christian influence is strong in the novel and even though the brothers fuss, they ultimately forgive and let love rule their relationship. The relationship between Eden and her son is precious. The young boy was traumatized by the tragedy and it was good to see the possibility of real healing for him.There is a bit of suspense in this novel too. Beau thinks he can protect Eden from harm but he under estimates the power of the bad guy. I thought the suspense scene a tad bit unrealistic but I still enjoyed that aspect of the novel.Something fun in this novel is the appearance of characters from another author's novel. Hunter and Colleen Coble are friends. Since Coble was writing a series taking place in Maine, the two have put their towns close to each other and share a few characters.One of my requirements for an excellent novel is that it not only entertains but informs as well. I was hoping I would learn a little about tree farming but that was not to be.I recommend this novel to those who like a well crafted romance with a little suspense thrown in. Get a cup of hot coffee or tea, though, as it is awfully cold in Maine around Christmas time.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34R9BLDYDQ7E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWOH2V4#wasThisHelpful","R34R9BLDYDQ7E7","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like getting a new book by Healy. She is such a gifted writer, I know her book will be entertaining and thought provoking, ranging from magical realism to suspenseful thrillers.This novel is yet again different from what I have read from Healy in the past. This novel centers on  a young girl, eleven year old Kate. She and various members of her extended family live in a lodge that has been in the family for a couple of generations. Originally a lavish get away house for an eastern couple, it is now a lodge and restaurant in the hills above Denver. It is also the place where good and evil meet in a deadly confrontation.This is a story about family. I really like Kate. She is an amazing young girl, protecting family members by keeping secrets. I liked Pearl too, a savvy elderly woman with such a treasured history, that she is not afraid to put her life on the line to save others. There are also other family members that are not so valiant. Like the lodge and cottages, they have hiding places where they keep their secrets.Interwoven into that family story are three others. One is a “family” of homeless people. We see what kind of a family that is when loyalty is tested. And another family, a father who is part of a gang and his twelve year old son who is being inducted into the fold. The gang members call themselves brothers and we see their family loyalty to each other too.All of these “families” come together at the lodge for a suspenseful meeting. It is during this time that truth comes to the surface and family loyalty is ultimately tested.I liked this novel just for its suspenseful conclusion. But I also liked it for the investigation into family and just what that means. I liked the characters, the strong Pearl and Kate, and the flawed men. I liked learning a bit about the incarceration of the Japanese in U.S. camps during WW II. I had no idea some sympathetic to American Japanese acted to protect them.I recommend this novel to those who like suspense. I also recommend it to those who like to think through characters' actions and motives, for there is much to think about. Those who like to see flawed characters find new meaning for their actions will appreciate the novel too. There are good Discussion Questions dealing with the meaning of family and family member interaction, so it would be a good book for a reading group as well.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2JPUBQ2GW9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401689604#wasThisHelpful","R1N2JPUBQ2GW9C","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book on apologetics is different. Rather than give arguments for the existence of God, Bannister looks at the arguments for God not existing. Are they valid?Atheists have become very vocal of late. In many Western countries atheism is seen as the default position. In fact, Bannister writes, “Many people assume that atheism is, indeed, the only position for somebody who wishes to be considered educated, sophisticated, urbane, and rational.” (6)The arguments for atheism just do not stand up to scrutiny, Bannister says. I love how he has us think through the arguments and other statements atheists have made. He clearly points out how to spot which arguments are good and which are bad. One of the tests is if the argument stands up in a different setting. He sometimes turns an argument of atheists around,using it on the atheists themselves, thereby showing it just does not work.Atheists demand evidence from Christians that God exists so Bannister turns the tables on atheists, demanding evidence God does not exist. Atheists claim their view is just non-belief in the statement, “God exists.” Bannister says that does not fly. An atheist must rather say, “It is true that there is no God.” Then evidence is required. He suggests atheists, “must recognize their belief for what it is and engage accordingly.” (35) He quotes extensively from atheist authors, calling them to intellectual integrity.This is a serious subject but Bannister is not overly academic. The book is very readable. In fact, he has a quirky sense of humor and inserts it from time to time. One might think humor inappropriate in a book on such a serious issue. As Bannister says, “Humour is powerful because it can prick pomposity and puncture delusions of self-importance.” (234) I love it.I really like how he engages the reader by starting of each chapter with a humorous story. As one continues through the chapter, it becomes clear the story clearly illustrates the absurdity of an atheist argument or statement.Bannister's aim is not to disprove atheism. He just wants to weed out the bad arguments so a more sensible dialog can occur. Is this important? Yes. Whether God exists or not is arguably the most important question there is. (27) Is it important to read and think through arguments on both sides of the issue? Yes. “After all,” Bannister writes, “it's only when you're willing to go down to the basement with a flashlight and poke around your foundations that you can really know whether what you're building stands on rock, sand, or simply hot air.” (204)I highly  recommend this book to atheists and Christians alike. Atheists will be challenged to truly think through their arguments. Bannister hopes this will encourage them to abandon bad arguments and engage the question of God's existence anew. Christians who have been intimidated by the forcefulness of the new and very vocal atheists will realize how inadequate their arguments really are.This is a foundational issue. As Ravi Zacharias says in the forward, “...without God as our ultimate frame of reference, we don't know who we are in essence or where we are in the great scheme of life.” (11)I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29993F0VYM7O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857216104#wasThisHelpful","R29993F0VYM7O3","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kirkpatrick is a master at creating a good fictional account of a historical event. In this case it is the Whitman massacre, sometimes called the Walla Walla massacre, of 1847.Our story centers on Eliza Spalding, daughter of Rev. Henry Spalding and Eliza Hart Spalding. They had accompanied Dr. Marcus Whitman and his wife in 1836 when they returned to the area deemed best for missionary work, near the present day city of Walla Walla, Washington. The Whitmans settled near the Walla Walla River while the Spaldings went a little farther east, at Lapwai (Idaho) ministering to the Nez Perce.On November 29, 1847, the Whitmans and eleven others were killed. Around fifty women and children were captured and held for ransom.  Details might be a bit unclear but it seems the Cayuse were upset at the measles outbreak that Whitman could not cure. There might have also been some Catholic missionary influence. Spalding, an anti-Catholic, might have believed the priests incited the Cayuse.Young Eliza was staying at Waiilatpu when the massacre occurred, attending a school for white children. She witnessed the horror of the massacre and was one of the scores taken hostage. She was forced to act as an interpreter as she was the only one who could speak the Indian language. She was ten years old. The British paid a ransom after thirty-nine days  and the hostages were rescued. Eliza was returned to her parents.The novel begins when Eliza is a teen. Her father, fearing an attack at their location, had moved his family southwest to near Brownsville, Oregon. Her mother died in 1851 and Eliza, being the oldest at thirteen years old, cares for her father and her siblings. She still has difficulty with nightmare like episodes, remembering the massacre. She meets Andrew Warren, a cattleman a few years older than she. There is an attraction between the two but Eliza's father is opposed to a marriage until Eliza turns seventeen.The novel progresses with Eliza's life. The reality of the massacre is revealed to us a little at a time as Eliza hesitantly mentions it occasionally. Interspersed here and there are excerpts from her mother's diary.I found the way the actual historical events of the massacre were revealed in the novel was a bit confusing. Eliza misremembers some of what happened, which is entirely understandable. Part of Kirkpatrick's reason for writing the book the way she did, I think, is to help us see how traumatic events are remembered and how they affect one's present life. I appreciate that but found the process somewhat confusing. I would suggest the reader look over a historical account of the massacre to have it already in mind when reading this novel.I am always amazed at the number of actual historical events Kirkpatrick is able to weave into her story. It brings to life a very troubled time in the Pacific Northwest. I recommend it to those who enjoy fiction based on historical fact.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EMDZWO42LZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGKXQ#wasThisHelpful","R26EMDZWO42LZ5","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great introduction to Christian prayer.The book is written by the Kendrick brothers and is inspired by their recently released movie, War Room. They know the power of prayer, having grown up in a praying family and attending a praying church. They've seen God answer countless specific prayers over the years.They want their readers to learn to pray more biblically and strategically. They give a foundation of Scripture and then explore prayer's benefits, purposes, and how God answers prayer. They remind us we need to prepare our hearts to boldly approach the throne of God in faith. They have great stories of prayer from the Bible and from Christians throughout history. They write about components of prayer and attitudes and habits that make prayer ineffective and those that make prayer effective. They also emphasize that salvation is necessary for true communication with God. The second half of the book contains good general teaching on the Christian life related to prayer, such as the condition of the heart, the will of God, the names of God, and other topics that are important to understanding prayer.The authors suggest readers commit to reading one chapter of this book a day. Doing that makes it a great devotional. The writing is down to earth. I really liked that. There is no super spiritual attitude or academic flavor to the book. I felt like the authors were across the kitchen table talking to me.I think the chapter I appreciated the most was the one on praying for other Christians. I so often say that I'll pray for someone and then really not know how to pray. They've included a sample prayer that is great. And then there are the fifteen suggestions in an Appendix.This is a good book for all Christians. New Christians will find a comprehensive explanation of prayer. Seasoned Christians may not find anything shockingly new (we've read about ACTS before) but will again be reminded of the necessity of prayer and its power. They'll also read the stimulating chapters on praying for their family, those in ministry and their church.The authors have included a prayer at the end of each chapter. They have also included a number of Appendixes. I really like the ones that have suggestions for specific prayer based on Bible verses. They have also included discussion questions for each of the 35 chapters.The authors are tired of disinterested churches making little impact on their communities. They're tired of lifeless Christians consumed by their own pursuits. They want to see revival and prayer is the key.I received a complimentary copy of this book through Icon Media for the purpose of an independent and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJO9372V4XQL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433688662#wasThisHelpful","RJO9372V4XQL9","A3JVE1D10L1CFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVE1D10L1CFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As the third generation of my family in Brooklyn who loved the Dodgers and Jackie Robinson with all my heart… and just like in the movies and story books… when I attended my first big league game with my Dad… I got to see Jackie and the “Boys of Summer” play in person. Because of that loving familial experience (the Brooklyn Dodgers were part of our family)… I have read just about every major book regarding this subject over the last fifty years. When I was notified of this book’s content… and the heralded author… I continuously counted the days till its release. I also worried as to whether there would be anything new or insightful that the world and I did not already know.I was not disappointed in the scope of the information… or by the almost poetic presentation of the author. (There was one shocking disappointment at the end… that I will make a personal comment on later) Roger Kahn benefited not only by being there side by side with Jackie during much of the historical time period…  and literally world changing events… but he also became a close personal friend… so there were many confidences shared by Jackie that not just any reporter would be privy to regardless of how much research one might have invested. The author and Jackie even shared a short lived attempt to write and publish a magazine together. One of Kahn’s strengths that I also enjoyed in his 1993 book “The Era”… was the way the author would set the tone of particular Rickey-Robinson events… surrounded by current world events. The in depth research by the author on Rickey may have even surpassed the information presented on Robinson. The author included a rare and personal record recording of an interview with Rickey that was very rare indeed in those days. The author also delved deeply into the library of congress where a treasure trove of Branch Rickey documentation resides.Another infamous “character” well covered and shown in a light not always detailed was Leo “The Lip” Durocher… who was literally the perfect manager to be fighting by Jackie’s side during this once in a lifetime  *Noble-Experiment-of-Baseball*.  Unfortunately… at literally the last minute Leo was suspended for the entire year by the commissioner of baseball.The” infestation” of Walter O’Malley into the Brooklyn organization is another large sub-plot that intertwines deeply with both main characters Rickey and Robinson… and with what I would term the “third-main-character”… the Brooklyn Dodgers themselves.  O’Malley is cast in a very, very, negative light… and that is not even including the fact that he eventually moved our “Beloved-Bums” to California. (I must add a personal note… our family moved from New York to Los Angeles the same year as the Dodgers) Many fans may not be aware that before that move O’Malley was the one that forced both Rickey and Robinson out of the Dodger family.This book was 99% tremendous… but now I must make my peace by responding to a “shocking and unnecessary” revelation by the author. Up to the second-to-last-page-of-this-book… this was an absolute five-star-rating! But what the author wrote on that page (in deference to the unwritten oath of non-spoiler… I can’t say what it was)… I’m deducting a star. More important than the star I removed… I (with my hand to the Lord) got nauseous… and clammy… and couldn’t believe what the author decided to reveal. (I suppose we’ll have to take the author’s word that it’s true). First of all in my opinion there was no need to include this in this book.  Jackie died in 1972… so forty-two years after his death… with no ability to defend himself… his reputation is tarnished.  On baseball terms I could only relate this despicable act as akin to Jackie’s first year in the big leagues when he promised Branch Rickey to turn the other cheek… and not fight back… even when they were throwing at his head… or spiking him everywhere and anywhere… but in subsequent years he was able to fight back with a vengeance. But there is no fighting back for Jackie… with this kind of friend… who needs an enemy?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4D0Q7WYYYU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623362970#wasThisHelpful","R1J4D0Q7WYYYU4","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to read a book that grabs you from the get go… and doesn’t let you go… even at the end… you’ve found it with “Working Stiff”. But be pre-warned… that you’re going to be grabbed in many different places. You’ll be grabbed by your heart… grabbed by your mind… grabbed by your soul… and you’ll definitely be grabbed by your stomach. Interspersed with all the aforementioned grabbing… periodically… you’ll also thankfully have your funny bone tickled once in a while. Judy Melinek is a forensic pathologist (and now also an associate clinical  professor at UCSF Medical Center… which blessedly coincidental is the location at which my life was saved during brain tumor surgery) and co-author with her “house-husband” T.J. Mitchell.The story of Judy’s travails following her dream of a life in medical care that started with the aim of becoming a surgeon… and having that derailed by the well-known inhuman hours demanded as an intern… that led to health issues… and the resulting career change led to her becoming a forensic pathologist… and hence… this terrific book. There are obviously certain down and dirty descriptions on singular events in her life’s work… that can’t be described in any way but graphically… and they are sometimes hard to take without even an imagined break by the reader. But what makes it tolerable… is that the author’s innate… goodness… and empathy… helps you “regroup”… and move on. Certain discussions are not masked in clinical medical mumbo-jumbo… they’re just said… “With an earthshaking crash, the derrick of a 383-foot-tall construction crane slams down on James Friarson’s head”… “His head looked like an egg you smash on the counter.”Some people are just born with ingrained empathy for the human condition… still others are blessed with the ability to… see… learn… feel… and grow in these areas… still others… may live through something so horrible and possibly debilitating… like Judy living through her Father’s suicide when he was thirty-eight-years-old… and he was the chief of emergency room psychiatry at Jacobi Medical Center. (Judy was thirteen)… some crumble… some become a special person that winds up truly benefitting society as a whole. Judy is definitely the latter.The detailed discussions of innumerable decedents… cover many homicides… many suicides… many being natural… many caused by surgery… some caused by malpractice… some non-definable.  But through it all… Judy is a wonderful human being… during the brightest of days… and the darkest of nights.The ending of the book is hard to summarize with the mere use of the written word. The end of the book is all about  9/11 from the coroner’s point of view… It is horrific! It is more than horrific… and it does something… as I try to put it into words… that can’t be defined as scary… or monstrous… it simply puts your feelings beyond human thought… or feelings… even this many years after. Long lines of refrigerated trucks… some for bodies… but as the author makes excruciatingly… yet tenderly…  clear… more so for parts… really less than parts… bits and pieces. The blessed human beings like the author… that never forgot… even for one exhaustive…  second… the domino affect… of humanity…a “part”…  could quite possibly trigger… is beyond description…","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLJU5VJA1O6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476727252#wasThisHelpful","R1FLJU5VJA1O6X","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is a little tough to write… so I hope potential readers/purchasers of this book read more than the first sentence or two. I have read a number of this author’s books… and like his style and his content. But there lies the rub… one of his books that I read was “In The President’s Secret Service”… and I not only read it… but I reviewed it… on May 5, 2009. This review that you’re now reading… is the six-hundred-thirteenth… that I’ve written and posted on Amazon. It so happens that the highest rated review I ever had out of the prior six-hundred-twelve… was “In The President’s Secret Service”… which as of this date… I have received four-hundred-twenty-four positive votes for. The reason I have written this preamble… is for credibility… when I tell you… that… though it’s well written… and entertaining… it is “vastly” similar to his prior aforementioned book. I feel bad pointing this out… since the author provided me with such enjoyment in the earlier book… but I feel I owe it to potential buyers… since if the roles were reversed… I would hope for the same honest interpretation… so I would have the opportunity to make an informed decision.I feel the author would have better served potential readers… if he released this book under the banner… “NEWLY UPDATED AND REVISED” “THE PRESIDENT’S SECRET SERVICE”… then new readers  could of course judge it on its own merits as a first time read… and people who  read the original one five years ago could make a personal educated decision whether they wanted to invest their time and money in an updated version of what they read before.I hope this helps potential readers.P.S. There are some great quotes and situations in this book… but instead of rewriting them here… you can just look at my detailed “first-read” review posted over five years ago.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEDVTZNNWE29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139210#wasThisHelpful","R2GEDVTZNNWE29","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read every major steroid/PED book related to sports since Canseco’s two books… including but not limited to “Game Of Shadows”…Radomski’s book… Romanowski’s book… the Clemens expose’(s)…  the A-Rod expose’… etc. … and I would rate “Blood Sport” right at the top of this list. The first thing potential readers should be made aware of is the fact that the authors cover much more than just the Biogenesis scandal. An awful lot  more in fact! Even James “Pud” Galvin in 1889 being involved with a concoction of “chopping testicles off live dogs and guinea pigs grinding the organs into a paste, refining it into liquid and then shooting the vile concoction under the skin.” Also included are the Pittsburgh Pirate drug trials… Canseco/McGwire/et al… Balco… and of course all the way up to the modern day Biogenesis fiasco. No detail is skipped… and the story flows like a raging river. The documentation is superb as players… dates… drugs… dollars… are  literally reproduced directly from phony Doctor… scammer… and unfulfilled dreamer… Tony Bosch’s own handwritten note pads.The main subject amongst many big name subjects is Alex Rodriguez… and the impunity with which he abuses the legal system as well as the moral system from the time he was in high school… is as disgusting as it was in all the other books I’ve read.  Ryan Braun comes off entirely despicable… not only with his lie after lie… while putting himself on a phony pedestal of truth… but in the way he attacked the employee who picked up and shipped his dirty urine sample… which by the way… “ACCORDING TO LATER REPORTS, THE URINE SAMPLE HAD COME BACK WITH A 20:1 RATIO OF TESTOSTERONE TO EPITESTOSTERONE. THAT WAS FIVE TIMES THE 4:1 MARKER THAT FLAGGED A POSITIVE TEST. BRAUN LATER SAID THAT UNION REPS, INFORMED OF THE FAILED TEST, TOLD ME THAT THE TEST RESULT WAS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN ANY NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF DRUG TESTING.”There was one other deplorable character trait that all these big name “busted” stars had in common… it didn’t matter who you were… related or not related… you or anyone available… would be thrown under the bus so quickly… without even a second thought… that in my opinion… just as appalling as being an illegal drug user… a cheater in every sense of the word… a liar… beyond any imaginable definition… that their absolutely appalling lack of empathy for any other human being… might be their worst character trait of all.Major parts of this book also shine a very dark light on the University Of Miami… U.M. … “The U”… there has been so much drug use there it’s almost hard to believe. Interviews with former players verify many facts… but the school itself and its coaches… don’t cooperate with the authors since as a private school they are not forced to. Suffice to say there’s a reason “non-Doctor” Tony Bosch eventually set up an office right across the street from the University.The behind the scenes look at how Major League  Baseball  has reacted since the Mitchell Report is not only intriguing… but shows that they really are trying to straighten out this PED mess… unlike during the asterisk era of the 90-‘s and early 2000’s. Many times this book reads like a great crime mystery… and though sports fans know the final outcome… just like in a good movie there are characters that are extremely hard to believe… due to moronic maneuvers… or G-d like complex… thinking they’re above the law. Amazingly baseball actually approved A-Rod’s drug use for a couple of seasons.The research on this book is stellar… the pacing is tremendous… and the entire story… whether you think you already know it or not is captivating. I recommend this book highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSQDFJAO2CMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954635#wasThisHelpful","R3QSQDFJAO2CMH","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is kind of a tough review to write... simply because I'm truly writing it from the point of view of the type of music I had expected... but I'm also trying to be kind to the artist by also offering up that people looking for another type of genre might see it differently. But in addition to that conundrum... I also feel no remorse/guilt in pointing out good and bad... period in this CD.I love the electric blues and bought this CD because that is the main anthem that this performer is listed under and there was very little true electric blues. Additionally in those few songs just when things would get cooking... all momentum and adrenalin would be stopped in its tracks by either a less than mesmerizing solo by the keyboardist... which at times sounded almost like an organist between innings at a baseball game... or by the bass player... which also was akin to putting the brakes to a fast moving freight train. At times it came across that Coco was almost being too nice to his band mates... and giving them solo time... that would have been much better spent with hard-driving-string-bending guitar work.Just like almost everybody...  I also enjoy good old fashioned old-time rock and roll... and there was barely any of that. There is great length to this double CD offering... approximately 116 minutes. But as mentioned earlier... much of that valuable ""live"" time was delved out to (wasted?) the support musicians.  One thing that I can say without an ounce of reservation is that Montoya has an absolutely beautiful voice (perhaps too beautiful for electric blues... I'm kidding a little here... but perhaps he could swallow some broken glass and have a more growly blues voice for some of the songs. Again... this is a little tongue in cheek.)... and his voice on every single song is exquisite. So though I rate this CD a three... people who enjoy a good voice with what I consider absolute middle of the road music would rate it higher. My suggestion for what it's worth would be to add more Montoya hard driving string bending guitar... a little stronger song selection... and be a little more ""selfish"" with the instrumental solos.P.S. I forgot to mention that the second day I had it the ""spindle"" in the CD case broke.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7ZXXS1683NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPW6OTK#wasThisHelpful","R1T7ZXXS1683NV","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an electric blues lover I at times take a chance ordering older recordings when newly released. There have been some good quality releases… but also some real disappointing stinkers. Freddie King who lived almost his entire adult life on the road playing the blues died at 42 in 1976… so there are not many options when it comes to Freddie. The voice recording quality on this CD is awful. In fact the liner notes say:“this is not a perfect recording, Freddie is a bit “off mike”.If I hadn’t highlighted some things on the cover I probably would have considered returning it. On the small plus side… this CD has a good choice of songs… with good blues length…. And though tinny… you get a good feel for the physicality of King’s string bending. But do not buy this for the voice. If you’re a real-real-electric-blues enthusiast… you might… just might… want to add this to your collection. I consider myself an enthusiast… but I wish I didn’t order this. I’m only giving it a 2 star rating because of the songs, the length, and feel for the guitar. But it’s a very weak 2.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9TC47CRP8MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0NANKO#wasThisHelpful","R1W9TC47CRP8MM","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a lifetime boxing fan… I believe this is a book for the ages. A glorious five year period encompassing 1971-1975… during which Muhammad Ali… Smokin’ Joe Frazier… and George Foreman… fought each other five times. The Heavyweight division hasn’t been the same since… nor has America… and the author does a “knockout” of a job explaining why.I have a very large boxing library and so I have read multiple biographies on the boxers that this story is built around. One of the things that makes this compilation so effective is that it concurrently follows each individual in depth… prior… to the big fights… during the big fights… and after the big fights. In previous individual biographies… rightfully so… those books only gave real in depth insight to the title character. Here the reader gets to consistently see and feel the growth or decline of each fighter as a byproduct of the multi-faceted domino effect each fight leaves in its wake.Avid boxing fans will also be pleased with all the detail on the corner men… trainers… sparring partners… promoters… including the despicable Don King. One interesting thing I learned from this book was the early influence that Sonny Liston had on George Foreman. The author’s writing style is exquisite… and his story telling during some of the big fights like “The Fight Of The Century”… and “The Thrilla In Manila””… is  so wrought with precise… delicate… but… razor sharp… blow by blow… descriptions… that you feel like you’re actually there... at… or in some cases… in the fight. In the case of the Ali-Frazier battles… “almost” to the death… you will almost assuredly forget where you are… and your sense of time… will have left you. These aforementioned sequences… to me represent some of the finest boxing writing… I’ve had the pleasure to read.The summarizations of the life styles and mindset of these three former champions … up through the present time… is at once… sad… happy… and surprising… when the final bell has been rung. This is a book worthy of a championship!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXD6IUFX7RY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306822229#wasThisHelpful","R2UXD6IUFX7RY2","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost died during brain tumor surgery on February 13, 2002. I have been blessed… and I appreciate every day I’ve been given…Someone reading  that at the start of a book review… would most likely think… why would you put that there? Because on page 174 in this soul touching… cathartic… (for the author… and people like myself)… book… former New England Patriot… and stroke survivor… Tedy Bruschi… tells the author: “Mark, don’t forget-you’re a survivor now”… So be proud of being a survivor. Always be proud of that.” The author is… and I most assuredly am. The author Mark Herzlich is a professional football player who was part of the New York Giants Football team when they won the Super Bowl. Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way… let me make clear… what is to me… the most important thing about this book… that every potential reader should know. Yes there is football in this book… and yes the author’s life has been built around it… but in order of importance for potential readers… I would probably list football way down on the list as to why you should buy it. If you are facing a health challenge that is life threatening… or you have a loved one… regardless of their age… that is facing a life threatening situation… or if you are an individual such as myself… who was literally faced with a life and death situation… where you didn’t know if you would be alive the next day… this book is for you! To read about someone in exacting detail… going through very much of what you have gone through… from finding out with virtually no warning that you may die… to your courage shaking first encounter (unfortunately the first of uncountable encounters) with an MRI machine… to describing.. the even worse feeling (feeling isn’t a good enough word)… that once you’ve got past the elongated first obstacle of finishing the MRI… to the unimaginable… and incalculable… length of time… till you get the results of your latest MRI… and believe me… from the exact second your doctor informs you of your tumor or cancer… from that exact microsecond in time…  your entire life… and your families entire life… has been changed forever… because… when you’re handed your original verdict… that started this entire journey to the abyss… of what your life has become… and may end with... it’s at times like this… regardless of what type of belief in the Lord you may… or may not have had… until this point in your life… I guarantee you… you will re-examine it from a different angle. The author… as in all other subjects in this book… discusses it openly… and honestly.It is difficult for me to decide on some of the words I use in describing this book… because when you are talking about cancer… and tumors… and life and death… certain words are distasteful for someone who has (luckily) lived through a situation like this. I don’t want to say the book was enjoyable… even though I couldn’t put it down. I… after much inner searching… would rather say… that it was re-affirming… that what I went through… what I felt…  faced… and accepted… as how I would face my “challenge”… was faced with an almost exact mindset of the author.Before… during… and after… Mark shares with the reader… his undying love and appreciation of the wonderful family he was born into. Another affirmation that I have stated an infinite amount of times… and I will continue for all eternity… is... it would be impossible to get through an ordeal like this without a loving dedicated family. My family was my twenty-two year old son.Mark’s ultimate reward… in addition to life… was a Super Bowl championship. My ultimate reward… was being able to share my son’s continued ascension into manhood… and two beautiful... feminine... angelic... Granddaughters... that I never would have met… If I didn’t win my fight.That’s what this book is about. From diagnosis… to treatment…to suffering…  to faith… to family… to goals and determination… and everything in between.Yes… there is football… but this book reaffirms… there are things more important than football.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQERQFU1PW20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451468791#wasThisHelpful","RCQERQFU1PW20","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walter hasn't always given a straight answer when asked if his music was the blues... but this remarkable triumvirate of Walter Trout Blues Media provides  a treasure trove of blues emotion for any electric blues fan... as well as a Walter Trout fan... or both. There really are three separate gifts to rate in this one exquisite package. The CD itself consists of twelve songs... of which ten... Walter wrote himself. Overall they are powerful... not only from a voice and guitar point of view... but the lyrics rightfully mirror Trout's current life and death battle. To be frank... coincidentally... the two songs that disappointed a bit... are the two he didn't write. (""Mayall's Piano Boogie"" and ""The Whale Have Swallowed Me"")  For fans that are aware of Walter's ills...  please rest assured... that his voice is still booming strong... and his guitar strings are still heavy... and bend like always.The second portion of this package... is the packaging and album credits and notes. This total ""enclosure"" could not have been manufactured and designed any better. The written material is actually stapled into the CD/DVD holders like a high end book. Lyrics are included along with a personal observation of every song by Walter. Also included as a ""bonus"" is the full first chapter  from Walter's soon to be released life story ""Rescued From Reality - The Life And Times Of Walter Trout"".The third piece is a forty-one-minute-seven-second documentary filmed in early 2014 ""The Blues Came Callin - The Walter Trout Story"". The production quality is A-1! I want to alert any fans who are not aware of Walter's physical travails... to be prepared...  to be taken aback. Walter does not hide from his condition... due to liver disease... he states that ""HE HAS LOST EIGHTY POUNDS IN THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS!"" Walter to his undying credit... uses his condition... and what caused it... in his lectures and performances geared towards young boys and girls (men and women) as a cautionary tale. He then plays the blues like he's the healthiest man in town.Despite the aforementioned physical decline... a couple of things stand out... like a beacon... in the darkest of nights... his blue eyes... and the blues soul that is flaming behind them. His eyes and the passion that emanate... from deep within his very soul... overpower his frail frame... constantly... throughout this touching... inspiring... and educational... documentary.Walter's life is traced from his childhood that included the horror of  a hatchet-wielding-former-prisoner-of-war-step-father...

"At least fifty-per-cent of my non- work life… when I’m not visiting my family is built around… and immersed… in the electric blues. I simply love it! I read about it… study it… listen to it… watch it… talk about it… and pass it on to other generations. Unfortunately…  there are just not that many new electric blues performers… and if there is… they’re not being publicized correctly. And… if truth be told… a couple of artists who do perform some blues… who have gotten some followers… and publicity… vehemently… and smugly… try to distance themselves… from being “tagged”… “An electric blues performer”!  I won’t dignify them… by putting their names here… but I will paraphrase  quotes from two of them… and if you’re into electric blues… you can probably figure out who they are: (One in response to a reporter’s question… “Do you consider yourself an electric blues singer… said”)… “I don’t define what I sing”… another… in response to a similar question… said: “I sing all types of music.”If you’re wondering why I’m broaching this subject… it’s because it is  so freakin’ refreshing… to have a CD release like this… that salutes the beauty… and power… of *TRUE-ELECTRIC-BLUES*… on so many levels!First and foremost there is the musical performance itself… which is “top drawer”… and I’ll get into that more in a moment… but just as important… there is a magical unsuspected (for an electric blues aficionado like myself)… inclusion of an “album-liner-insert-book”… that is written from the heart of Kenny Wayne Shepherd… “Confessing”… to his lifelong love of electric blues… and the very personal impact… through personal… biographical… anecdotes… that link him to… ALBERT KING (one of my two all-time favorite electric-blues guitarists)… STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN (my other all-time favorite electric-blues guitarist)…  BUDDY GUY (in my opinion… the greatest living electric-bluesman)… JUNIOR WELLS… B.B. KING… FREDDIE KING… BO DIDDLEY… MUDDY WATERS… JOHNNY GUITAR WATSON… MAGIC SAM. The short paragraphs shared from Shepherd’s very soul… not only tell why a song(s) was chosen for this  labor of electric-blues love… but also how some of these artists… truly impacted KWS’s very life.  Two examples that will add to any electric-blues devotee’s  treasure chest of knowledge are:“To say that STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN was a major influence in my life would be an understatement. He undeniably lit the fire inside of me to play the way I do; if it weren’t for SRV, there may have been no KWS.”“If I could be one person for a day, I would want to be MUDDY WATERS… One of the main reasons I didn’t sing on my albums for years was because I wanted to sound like MUDDY WATERS and couldn’t get beyond the fact that I didn’t.”Every song on this CD is tremendous… strings bend… keys are tickled… drums are played… electric blues… are sung the way they were meant to be…I would like to personally thank KWS not only for the music… but even more importantly… I want to thank him from the bottom of my electric-blues-heart… for standing up tall… and shouting to the world… how great the heritage of true-electric-blues… really is… and for sharing the IMPACT… that these great artists had on his life…And as my all-time idol Jackie Robinson once said… and these very words are carved onto his headstone for all eternity…*** A LIFE IS NOT IMPORTANT, EXCEPT  IN THE IMPACT IT HAS ON OTHER LIVES ***","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354W9QK2BLZBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IF6WRBG#wasThisHelpful","R354W9QK2BLZBM","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read and collected every episode of Spenser written by the late… great… original… Robert B. Parker… and if only for blind loyalty… to the man… that I personally honor… any… and every time… I’m having a beer with a friend… and the friend asks… “You want to have another beer?”… by replying… “WE’D BE FOOLS NOT TO!”That of course was one of my favorite Robert B. Parker quotes… from his near endless catalog of “snappy” repartee. When the master passed… I refused to buy and read a “stand-in’s” books… because of… if nothing else… true-blue-remembrance of a lifetime friend.  After all… think of how many roads… I’d been down with Spenser… Hawk… and the boys… and sooo many… unfortunately… with the most annoying female… in literary history… Susan. But luckily… there were also all those beers…. And all the classic… Spenser banter.Well… for a combination of reasons… not much good snappy literature available lately… along with the fact… that I at least… wanted to peak behind the door… of my old neighborhood… to at least get a taste… of the new life… of my old compadres… so I bought “Cheap Shot”.The story is built around a hard hitting… notoriously dirty… New England Patriot Linebacker, Kinjo Heywood. What surprised and impressed me was the fact that the author actually used the New England Patriot’s real name… as compared to fictitious team names as many novels do. They even referenced Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. Kinjo who was accused in the past of killing a man in a trendy nightclub… and paid off the family… now believes he has unknown people tailing him. And that’s when our hero Spenser is thrust upon the scene. Very soon after... Kinjo's son is kidnapped... and now things... are really off and running.After some “goody”… and “yikes”… retorts from Spenser… I felt I was back in my old stomping grounds. Of course there are multiple attempts by our hero to blind male and female alike… with his egomaniacal… megawatt smile… that falls on “blind” eyes… and of course the author always mentions his size… and bodily disfigurements… that scream out… boxer… bouncer… or bruiser… and we have Hawk’s trademarked broken English verbalizing… just like old times. And like a bad dream caught in an endless loop… unfortunately… there is also an overdose of New England’s most boring use of ink print… Susan.The story keeps the reader’s interest… and there is as much intrigue as you can expect from a Spenser tale… and of course you will always know about the weather… and the current turbulent lifestyle of local leaves…Throw in a “zowie”… for old-time sake… and just like visiting a Hollywood movie set… where the front of the buildings are  held up with some boards in the back…  if you briefly suspend introspective thought… you too can imagine that Robert B. Parker is back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOHU4AFLXSNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399161589#wasThisHelpful","R3EOHU4AFLXSNG","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can’t even control myself to get to the detail of how great this lifetime package for any true Allman Brothers fan is… without immediately telling you to buy it! Buy it for you… buy it and save a copy for a  XMAS gift… or a fellow fans birthday you know is coming up. This total package is an absolute steal at the current price. The audio CD’s are about 2 ½ hours as is the beautifully shot DVD. (Yes… the DVD is the full copy of the 2 audio CD’s!)As a longtime Allman Brothers fan… I’m sure like all of you… I have many… many… CD’s that have numerous songs that overlap… and are repeated on different CD’s. With other artists that may start becoming a problem.. but as we AB fans know… the old saying regarding our boys is.. “they never play the same song… the same way… twice!” And that’s a given… but even so… when you start listening… and hearing our old favorites… that we may have on two or three different CD’s… and it is performed by innumerable famous artists… from every walk of musical life… (along with Gregg on a few)…  the following sensations will overpower you… on a few… I actually laughed out loud… because it was like getting a new gift on each song… due to one song being sung by a famous country singer with a real deep voice… the next classic being sung… by a famous singer with a high-pitched voice… every one done exquisitely. Some songs were done so beautifully… my eyes actually misted up.It would be unfair to single out one performer as being better than another… mainly because… as each new song came up… it seemed better than the previous one… but I actually started listening to the CD from the last disc… and then jumped to the DVD and started from the beginning… and I’m telling you from my heart that… the song that I thought was the best… was just topped!One performance that I must point out… because it really tore up my emotions… was the eloquent performance by Sam Moore doing “Please Call Home”… he came out… looking like a little “older- guy” (no offense… I’m a little “older-guy” myself)… he was hunched over a little… dressed in a very nice looking blue suit jacket… and then he started to sing… and in 15 seconds… I said to myself… man… the Lord blesses different people… in different ways! The Good Lord… sure blessed Mr. Moore with his voice! As the song went on… his voice got even stronger… his voice rose… and dripped with emotion… Sam unbuttoned his jacket… the musicians on the stage… along with the sellout crowd… were lifted with each word and note… Wow!The musicians were fantastic with some tremendous solos… the camera work on the DVD was perfect… to tell you the truth… I was amazed at how much entertainment is provided in this package… at this price…  this entertainment extravaganza… is an exception to the ever growing rule… that the consumer will feel like he overpaid for what he bought.In closing… what a great tribute… to a Blues-Rock icon… sometimes these tributes are done with emotion… but done too late… after the star has passed on… but with Gregg Allman alive… present… and participating… this was done at the exact right time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZJ7QIT5L4VU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK7NC9G#wasThisHelpful","R3EZJ7QIT5L4VU","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a lifetime baseball fan… who’s read baseball books veritably non-stop for over half-a-century… it was a nice change of pace to read about the National Pastime (at least formerly… if not currently)… from a totally different perspective. The normal perspective is from either a player… a manager… a coach… a team executive… biased or unbiased sportswriters… etc. … but to be taken by the hand through the lifetime of a man who spent twenty-six-years in the Major Leagues as an Umpire… creates a number of unique experiences… that at times you don’t see coming. To follow the dreams of a young man… hoping to reach the Big Leagues… that evolve around the game of baseball… old habits… sway you into almost forgetting mid-stream… that you’re not reading about a player. And then all of a sudden… you’re being educated on the way umpires rotate all their positions on the field based on how many runners are on base and where the ball is… almost like synchronized swimming… albeit… one of the swimmers is wearing a face mask and shin protectors.Al Clark… along with being the only Jewish umpire in American League history… during his career  Major League Baseball changed from a team of umpires specific to each league… to one team of umpires that rotated through both leagues. Al takes you from his childhood in New Jersey with loving parents… all the way to the Big Leagues… with a late life detour into prison… for a bad decision… and association. The book is peppered with anecdotes of famous players… but truth be told… this reader… hoped for more than were provided. It seems that… perhaps… subconsciously Al still tried to heed the most important guidelines that his umpiring career was built around… not to care who won… and to blend into the background as much as possible… because the old saying is that fans don’t pay to come watch the umps and referees.Surprisingly… the most impactful part of the book… was his four months in prison. The author truly understood… and  insightfully shared… what the loss… of one of life’s  most valuable assets… freedom… is really like… even in a minimal security prison. So Al… may have tripped up rounding third… and been tagged out… but he certainly… got up… dusted himself off… and still made it home!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUDFAFQVR6FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803246889#wasThisHelpful","R3HUDFAFQVR6FR","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jerry Reuss was not a great pitcher...  nor was he a bad pitcher... but he was definitely more than just a good pitcher... because when you win *TWO-HUNDRED-TWENTY-GAMES-IN-THE-BIG-LEAGUES*... and that is more than the amount of games you lost... you are definitely above good. When you play twenty-two-years in the big leagues... and are one of only twenty-nine players to play in four decades... you are dedicated and committed to your craft.More importantly for potential readers of Jerry's autobiography... is that Jerry is a very good writer. I am an old school baseball fanatic... who has been a Grandpa for a while now... and I've been reading baseball books non-stop since I was eight-years old. I know good baseball books... and I know  mediocre baseball books. This is a very well written...  enjoyable... book... that covers all the bases of entertainment and enlightenment. Before my next statement... let me preface that I am an honorably discharged Viet Nam Era Veteran... and my daily thoughts... as well as actual speech... are constantly peppered with four letter words... so when I mention this next attribute... it's not because I'm a prude... but because I welcome the opportunity to recommend a baseball book to just about all age groups. Other than a handful or so of four letter words... this book is fine for younger... baseball fans... who are still young enough to dream... about one day having a career in baseball just like Jerry Reuss did... and I did... of course Jerry reached his baseball dream... and I didn't... but I still like to read about diamond and horsehide dreams that come true. One of the main beauties of this book... is that the author never forgot that he was living  his dream... all the way up to his last pitch for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1990 when he was forty-one-years-old.  Reuss takes you from his childhood dreams to his big league career that included stints with the Cardinals... Astros... Pirates (twice)... Dodgers... Reds... Angels... White Sox... and... Brewers.  Almost any fan (hell... he played for almost 1/3 of the teams) will find some personal insight to one of his favorite teams or players... and it's really interesting sharing anecdotes with some of the top managers of the 1969-1990 generation... included but not limited to Danny Murtaugh... Jim Leyland... Jim Fregosi... the incomparable Tommy Lasorda... and his memorable time with the one and only Leo ""The Lip"" Durocher... and others. The reader will rub shoulders with such clubhouse greats as Willie Stargell... Dave Parker... the great Dodger teams of the seventies and eighties... including the 1981 World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers... of which Jerry fulfilled a hallowed dream of pitching and winning a World Series Game... and a World Championship. (During... of course... the time that... ""Fernando mania""... ruled the world!)Through it all... Reuss... always tells his story... with the impish charm... of a lovable grade school goofball... and that's ultimately... the gift Jerry gives the reader... along with his career. Whether it's twice impersonating grounds crew personnel on the field... in the middle of actual league games... to forging Tommy Lasorda's signature on a note written on a baseball that actually got used in a real ballgame... to making a constant statement... by his actions... to potential young... baseball dreaming readers... that he invested uncountable hours and days... every year to getting in the best physical shape he could... to live his dream of playing Major League Baseball.I recommend this book to all baseball fans. It's a great story without having to ever dwell in the muck and mire... relating to sex and drug use that is so prevalent in almost every book nowadays.Note: on page 50 there is an historical mistake: It states that the Cincinnati Reds were in the World Series in 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1976. This is incorrect. In 1973 the National League representative in the World Series was the New York Mets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J5YMNXDZN4ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803248970#wasThisHelpful","R2J5YMNXDZN4ID","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My families first three generations in America... of which I am the third... all came from Brooklyn... and the Brooklyn Dodgers weren't just a team to us... they were literally part of our family... and we were part of theirs. Jackie Robinson was literally a G-d in our home... with the rest of the ""Boys Of Summer""... headed by Roy Campanella... Duke Snider... Gil Hodges... Pee Wee Reese... Don Newcombe... ""Oisk""... Furillo... and the others ... all on pedestals. As the decades fly by... the world  rightfully pays more and more... homage... to the brutal... despicable... living hell that Jackie had to go through to break the color line... while still performing at a Hall Of Fame  level.  It of course was no picnic for any of the other black ballplayers that followed... such as Campy and ""Big Newk""... and the other brave souls on other teams throughout both leagues. (Not to mention what Jewish ballplayers such as Hank Greenberg had to go through... and as I learned through this book what anti-Semitism Sandy Koufax had to face from his own teammates... on a team that had broken the color line eight years earlier. Amazingly... and even more inspiring to me... a member of the Holocaust and post-Holocaust Jewish generation... it was the black ballplayers on the Dodgers that befriended... and defended young Koufax from the prejudice that openly existed in their own clubhouse... let alone throughout the entire Major Leagues!)What a lot of the general population... both fans and non-fans... don't fully appreciate... is the fact that when Jackie broke the color-line in baseball... he was not only representing... and being deeply supported... from their very soul... by the black population... but also fervently... by the Jewish population... and other minorities whose lives were savaged and diminished by prejudice. Jackie truly carried ""all"" our dreams on his broad shoulders for equality... and the simple dignity of being treated as a human being. All that... while ducking ninety-mile-per-hour-baseballs thrown at his head (before there were batting helmets no less)... being spiked on the base paths... and actually being spit on by opposing players when he was on the bases... and to constantly hear every degenerate... despicable... epithet... spewed from the lowest of lowlifes... all while he had to keep his solemn promise to Branch Rickey to **TURN-THE-OTHER-CHEEK** FOR TWO YEARS! As hard... and as near impossible... that would be for any human being... who has a heart that beats... has a spine... and red blood in his veins...  imagine a man like Jackie... whom Hall Of Fame teammate Duke Snider said ""was the most competitive man he ever saw in his life!""When Jackie was given the green light to stop turning the other cheek he fought back in every way possible with a vengeance. He also was not afraid... to use the world as a pulpit... whether in the clubhouse... on the field... before congress... everywhere... that he wanted racial equality... and wanted it now!!! Many said he even saw prejudice where there wasn't any...And then there was Campy... Roy Campanella... a three -time-National-League MVP... who followed Jackie to the big leagues. Back in the Negro Leagues Jackie and Campy were friends... but jealousies... and totally different personalities... drove them deeply apart. I tip my hat to the author... since... even though I have read just about everything under the sun about the Brooklyn Dodgers... and I knew there was friction... and tension... once they were both on the Dodgers... I never knew it was as bad as the author portrays in this tremendously written book. The author describes the conundrum early on... when he describes a similar paradigm in the early civil rights movement... way before Jackie and Campy came on the stage... and that was the difference between Booker T. Washington who like Campy years later... had a ""accommodationist philosophy""... and William Edward Burghardt Du Bois... ""the first black to receive a PhD at Harvard... whose philosophy of direct action placed him at odds with Booker T. Washington but inspired the black activists who came of age during World War II.""... this is exactly the scenario that became Jackie and Campy. The author sets the reader up for a glorious... invigorating... story... that is built perfectly around this conflict.Campy was loved by everyone... black and white... he was the ""quarterback"" on the field... as he managed the pitchers from behind the plate. But... much to Jackie's chagrin... Campy would never speak out against prejudice... he would never take a public stand... because his mantra was to be a great ballplayer... and a good person... (despite his ""womanizing"" which is one of the reasons that Branch Rickey picked Jackie to be the torch bearer) and ""eventually""... things would change for the better. Jackie... said the waiting is over! Things should change now! Jackie stood up... and spoke up... everywhere... and all the time... and it rubbed some people the wrong way... especially Campy. While Campy was making friends... Jackie espoused... ""he'd rather have respect than friends!""Perhaps my favorite quote from Jackie Robinson is: ""A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.""About sixteen years ago my son was jumped by ten thugs... when he was going to go back to school I had to go with him to the principal's office where the principal and the campus cop (yes a cop... not a security guard) started lecturing me that my son shouldn't go to certain drinking fountains... or parts of the campus where these thugs may be... I interrupted them... and said: ""My son isn't Jackie Robinson... he doesn't have to turn the other cheek... when he comes back to school... it's your responsibility to protect him...  and if you don't I'll be in the parking lot with a baseball bat...""Around that time my son's Grandfather... was in a serious accident which paralyzed him... and eventually led to his death... I took out a picture of Roy Campanella... in a wheelchair... in front of a wall completely covered with awards... including his three MVP awards... with his big friendly ""Campy-Smile""... and I told my son that other than my Dad... who had gone through an excruciating ending of his life... Campy was the most courageous guy I knew... and we could all learn from that.So... as you can see... both men... Jackie... and Campy... though as different... as day and night... have made an impact on lives!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MLSRF3TQG3QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803246331#wasThisHelpful","R1MLSRF3TQG3QC","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have had the opportunity to visit the NBA Hall of Fame… one of the things you’ll see are displays dedicated to teams during specific times that were considered *DYNASTIES*… One of those dynasties was the 1980’s Showtime Lakers. Before I ordered this book… let alone before I read it… I looked at my personal library and counted over twenty books regarding the Lakers. I at first said… how much more can there be on a team from over thirty years ago… and then I reminisced about how I had enjoyed three other books I read by the author Jeff Pearlman on… the Dallas Cowboys… Walter Payton… and the steroid cheat… Roger Clemens. I ordered the book… and as this review will confirm… I am thrilled that I did.What makes this book so worthwhile… even with the knowledge of what I read in all the prior books I owned… and in addition to attending many of the Showtime Lakers games in person at the Fabulous Forum… and the fact that I had even played in numerous pickup games against a number of the Laker players… were three main facts… first… Jeff Pearlman invested his time and energy in an exhausting amount of piercing… in depth interviews… secondly… his writing style is smooth yet exhilarating… the reader never gets the feeling as with many other  authors… that they’re just trying to fill additional pages… and the third reason… is the fact that “time” itself… over thirty plus years… over a quarter of a century has passed… and that means literary morals have changed… and what is considered acceptable in everyday journalism has changed. So thirty years ago when a written word was published… there were moral limits as to what could be written. Some examples are… in the past an author might write that Kareem was not a friendly guy… but today you can quote someone like CBS reporter Pat O’Brien as saying: “Once you accepted that Kareem was a “P”… you could get past it.” (Note: there are no abbreviations in the book… but it has been my experience that Amazon won’t publish my reviews if I spell out what is in the book… some things never change!) The author can also state unequivocally that “Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hated white people.” You can also have quotes regarding Jack Kent Cooke the man who owned the Lakers-The Forum-The Hockey Kings-and-The Washington Redskins… and who sold the Lakers to Jerry Buss… from Hot Rod Hundley… who said of Cooke… “The number one “A-H” who ever lived!”This additional literary freedom is why even if you have over twenty Laker books… many covering this time frame and period… written by everyone from Magic… to Riley… to Kareem… to writers who spent their whole careers covering the Lakers… this book is almost like reading about the same fantastic dynasty with societies blinders removed. It’s all here… from the sale of the Lakers… to Magic’s megawatt nineteen year old smile… to Kareem… snarling… moping… and growing old… to Riley wearing out his welcome… to the women… the drugs… and with the author leading the “story-telling-fast-break”… the reader will feel like he’s James Worthy… filling the lane… out on the wing… as the author passes you one gem after another… at full speed… and like “Big-Game-James”… you will never break stride… as you score a great championship read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIJ003XYHMGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592407552#wasThisHelpful","R1WIJ003XYHMGC","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an absolute lover of Electric Blues… and within that rarefied category… an avid fan of the Allman Brothers… the only hesitation I had before I ordered this CD… was the fear of getting a product that did not stand up to today’s sound quality. I’m not talking about the talent of the Allman Brothers… that is unquestioned… I’m referring to some of these old remake-reissues… that sound like they were recorded with a rusty nail… through a wool army blanket! I’m very happy to report that the sound quality is excellent.  This is a can’t miss… must buy for all Allman Brothers fans… for the lovers of Electric Blues… for lovers of Southern Blues Rock… and lovers of good old Rock And Roll. This double CD provides over sixty minutes of cookin’ music on one CD… and over seventy-five minutes on the second CD.The instrumentation… and the voices… are purely at the top of their game. There is a multi-page foldout liner note piece… that is pretty interesting as these type of things go. If you read it before playing… I believe it will add to the feeling of “time-and-place”.In summation… this is “LIVE” music… played the way it was meant to be… by one of the greatest live groups in the last 50 years… you will be sorry if you wait before ordering!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A66R12M87EZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNTUR1S#wasThisHelpful","R2A66R12M87EZF","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"August 22, 1965 is a day that has lived in disturbing infamy in the history of Major League Baseball. That was the day San Francisco Giant… future Hall Of Famer Juan Marichal… lifted his bat over his head… and landed a crashing blow… to the head of Los Angeles Dodger catcher Johnny Roseboro… in the middle of the game. As a baseball loving child growing up in Los Angeles… I was sitting on the floor in front of the TV… and watched the insanity play out… right before my very eyes.This book does a fine job of not only laying out what happened on that fateful day… but what unique roads… both Johnny and Juan traveled leading up to it… and then the author… dutifully follows the diverted paths of each man… in the aftermath.  And perhaps with the finality… of justice… that can only be delivered… in the completion of a poem… how peace… or what can only be defined as an attempt to discover peace… reunites these two adversaries’.As I started reading this book… much of what the author wrote seemed very familiar to me… and not just the facts on their own. And the reason I found was based on the following: Out of 277 pages… over 60 pages are sources… bibliographies… and index. In reviewing these pages I found that I had read many of the books he quoted. As a reader… the author’s due diligence made me feel even better about the book. As mentioned… even though I had read many of those books… it impressed me how he so cohesively mixed the two life stories into such a readable sequence for both men… and masterfully… led it like rivers flowing into the same ocean… at the conclusion.Part of the reader’s journey is to learn what different backgrounds and personalities were formed and ingrained in each man… so the reader can intelligently share the unique heart and souls … that were pulsing… through the two combatants draped in enemy uniforms. Much is made of revolution(s) in the Dominican Republic… and the riots… and unrest… in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities. Those situations of course… tempered things… but that should not be rationalized as the only causation. These were two individual human beings… that made individual decisions… which impacted each other for the rest of their lives.---Mistakes in the book: On page 41 the author states that in the 1960 National League MVP voting that Roberto Clemente finished behind teammates Dick Groat and Ralph Hoak. There was no Ralph Hoak it was Don Hoak. On page 161 the author states (regarding Roseboro) “this game that had given him two World Series and four All-Star Games.” Roseboro was in four World Series… 1959-1963-1965-1966… and the Dodgers won in 59-63-65. On page 197 the author states; “Through 2013 fourteen African Americans have managed in the majors, including Cito Gaston and Ron Washington, who both led their teams to two World Series championships”. This is wrong. Ron Washington has never managed a World Championship team.Mild annoyance: On a couple of instances the author states that Marichal won more games than Koufax in the sixties decade. He fails to mention that Koufax retired after the 1966 season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JAHXK7OIPV36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762787120#wasThisHelpful","R3JAHXK7OIPV36","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The life story of sports agent Leigh Steinberg is fast- compelling- reading... with names he signed up as clients... as recognizable as headlines in the last forty years of sports sections. The look inside of the psyche of young All-American ballplayers... as well as millionaire-billionaire sports executives is almost hypnotic for true fans. The fact that Leigh also uses a never ending supply of ""ME""... ""ME""... ""ME""... tends to get a tad burdensome at times... but as me and my old buddy Dizzy Dean like (d) to say... ""It ain't bragging... if you could do it!"" But Leigh should also keep in mind what my dear departed Mother used to say... ""Rick, don't break your arm patting yourself on the back!""Meanwhile back to the book. The writing style is in such a relaxed easy to read format... that I stopped about a third of the way through and  looked to see who the ""co-author"" was... and when I saw it was Michael Arkush...  I soon realized that I had read two of his other books... ""The Fight of the Century: Ali vs. Frazier March 8, 1971""... and... ""The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul"". So the ""co-author"" should get a lot of praise for converting this ""made"" for telling life story... into an enjoyable reading experience.Leigh's childhood growing up in Los Angeles included loving the Brooklyn then Los Angeles Dodgers... and idolizing Sandy Koufax for his presence as a tremendous role model for all Jewish kids growing up playing and loving baseball... guys like Leigh and I... as I grew up at the same time... in the same place... with the same heroes as the author. Leigh's parents were always extremely supportive of their children and among other posts... his Dad became principal of Fairfax High... which coincidentally the basketball team I was on at North Hollywood High School... played Fairfax a couple of times every summer. His Father instilled in Leigh the firm wholehearted belief that he should always do things to improve the plight of other people... and that became the heart of his offerings / demands... with every potential client he ever attempted to sign... to give back part of the millions he negotiated for them  in some charitable fashion.Perhaps the best... most delightful parts of this book are in the short nuanced... insiders look...  at not only the individual differences of the star draft choices... but of the different idiosyncratic character traits of the general managers and owners who sat on the other side of the desk during these financial mano-y-mano negotiations. One of Leigh's cardinal rules... was to try and never have his client or their families sit in on the direct bitter give and take negotiations until an agreement was made. The reason for this is obvious... the team owners and general managers will rip and denigrate... the potential signees... in an attempt to get the contract price down. An agent like Steinberg understands this... and even after warning players and parents alike... to stay out of the ""ring"" during these brutally fought championship fights... a few parents and sons refuse to listen... and these lead to near disasters... though these disasters... are the funniest and most interesting parts of the book for the reader. An example is when Jeb Blount... a University of Tulsa quarterback was drafted by the Oakland Raiders... his Father Peppy not only had played football at The University of Texas... but was elected to the House of Representatives... and later became a county judge.  Peppy demanded to be present at the negotiations... and with all of Leigh's selling techniques... he could not sell Peppy from staying away. Well Al LoCasale the Raiders representative did as predicted... and started attacking Jeb's credentials to ever make it in the pro's... to the point where Peppy (the Dad) said: ""Oh yea Al""... ""Peppy, who was maybe 6'6"" and 275 pounds, suddenly reached across the table and tried to strangle LoCasale, who was 5'5"". I (Leigh) used every ounce of strength I could muster to squeeze in between them, it was barely enough.""Then there was the time quarterback draftee Jack Trudeau had to be restrained from punching Indianapolis Colt executive Bob Irsay in response to Irsay's comment: ""You will never take us to the Super Bowl. You don't have the balls to take me anywhere. You're nothing but a mediocre quarterback."" And even mild-mannered-Mormon-Steve Young had to be escorted out by security along with Leigh during a negotiation with Bill Oldenburg the owner of the Los Angeles Express.There are two small things that I as an old-school-fanatical fan would like to point out... that in no way takes away from this delightful read... one is in telling one of his stories regarding Young and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers... he says several of the players advised Bo Jackson against signing with the team... and he intimates that that's why Bo instead signed with the Kansas City Royals baseball team. Well... I disagree with that assumption because I heard Bo Jackson himself say he wouldn't sign with Tampa Bay because when the ownership flew him in for a visit while he was still at Auburn... that they had cleared it with the NCAA and it was strictly kosher. It turns out it wasn't... and they hadn't cleared it... so Bo lost out on some of his beloved college baseball eligibility... and that's what he never forgot or forgave Tampa Bay for.The second thing that kind of sticks in my craw... is when Leigh states he wasn't motivated by $$MONEY$$. Come on now... what do you do for a living???But those two things are simply things I'm mentioning like a sport fan talking while sharing a beer or two with a friend. This book is five stars and will be enjoyed by any true sports fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VR0N89ZN74HG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030420#wasThisHelpful","R1VR0N89ZN74HG","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The life story of Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News is a deep meaty subject for first time author Gabriel Sherman. He has obviously done a ton of research and the story is augmented with detailed notes. I saw the author on CNN and he mentioned he tried to contact Ailes numerous times for his assistance but came up empty. Despite that fact the book rings true tied to his named quotes and documentation... If anything the book at times is a little top heavy and doesn’t make for fast reading… but it does make for interesting reading… and with all the tabloid assassination out in the world today… the reader gets the feeling that what he’s reading is pretty solid. I also read “Roger Ailes: Off Camera” by Zev Chafets last year… which moves faster but I believe the goals may have been a little different.What’s interesting comparing the two books is that two main areas surrounding Ailes’ life is one-hundred-per-cent identical as told by both authors… the impact on Ailes’ life by his Father… and that *LOYALTY*… is a sacrosanct quality when working with Ailes.Roger’s career trail is covered from the entertainment side as far back as when he produced the Mike Douglas show… to his work with politicians ranging from President Nixon to the elder Bush… and many more in between and after… in fact “Between 1980 and 1986, Ailes propelled thirteen GOP senators and eight congressmen into office”… is almost unbelievable. His jumping back and forth from entertainment to politics… included CNBC… before his historical career with Fox… as well as the fact that he started so many different management-P.R. firms with so many name changes that you would need two separate score cards to keep count.Between this book and the earlier one mentioned… I have read and learned enough about Roger Ailes to last a lifetime.

"To say the electric blues is a passion of mine is to put it mildly. I listen to it constantly... watch videos of the legends... I attend concerts... and I research and read about it... and recently I'm very proud to say I've actually started an electric blues historical mentoring program through word of mouth. So when I state unequivocally that Buddy Guy is the greatest living electric bluesman... I don't do it lightly. The fact that Buddy is my favorite living artist will not affect my giving a completely honest review.I received Buddy's latest release ""Rhythm & Blues"" yesterday... coincidentally on his SEVENTY-SEVENTH-BIRTHDAY. If anyone on this planet has found the fountain of youth... at least when it comes to a singing voice... and the strength and dexterity of the fingers that bend the oh-so-heavenly-strings-of-an-ELECTRIC-BLUES-guitar... Buddy Guy has not only found it... he has jumped in head first and immersed himself with this magical electric blues elixir... and thank the Lord... it seems to be indelible in every molecule of his body and soul.This double CD is testimony to the fact that hardly any man alive has such a powerful voice that was simply pre-ordained to sing and feel the blues. If someone were to say his voice is that of a man half his age... I would challenge someone to produce a few of these blessed individuals. When it comes to guitar sound... if you are a real... real... student and lover of the blues... you also know that only a select rarefied few in history... such as **ALBERT KING**... *STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN**... have a guitar sound that you cannot only identify immediately after just a few string bending notes... but those same few notes... make the hair stand up on the back of your neck... and goose bumps rise to attention on your arms. Well, Buddy has attained that status while still walking on the face of this earth. This entire CD has Buddy's telltale... ""HEAVY-STRING-BENDING-REVERBERATING*... call to arms... and he wields his powerful axe... as if he's bringing a flame thrower to the place.A few examples of Buddy's perfect melding of blues... his life... and his aspirations... can be felt in the following ways: mentioning Muddy Waters... and B.B. King... getting after women... regardless of his age... whiskey... love for his Mother... defining... and redefining the blues... and...A song entitled ""I Came Up Hard""... that I personally identify with... and if you know Buddy's real life story... you'll know why he does too.And how can you not absolutely love a song that has all the following references in it... Windy City... Chicago... Halstead Street...  Comiskey Park... Wrigley Field... Soldier Field... Al Capone... T-Bone Steak... and the blues! (""Meet Me In Chicago"")And now a few personal comments that doesn't change the FIVE-STAR rating... but just cleanses my electric-blues-soul.The song ""Messing With The Kid""... is way... way too short. It's as short as a 45 RPM record from fifty years ago. Kid Rock and Buddy just start cooking and it's over. By the way... what a great duo that would be for a whole album! The last song on the first CD ""Rhythm Inner Groove""... is 34 seconds long and shouldn't have even been put on there in the first place. On the song ""What You Gonna Do About Me""... Beth Hart takes up where she left off with Joe Bonamassa... and rockets even higher! ""Evil Twin""... with Steven Tyler and ?friends?... is a double barreled growling blues masterpiece.I have been to numerous Buddy Guy concerts and am getting tickets to the one he has coming up in the bay area in a few weeks. I'm taking my son... to keep the true electric blues passed on to the next generation... and I'm taking my electric blues"" mentoree"".Buddy Guy is a once in a lifetime or two electric blues legend. Listen to him... see him... if you had a chance to go back and see Babe Ruth in baseball I'm sure you would!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU0FBNAOK91AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC3DGSK#wasThisHelpful","RU0FBNAOK91AS","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a large part of my personal library is made up of books that fall into the following category... Mafia... organized crime... FBI... profiling... and serial killers... I have a lot of experience with books of this genre. In reviewing books of this type I try to act as a sounding board for all types of potential readers... so I have tried very hard to gear my recommendation on this book from multiple points of view... from the view of an experienced reader of this type of book... and  from the point of view... of a reader who may have thought of taking the literary plunge into this dark area... but hasn't actually stuck a toe in this exciting cesspool as of yet.This book  centers around Greg Scarpa Sr...  a despicable... soulless... serial killer... of the innocent and guilty alike. So devoid of what might pass as even a minute bit of a human soul... Scarpa Sr... admits to not bothering himself with keeping track of how many people he killed... once he got past fifty! Though  at first blush... it would seem that a less than human individual who killed this often... couldn't possibly add any other ""intangibles"" to his M.O..... that could make him even less desirable to take up space on this planet... this biological mistake... finds numerous additional ways to bring bile up the back of your throat. As one Mafia story after another is written that ends up... in a now altogether similar ending of... ratting out their family members... (Omerta... is simply a word that doesn't exist... and makes all the old ""blood-pledges""... seem as childishly ridiculous as the tooth fairy)... but this lowlife Scarpa takes it to a new low. Instead of ratting out every member of their family at the end... Scarpa Sr.... ratted out everyone from the beginning... and continued to do so for decades upon decades. And as unbelievable as that... he was actually paid by the FBI for his spineless Benedict Arnold in the Mafia performance. Scarpa was a multi-talented-lowlife-snitch. He not only ratted his ""brothers"" out to save his hide... he also ratted them out to help his advancement in the Mafia. He would simply rat out any competition he might  have had from  within. He ratted out... with the truth... he ratted out with lies. And the second biggest rat in this book... is the FBI!  The FBI knew Scarpa Sr. was not only continuing on his criminal endeavors... but he was also continuing to murder with no inhibition... all while the FBI looked on... all of this against the entire creed of the FBI.As I mentioned earlier... I have read innumerable books on this subject... and two of those were*GASPIPE*... and *MAFIA SON*... both by different authors... and the latter... was about Scarpa's son...  Greg Jr. ... who gave another perspective on his Father... and his own attempt to help the United States fight Al Qaeda from inside a maximum security prison... and the three books intermingle well if you've read the other two.  But here's where I will try to look out for both types of potential readers... this book is so well documented... based on newly released documents... which verify much of  what  has been told  before... that at times the author... due to the fact that he's proving and documenting  literally everything he writes... slows down the story at times... to where it's more like a court reporter reading back testimony... as compared to a fast flowing story... which many of the good crime books I've read... come across as. Now I find myself in a dilemma... I like the fact that the author ""proves"" everything he says... and I really like the way the author at times states... I'll prove that more in chapter ""X""... but sometimes it just gets tedious as he lists countless FBI ""airtels"" and ""209's"".In addition to Scarpa Sr.'s... murders... lying... ratting out associates...  and performing other countless crimes... he also finds time to be married to two women at the same time... and also have a common law wife. There are so many things to hate and despise Sr. about... but at the same time... you have to hate the FBI and all it stands for... as they allowed so much murder and mayhem to continue... in the name of what??? Justice??? After reading this book... that's a word the reader will have a hard time computing... not only in the same sentence as the FBI... but the same book.The story starts out very interestingly in explaining that Scarpa Sr. was ratting out the Mafia even before the infamous Valachi ever sang like a canary in front of the world... and before the landmark ""Valachi Papers"" was even published. The author makes the case that it very well may have been Scarpa Sr. who fed all the information to Hoover's FBI... and Hoover may have used that info to his advantage to get illegal wire taps. But from there... it becomes a very well documented court transcript. I applaud the author for his diligent research.... But if you're expecting a high speed fuel injected ride through the history of the Mafia... you better make sure to pack some snacks and a change of clothes... because it's a very long... slow ride... through interesting territory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DDO6SPTA48X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061455342#wasThisHelpful","R13DDO6SPTA48X","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a full blown electric blues lover and an amateur ""reverse-engineering"" electric blues historian who greatly enjoys following the influential links backward and forward of the masters of this genre... I want to first thank Walter Trout wholeheartedly for having the passion... the emotion... and the great common sense to dedicate an album to the *LATE-GREAT-LUTHER-ALLISON*.Any existing fan of Luther will love this ""album"" on multiple levels. Of course the fact that this album brings his name, memory, and talent forward to the present day... and thereby making it possible that some of Walter's current fans may become aware of Luther's electric  blues creativity... that unfortunately... like many electric blues greats... didn't get the coverage and respect due them in America... and to hear a different powerful voice... with a different guitar sound... with the benefit of greater technology... could be like hearing an old favorite with a new coat of ""blues"" paint.Walter's voice wears its age well... as the guttural... and heartfelt... passion for Luther and the blues itself... comes through loud and clear.The sounds that emanate from Walter's guitar are extremely thunderous... and when teamed with the ""bluesy""... urgent... and innate... soul... that the listener cannot help but absorb... you get a real-time-duality... of emotional impact. If you knew of Luther's greatness... your heart saddens for his departure... concurrently... you're warmed by the thought of  Luther's love affair with the blues... being passed on... and when the very essence of your love for the blues... is titillating the very cockles of your heart... you realize how much Walter's performance means to him. He's performing for the world... while simultaneously sending a special prayer of thanks and remembrance to Luther Allison... in blues heaven!--------------Walter, if you read this... how about a similar tribute to Albert King or Stevie Ray Vaughan? I can only imagine based on this CD how unbelievable you'd do on those. P.S. Very cute the way the CD looks like an old-time 33 rpm record.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HHQXX4T0BC44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C81MX8Q#wasThisHelpful","R3HHQXX4T0BC44","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me tell you why I ordered this product. I have a fifteen year old Walkman that I listen to all my favorite tapes on when I sit out at the pool. Even after fifteen years the sound is nice and clear... but the little door that opens to put the tape in fell off about six months ago... and I put a few rubber bands around the player to hold it on and it still works. I just got tired of taking the rubber bands off each time I changed a tape... so I looked on Amazon to see if they still had players like this... and that led me to this product. I read the reviews and OVER half the reviews said it was a piece of junk don't order it!  I thought... hey it's $13.00 what are the odds of it being lousy. 50%??Do not ignore my warning that's about to come... the way I ignored the other reviewers! I got my shipment yesterday... opened the box... and low and behold... other than the manufacturer's name on it... it was exactly the same as my fifteen year old rubber band model. Same three buttons, same battery opening... everything the same. I put two batteries in and the new player started spinning around fast... spinning around slow... making whirring noises like a lawnmower plugged into a crashing jet engine. I tried two or three tapes... after first playing them perfectly in my ""rubber-band-relic"". The new player is a piece of junk... and is now sitting on my front step waiting for UPS to pick it up and return it to Amazon.As a public service... with empathy for other human beings who value their time... do not do what I did... listen to the other reviewers... and now me... do not waste your time and money on this product!","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28577B02AJCA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HI89CS#wasThisHelpful","R28577B02AJCA6","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're an electric blues fanatic and spend half your free time looking for cooking electric blues performed and created by a living performer... not named Buddy Guy...  like I am... then this new CD by Popa Chubby is worth your time and money. (Note: my reference to Buddy Guy... so it's not misinterpreted... is because he's the greatest living electric bluesman... and when he releases a new CD  of new songs... you don't waste time you just buy it!)The ""Chubmeister"" emanates good old fashioned pulse pounding electric blues... and you can absolutely... feel... and absorb... his visceral... love of the art. To try to give an analogy normally used in professional sports... (my other passion) you can tell... he'd play for free... though like all professional ballplayers... he'll still take the money. Chubby at times bends the strings in homage to the greats... he at times teases the strings... to where the only definition regarding his musical sound... would be its ""rolling""... and he still finds time to... treat his instrument... so delicately... it almost sounds like it should be in a symphonic orchestra.If you're new to Chubby... or if you've sampled his music off and on... over the years... you... like... I... will be surprised... impressed... and at times... almost be in awe... of his voice. To try to paint a verbal picture for you... if you remember what Meatloaf sounded like during his glory years... Chubby at numerous times on this CD... sounds like that... with an extra ""DOUBLE-DOSE"" of diesel empowered guttural reverberation... and more often than not... if you pay attention... you can hear a slight extra emphasis of sound that is Chubby laughing... ogling... or turning his nose up at society that feels they're above us street-fighting-every-day-blue-collar-types.There are 12 songs of which 9 were written by Chubby... and that always scores extra points with me... as the feeling put into the performance... seems to dig deeper... into the overall belief and feeling between the performer and the listener. Some are such great roadhouse blues... that you'll think you have gone back in time over 25-50 years... but just have better stereo equipment. There is also a great ballad or two... and a song that will remind you of Chuck Berry... and one entitled ""FB"" Boogie (sorry for the abbreviation Chubbs... but I'm afraid of the censurer)... that will remind you of ZZ Top.Now... as for the ... AND 1(?)... in my review title... there is an 8- minute- 57- second instrumental remake of ""Over The Rainbow""... that is both befuddling and at times beautiful. It starts off like it might be Jimi Hendrix in his ""Star Spangled Banner"" performance at Woodstock with a different song... then gets beautiful... and instrumentally goes in many different directions.To summarize... if you love electric blues... and realize that nowadays finding not only a talented musician... but a talented musician... with a great voice... and add to that combination... an artist... who loves and respects the blues... then you'll realize that finding that combination... is harder to find than a balanced budget in Washington DC... and then you'll realize your decision of whether to buy this CD or not is already made!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDB8NKQQ0ON4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BO0O7LI#wasThisHelpful","RDB8NKQQ0ON4Y","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read Phil Jackson's other books, along with ones written about him... and this one is really a nice icing on the cake. Records have been broken... egos have been inflated... deflated... worshipped... and mocked. And I'm not talking just about Phil's. I'm talking about Michael Jordan's... Scottie Pippen's... Jerry Krause's... ""SHAQ""'s... Kobe's... Jerry Buss's... and everyone above... beyond... and in between.Phil goes back to his childhood in North Dakota and his strict religious and spiritual upbringing. The author does a very nice job in describing how he and his brothers went down different roads than originally paved by his parents who were preachers... but he does it in a manner of utmost respect and understanding. Many times Phil mentions his spirituality... and in lightning speed... he explains that is much different than religion.Jackson's time playing for the New York Knicks under his mentor and coaching idol Red Holzman rightfully shaped his professional life... in fact Phil dedicated this book as follows:**FOR RED HOLZMAN, TEX WINTER, AND ALL THE PLAYERS I'VE COACHED WHO HAVE TAUGHT ME SO MANY LESSONS. **As a lifetime basketball fanatic... and as a player in my day who played with and against many players who became NBA players... it is very apparent to me... that Phil's legendary... unmatched... coaching career... and achievements... were not only shaped by Coach Holzman... but just as importantly by the teammates he had during his playing career with the Knicks. The core of those players included Bill Bradley... Walt Frazier... Willis Reed... Dave DeBusschere... Earl Monroe... Jerry Lucas... Dick Barnett... and others... stand in time... as one of the most intelligent... totally TEAM oriented champions in history. That's the team Holzman built... and Jackson became part of... and that participation in mental and physical greatness... never left Jackson's... heart... mind... and soul.Obviously the entire book is built around Phil's ""Zen"" spirit. As any knowledgeable fan who buys this book would likely expect... there is as much Zen psychology and psychoanalysis... as there is basketball. But luckily for the average sports fan it actually starts fitting in pretty smoothly once you get rolling into the book. There's also many comparisons in Phil's estimation... between the greatness of Jordan and Bryant... there's also surprisingly direct... without trying to rewrite history... how Jackson really felt during the ridiculous battles between ""SHAQ"" and Kobe while both were on the Lakers... both before... during... and after... the Lakers three-peat.  It might surprise a few readers what Phil wanted done... and who he recommended getting rid of... and who he recommended keeping. Phil also does enormous justice to the talents of Scottie Pippen and the probably irreplaceable part he played in the Bulls six championships. On the Laker side... he also shouts the praises of Derek Fisher's role both on and off the court in the numerous Laker championships.One thing that I find kind of amusing is that despite all the Zen this... and Zen that... it was a number of fights that seemed to have made a big impression and impact on Jackson's career.  One was a 1966 fight between Willis Reed and the Lakers (I remember listening to that fight... I mean game... on the radio... described by the late great Chick Hearn) when Reed punched out or threw to the floor every Laker within range... and then in 1968 another Knick brawl... this time with Atlanta's Lou Hudson... in which future Hall Of Famer... Walt Bellamy didn't back up his teammates and was subsequently traded... and then of course... there was the fight between Jordan and Steve Kerr in practice...Well... it's all there... from a religious upbringing in North Dakota... to brawls and championships in New York... to more greatness and titles in Chicago and Los Angeles... and only Phil Jackson can mix quotes from Steve Jobs... ""It's more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy""... with quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche...

Save your time and money.First let me address a couple of items that you are probably hoping have changed... but haven't.* The scar through Glitsky's lips still burned white with frustration. ** The daily specials at Lou the Greek's were still awful and nonsensical... yet they eat there ten times per book.** Despite the cuts in Dismas' staff... his perennially sour...  long-suffering... humorless... receptionist/secretary... Phyllis... still works for him. ** And yes... of utterly... utmost importance...  the author dutifully states ... ""the pearl-black cast-iron pan that hung from its marlin hook over the stove. ** The overplayed... over stayed... shtick...  of  District Attorney Wes Farrell's daily anti-establishment-pun-humor tee shirts... now has the same impact as the smile on the headless horseman. *The carryover characters are dull and boring such as Hardy's marriage patterned after Ozzie and Harriet...  including date night... which pretty soon will have to start earlier to take into consideration they will both probably need walkers... but they would probably be getting to dinner earlier now anyway... to take advantage of the early bird specials like Seinfeld's parents.But putting all of this aside... I have to state for the record (it's painful not giving away the spoiler... that is actually a spoiler of the entire book)... this is the worst... most ridiculous... ill-conceived... non-sensical... ending I have ever read... written by an author above the schlock category.If halfway through a Perry Mason episode on live TV... if the producer was told... hey there's an emergency... and instead of having twenty minutes left to finish this episode... you only have one minute... they could have come up with a better ending.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2MA5SNFE3VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476709157#wasThisHelpful","R2S2MA5SNFE3VD","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Red Smith is inarguably one of the ten greatest sportswriters in history... and it wasn't just for the near half-century that he blessed the world with his pristine prose... that ranged from Ebbets Field... to boxing canvases'... to pristine lakes and rivers... to horse tracks... to many... many bars in between.  When I was a kid of eight years old and started inhaling sports books and biographies and encyclopedias...  almost every one had a quote from... or a reference to... Red Smith... so his greatness will live on for eternity through innumerable hardcover archives.  He could make you laugh... he could make you cry... and his columns ranged from his anger with a cowardly Jersey Joe Walcott... to the death of Babe Ruth... to his one ""sportly"" participation... fishing... and his otherworldly use of words could actually tie such diverse locales together as if they were born to. One great example is somehow... almost magically connecting a heavyweight boxing match to the pursuit of a trout:""On a cast across the brook, the fly was swept close to the concrete abutment. In the clear, swift water there was a flash of pursuit, but the attacker merely pawed with a light jab, then turned and fled like Jersey Joe Walcott. Neither insult nor bribe could tempt him back to fight like a man.""Oh, my Lord... what a blessing... the invention of words... for Red Smith... and I'm sure the almighty creator of words feels he was blessed by Red Smith!There are over 500 pages in this book... and over 150 priceless columns from Red Smith... they are so spectacular... that they can make a sports fanatic weep... and jump for joy simultaneously... and the same can be said for a college professor of creative writing.  There are two ways I can see enjoying this book... the first is reading a few sports columns at a time... thereby savoring such a precious priceless collection... or putting your head down... and reading one column after another... like there may never be another... and after a couple of days you realize you didn't stop at times and places you thought you would. My plans were for the former... but I wound up with the latter.In addition to the boundless treasure of rarefied literature provided by Red Smith within... this book also contains another rarity...  a stunning introduction by the editor Daniel Okrent... that means something... that touches you... in the knowledge of the undulating respect... and awe... that he views Red Smith with. Mr. Okrent tells you what qualities of Red... he deems most inspiring... and gives just enough examples to titillate your desires to jump in with both eyes... heart... and soul... without ever giving away too much.The columns are broken down into the following categories: BASEBALL 1934-1951 - SPORTS IN THE FORTIES - FISHING FOR TROUT - SPORTS IN THE FIFTIES - BASEBALL 1952-1961 - SPORTS IN THE SIXTIES - FISHING FOR BASS - SPORTS IN THE SEVENTIES - BASEBALL 1962-1981.A copy of this book should be enshrined in multiple Halls Of Fame.. and it should also be used as a text book in creative writing classes in multiple institutions of higher learning!Note: I originally finished my review with the sentence above... but I actually had a page folded back to remember in the book. Since the editor listed this quote in his introduction and it certainly didn't diminish the emotional and intellectual impact for me... I don't believe it will do anything but mesmerize any potential reader. It's Red Smith's opening sentences in his infamous column  after the New York Giants defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers with Bobby Thomson's ""shot heard round the world"" in the 1951 playoff decider:""NOW IT IS DONE. NOW THE STORY ENDS. AND THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL IT. THE ART OF FICTION IS DEAD. REALITY HAS STRANGLED INVENTION.

"As a born and raised Brooklyn Dodger to Los Angeles Dodger fan... whose family moved from New York to Los Angeles the same year as the Dodgers... let me first state that this is a long overdue tribute to what is now the twenty-fifth anniversary of *The-1988-World-Champion-Los-Angeles-Dodgers*! The author has done a wonderful job in creating a finely detailed... both statistically... and intimately... behind the clubhouse doors... portrayal... of how the truly miraculous drive to the 1988 World Championship was accomplished both on the field and off.The sub-title of this book is ""Hershiser, Gibson, and the Improbable 1988 Dodgers""... and ""The Bulldog"" and Gibby""... are rightfully... and truly... highlighted. From Hershiser's record-setting *FIFTY-NINE-CONSECUTIVE-SCORELESS-INNING-STREAK* which broke Hall-of-Fame Dodger great... and coincidentally... one of their announcers... during this historical year.... ""Big D""... Don Drysdale's... Major League record... to Kirk Gibson's... emotionally... and historically... reverberating...  World Series game one winning... pinch hit homerun... that has been selected as one of the ten greatest moments in baseball history... by many historians and publications.  Along the way ""The Bulldog"" Hershiser won the **CY YOUNG AWARD... THE WORLD SERIES RING... THE NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES MVP... THE WORLD SERIES MVP... and the much heralded... SPORT ILLUSTRATED SPORTSMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD. Gibson in addition to his ""one-for-the-ages"" World Series pinch hit game winning homerun... also won the regular season National League MVP award... and he rightfully won it for not only what he did on the field... but what he did in the clubhouse... and on the practice field.It was pretty well known the stand that Gibby took right at the beginning of spring training that year... when a practical joke was pulled on him that he refused to accept as the way to build a championship team... and he literally challenged the whole team including manager Tom Lasorda... but the story of **THE SHOWDOWN**... that took place in the Dodger clubhouse in July after a tough loss to the Cardinals... when he physically challenged Pedro Guerrero... and a few of Guerrero's ""little buddies"" from the Cardinals... who made the mistake of entering the Dodger's locker room... while Kirk Gibson was on ""watch""... is an all-time baseball classic! And this book is full of such beautiful behind the scenes baseball drama. Without giving away too many details... one item that really surprised me... was that one of the conditions that had to be met to sign Gibson... was that he had to talk to Steve Sax before he made his decision.  Coincidentally... one of the big surprises in this book was the almost universal, unlimited, compliments regarding Sax's enthusiasm... hustle... and love for his teammates. I met Sax once after his playing days and that's exactly the way he was in private also. It's great to know that there really are some guys that are good on an off the field... with or without the cameras rolling.This is a well-rounded book that covers stars at their peak... stars that are almost folk-heroes... like Fernando Valenzuela... on their way down... (and here's a great stat for true old-school baseball fanatics.... Fernando average 266 innings pitched per year from 1982-1987... and had 255 consecutive starts!)... players that never hit their original projected stardom such as Tim Belcher... but after looking deep within themselves... came to a self-awareness... that allowed them to have their moment in the sun.I can go on and on with great moments presented in this book... but let me also follow-up on the ""BUT"" ... in my review title.The story of this miraculous year is told in date sequence... which of course makes sense. EXCEPT... for Hershiser's six shutouts.  For an example you just got done reading about the game on April 30, 1988... and the next page is September 4, 1988... Hershiser's first shutout in the streak... and then you go back to May 10, 1988... then later on you're at May 26, 1988... and then you go to his second consecutive shutout on September 10, 1988... and then back to June 3, 1988... and so on... throughout the book. It just makes absolutely no sense... and destroys all continuity every time it happens. I can't for the life of me understand how the author or editor would allow this to happen. The second maddening thing is how many times the author uses the word ""reflected"" when quoting subjects in the book as they are interviewed.Then a head scratcher which must have got past whoever edited the book. On page fifty-two the author writes: ""In the Dodgers' third, Sax doubled, stole second, and scored on an errant throw."" Please tell me how Sax could have doubled AND THEN STOLE SECOND??One last thing on the critical side. I was trying to look up the Steve Sax incident in the detailed index in the back of the book... and guess what?? Steve Sax is missing from the index. Maybe when he doubled and stole second... he also stole his name out of the index.Putting these few things aside... I would still highly recommend this book. Especially as I ""reflect"" on the joy my son and I experienced during the 1988 baseball season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPDFKV3PNN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600788068#wasThisHelpful","R2CPDFKV3PNN3","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earl Monroe came to the NBA by way of South Philly... through Winston-Salem State... becoming not only one of the greatest players in NBA history... but surely becoming one of the most exciting players... in a unique and different way... than simply excitement. Though excitement can be defined in many ways... just like the beat of a song can be described... but... a- smooth- free-flowing-jazz-jam-session-... is almost impossible to describe... after the fact. You had to be there in order to be swallowed up in its one-of-a-kind-soul- immersing- stupefying-splendor!... And that was what it was like to witness one of Earl-The-Pearls magical moves at full tilt in a basketball game. Earl would say many times... how can the defensive player know what I'm going to do... if I don't even know... as I'm doing it!Earl's early life is told in a kind of haltingly... described manner... that perhaps could have been written in a smoother style. The phrase ""you know""... ""you know what I mean""... ""know what I mean""... ""you know""... is used literally between fifty-to-eighty times in the first hundred or so pages. (I tried to ignore it after that.)  Earl had a Mother he loved with all his heart... a Father that disappeared for years out of his life... and of whom Earl told his friends was dead... and a cast of Grandmother... aunts... and cousins... that were every type of criminal... from the numbers rackets... to gang members... to one cousin that according to Earl stood (I believe?)  on top of a vehicle spraying machine gun fire everywhere. Note: ""I believe""... is also a term that Earl uses quite often in describing things from the past.Earl  describes many different sides of prejudice... and being the way things were during the sixties in America... every day brought a different angle that prejudice may affect a human being... and not just black Americans. I credit ""The-Pearl"" with great honesty and integrity when he also quite clearly describes some of the worst prejudice being black on black... based on the darkness or lightness of your skin color.When Earl was young he liked other sports as well as basketball... in fact one of his greatest childhood sports moments was seeing Willie Mays' classic over the shoulder catch in the 1954 World Series. But when Earl decides that basketball is his life's passion... everything in his world is dedicated to being the best. I should correct that... as he still had a passion for clothes, partying and women. In fact... I wish he would have shared a little less regarding his sex-life between the ages of eight and eleven.His years at Winston-Salem-State playing for the infamous coach Clarence ""Big House"" Gaines... gives great detail as to the finishing touches of ""The-Pearl""...coming to fruition as a one-of-a-kind-force-to-be-reckoned-with on the hardwood. Note: potential readers who are true old school fans... will get a kick out of a few of the other nicknames Earl picked up along the way... including:...*THOMAS EDISON*... ""because  of the way I invented moves and stuff out on the court.""""The-Pearl's"" subsequent climb to basketball greatness is adorned with all the names such as Gus Johnson...the original backboard shattering high flier... who was  one of my idols growing up... and of course all the names on all of the jersey's hanging in the rafters at Madison Square Garden.  Earl of course, as history shows... proved the pundits wrong by teaming up poetically in the Knicks' backcourt with Clyde Frazier... while only needing one ball.From the cover picture with Monroe starting to swoop down court with ""Mr. Clutch""...  Jerry West in pursuit... to an inside picture of ""The-Pearl"" shooting over Wilt in an All Star game... this is a wondrous... but somewhat bumpy trip... down old-school NBA memory lane.I could tell you more... but you would've had to have been there... to fully appreciate it. After all so much of it was magic!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQWH8IDS2UJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609615611#wasThisHelpful","R3VQWH8IDS2UJJ","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The poster itself looks exactly as displayed in the little image insert... but the problem that a buyer should be very, very, careful of... is when it arrives. The poster is packed so... so... tight inside the thick shipping tube... that it is very difficult and nerve racking to try to figure out... AND... successfully accomplish... opening the tube and getting the poster out without damaging it in any way.The way the distributor packaged it was like the poster was a second skin inside a thick tube. There was no way to easily open the tube... and no easy way to remove the poster. I held my breath and took a number of minutes getting it out. There has to be a better way to package and ship. My whole investment in time... money... and excitement... became nothing more than a crap shoot.I f they simply had rolled up the poster tight in a smaller cylindrical size than the thick hard to open tube... and put two rubber bands around it... and let it move around a little inside you could have simply opened the end of the tube and let it slide out.If you were able to simply pop open the end of a tube and extricate the valuable poster by turning the tube on its end everything would be fine.I guarantee you... your heart will be in your throat when you try to get the poster that you invested your money and your excitement in out of the suffocatingly tight tube.

"I'm sure anyone contemplating reading this book already knows who Lenny Dykstra **WAS**... and I can't emphasize the word *WAS* more. There is very little about his playing career in this sordid story... and there absolutely should not be any more of the short glory days that Dykstra experienced with the Mets and Phillies in this book. It wouldn't matter if Dykstra's playing career had doubled Babe Ruth's and Cy Young's and Lou Gehrig's careers put together... his post playing career life... is so despicable you want to stop and take a shower every couple of pages. Dykstra becomes no better than human excrement right before the readers eyes. Dykstra is a racist... a misogynist... a drug addict... a thief... a fraud... a disgustingly unkempt example of a wasted human being. He should have been taken off the conveyor belt of human beings by a quality control supervisor long before he had the continued ability to ruin people's lives.Despite his more than full-service prejudicial ""M.O."" described above... he harbored no such prejudices against any possible human being that he could rip off. He lied... misled... stole... forged... documents... credit cards... stock information... mansions... offices... cars... planes... hotels... meals... and more from people in any walk of life... rich... or poor... black... brown... white... male... female... young... old... strangers... and even innumerable members of his family. He even forged documents to steal part of his son's Major League signing bonus. Scum-bag-sociopath-Dykstra... had absolutely no prejudice whatsoever... when it came to stealing from other human beings... or in dehumanizing them.His deviant behavior could range from stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Wall Street executives... to purposely filling expensive hotel toilets with non-flushed feces... simply to gross out poor hard working janitorial workers. He sexually abused women who replied to job opportunities... and he did this under multiple aliases.Suffice to say Dykstra was aberrantly mis-wired in the factory of life and human decency. The fact that he admitted on and off... that he used steroids during his career... is a microscopic point... that is almost insignificant... since he should ... more importantly... be  suspended from life... which being that he's in prison... he basically is... and the hell with baseball.How bad is he? Los Angeles Police Department Detective Juan Contreras ""who has been a street cop during the L.A. riots and had encountered many members of notorious gangs, such as the Blood and the Crips, says Dykstra is a ""total sociopath"" and among the top three most egregious criminals he's come across in his twenty-four years on the force. I've met a lot of gang members that have more ethics than this guy, he says.""If a single penny of this book went to Dykstra I'd tell you not to buy it. But the author who had not only worked for Dykstra... but was also at the top of the list of the poor souls who worked his ass off for Dykstra based on a ""pie-in-the-sky""... we'll get rich together... fraudulent lie... was almost never paid... but kept on working around the clock. In fact the reader will be flabbergasted by two things... the sociopathic... demented... psychotic... Dykstra... and how in the holy hell could the author keep working for him?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241P94N7LUEAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762447990#wasThisHelpful","R241P94N7LUEAD","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Bob Dotson has spent over four decades telling his stories of Americana on the ""Today Show""... and he has many awards and fame for his endeavors. I have never seen his TV show... but I'm so very thankful I read this book. To describe this book to a potential reader is simple in one respect... and agonizingly difficult... but yet enjoyable... in  another vein... how do you write with smoke?

If a wondrous child was blessed with the ability to transform his or her childhood dreams and fantasies of princesses and giants and rabbits that could fly... into words in the water of a pool... simply by maneuvering his little finger... the emotional effect... to an adult... would be the stories in this book.To the demographic of Americans that are old enough... or enlightened enough... to know of... and treasure... the paintings of the American legend... and gift...

I offer a simple yet powerful description... as follows: the words and stories in this book... are what the world would have had... if the good Lord never gave a paint brush to Norman Rockwell... and only blessed him with a pen!I do not need to give you intricate detail of any of the heart-tugging stories that range from tiny settlements in remote Alaska... to tiny islands in the Atlantic... and everything in between... and from soldiers in many wars that didn't make it home... to soldiers that did.

These stories will give you hope... and as ugly as this world has seem to become... and man's inhumanity to man... may have rightfully made you cynical... at least I'm honest enough to admit it has to me... these stories will at times... at least for a precious moment... make you stop... and say... perhaps I can try a little harder to bring a moment of peace... or happiness... or just show some understanding... and give an absolute heartfelt shoulder of empathy and support to another person... when it is least expected.And you will cry... and you will feel proud of your fellow Americans... and it will change your worldview if only momentarily... and there will be tears.There are great achievements despite pain... there are great achievements despite loss... there are great achievements... despite awful abusive childhoods... and almost all the achievements... are for the betterment of others... and there will be tears.After reading this book you will feel like you've ""read"" and ""felt"" over two-hundred pages of Norman Rockwell paintings.I'm sure you've heard many books described as being a good book to give as a gift... well this book will make a great gift to yourself!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Y3NH8PK3IG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026050#wasThisHelpful","R8Y3NH8PK3IG1","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I had never heard of Roger Ailes until I read the short release blurb that accompanied the announcement that this book was coming out.  This book is the  fascinating and fast-moving life story of the creator of  the Rupert Murdoch financed Fox News Channel, Roger Ailes. There are constant behind the scene looks at almost every big name news personality... not only on Fox... but CNN... NBC... MSNBC... and others. Roger's comments and quips to the author are delivered with no holds barred... and what makes it even more interesting is the fact that **ROGER AILES COOPERATED WITH THE AUTHOR... BUT THE BOOK IS NOT AUTHORIZED.** At the time this book was being written, Fox News ""was already on its tenth straight year as number one and (he) was well on its way to an eleventh.""Ailes prides himself on the ""street-level"" background that he came from in Warren, Ohio... and at times... possibly ""enhances"" his image of a free-wheeling... swing from the hip... devil-may-care persona. Ailes, despite being a hemophiliac tried football in his youth and dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot. When Ailes was a child he bit his tongue and almost died. His Dad's ""co-workers from Packard came to the clinic to donate blood."" ""Always remember, Bob Ailes told his son, you've got blue collar in your veins."" Roger has never forgotten it... and quotes it whenever the right situation arises.The reader will learn first-hand about the freedom Ailes allows his on air employees. Everyone from Bill O'Reilly to Sean Hannity to Brit Hume... to everyone above... beyond... or in between. (Also find out which two big name Fox personalities don't even talk to each other despite the fact that their offices are on the same floor a hundred feet apart!)  Literally every person mentioned includes at least a smidgen or more of interesting personal tidbits that will keep you turning every page. Even one of the few ultra-liberals... Bob Beckel. And in the short page time given to Beckel you'll learn of his cocaine and alcohol problems... his messy and embarrassing involvement in the ""sting"" of a hooker... and even his punching someone out in a bar. The ""coincidental"" accumulation of attractive blonde reporters... background on Geraldo Rivera... and on and on... with a seemingly endless list of names that you and I hear every day.  And there is one common thread that weaves them altogether... in addition to the word Fox... and that's ***LOYALTY***... and that' s one thing you will know within a shadow of a doubt when you're done reading this book... ***LOYALTY***... is the most important trait a person must possess in order to have  an enduring business or personal relationship with Roger Ailes.If all of that isn't enough to cast a hypnotic spell on potential readers... there's also a first-hand account of a secretive mano-a-mano meeting between Roger and President Obama.One personal note on my experience with the author Zev Chafets: I thought he did a tremendous job on his book on Rush Limbaugh... but I disagreed vehemently with a number of his views in his book on the Baseball Hall Of Fame... but I guess that's one of the main points of being a baseball fan...  the arguments.This book is a homerun and you won't want to stop reading till you circle all the bases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9PL8WESXXCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595230955#wasThisHelpful","R1I9PL8WESXXCH","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a two story house with a skylight and window on one side of the house near the front door. I was downstairs one day when I heard annoying continuous sounds that I thought was the neighbor pounding nails. When it continued unabated I looked out the window and saw nothing. I then went outside and looked along the side of the house and half way up the very high side of my house, right where the trim divided the wall was a small bird pecking away into the wood like it was an honored guest at an unlimited 24-hour smorgasbord. It was way too high to reach and almost impossible to hit with pebbles, along with the possibility of damaging my home. I finally went into the house and filled up a large cup with water... came out and flung it as high as I could and the bird flew from the house to a tall bush near the house. I went back into the house refilled the cup and flung the water at the tranquility destroying pecker head and it then flew to a higher branch on a nearby tree. Ten minutes later the same annoying hammering sound reverberated throughout my house... the same steps mentioned above were once again repeated. A week later on a Sunday after getting a full workout the night before by my two young granddaughters, I went upstairs to take a nap. A half hour into my nap I was awoken by what I thought was someone knocking heavily AND CONTINUOUSLY on my front door (as the sound traveled differently upstairs). I decided to ignore it but some idiot just kept knocking... I was infuriated by the ill-mannered individual who wouldn't stop knocking, so I ran down the stairs flew open the door and was about to tell the aforementioned idiot where to stick his ""knocker""... when lo and behold... no one was there. I looked around the side of the house and saw my uninvited wacky-woodpecker destroying the peace along with the side of my house. I repeated the cup of water syndrome from the week before and went on Amazon to find an avenue that didn't include a .357...After reading about several products I decided on the Stream Machine Water ""Toy"". It was delivered quickly and right on time. Once I was finally able to cut the ""plastic-ties"" off the ""Toy""... which by the way are strong enough to be used as handcuffs on the world's deadliest criminals... I decided on a test combat run. On my first try I was able to run enough water into my bathroom sink near the front door... and at warp speed... due to the ""inhaling"" capability of the Stream Machine that could probably suck chrome off a trailer hitch.... I then ran out the door at full woodpecker alert speed and easily drenched the target area from my front steps... all in 45-60 seconds. I ran the red alert test again immediately to see if the original overall timing was accurate and it was. Additionally when I was done with my two tests there was a small amount of water left in the sink so I decided to test the advertised capabilities to use this ***WOODPECKER- DEFENSE -SYSTEM***... oops... I mean ""toy""... to bail the rest of the water out of the sink and it worked like a charm.I also decided to do a quick distance check in case the commie woodpecker ever tried to bring additional infantrymen on a future attack once he realized this Grandpa is now packing.

"The author John Sexton is not only the president of New York University (NYU), but he also still teaches a full schedule which is almost unheard of. ""More"" importantly... he has an absolute lifelong love affair with baseball... as many of us do. Like the author, I was a kid in New York who grew up loving the Brooklyn Dodgers... though for both of us ""loving"" would not be a strong enough description.  After a forward by another Brooklyn Dodger loving child from that exact time frame, Doris Kearns Goodwin, sets the stage for the premise of this book... the reader is transported back in time to the most beautiful... magical... exalted day... in the history of the Brooklyn Dodgers... October 4, 1955... the day in infamy when it was no longer ""WAIT-TILL-NEXT-YEAR"" for Brooklyn's beloved ""Bums"" and their fans. The author shares a personal, humorous story of how he and his friend ""Dougie"" ""knelt and prayed with all the intensity we could muster, grasping between us in dynamic tension each end of a twelve-inch crucifix we had removed from the wall."" When young Johnny Podres got the last Yankee batter out and the unattainable ""NEXT-YEAR"" was the here and now... Dougie let go of the crucifix to throw his arms up in victory... ""the laws of physics drove the head of Christ into the author's mouth chipping his front tooth""...And thus starts the author's literary quest to link in every way imaginable... baseball and religion. Though the baseball stories throughout time... are lovingly shared by the author... and any old-time fan like me... will applaud the telling...but a believable broad brush bridge between the two is never effectively made in this reader's opinion.Baseball miracles that range everywhere from  the  1914 ""miracle"" Braves... to Willie Mays' miracle catch in the 1954 World Series... to Bill Mazeroski's walk-off 1960 World Series clinching homerun... to myriad other baseball ""miracles"" before during and after... and then the author tries to link them to the same platform as religious miracles... just doesn't hold credence. Additionally the author uses fictional writings and movies as ""proof"" such as the all-time classic movie ""Field Of Dreams""... which is as much poetry as it is film. If you're really, sincerely, trying to prove something as important and spiritual as religion... I don't see the impact to the average reader in using fiction to cement a point.One humorous sub-topic of religion that the author links... and it is quite amusing is *conversion*. On the baseball side I was raised in a family that loved the Dodgers like they were an actual part of our family... and you would rather go to your grave than ever root for the Giants or Yankees. The author felt the same way until after the Dodgers (and the Giants) left New York for California... then the author says he had to make a decision for the benefit of his son... so they could share the love and fraternity of a team together. So the author ""converted"" to being a Yankee fan for the sake of his son. (Note: four generations of my family would turn over in their graves... and the two most recent generations are still alive) What's hilarious... to the gentile author... as well as the reader... is that his baptized son converted to Judaism and was Bar Mitzvahed, ""he is Jewish today, the faith of my wife, our daughter, our daughter-in-law, and our three granddaughters.""Despite my ""belief"" that the goal stated in the title wasn't met... I still want to recommend this book highly to anyone that loves the game AND the history of baseball. The author lovingly and with the wide sweeping literary flair that you'd expect from the learned president of such a prestigious university as NYU will definitely entertain you.One final note: I would venture to bet that there has never been a book written in history that uses the word *ineffable* more than this book. I am not joking. In fact this book uses *ineffable* so many times... that this book is probably also the book with the second most uses of this word.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHMQY01X0UHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592407544#wasThisHelpful","R2GHMQY01X0UHZ","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the autobiography of Mike Piazza former 12-time Major League Baseball All Star who currently holds the all-time record for most homeruns hit by a catcher in a career (396). The first thing worth pointing out to potential readers is that this book is not a typical run-of-the-mill baseball biography with big printed letters with wide spaces between the sentences and large blank margins to increase the number of pages in a book without increasing the intellectual content. The 347 pages of the story are easily equal to probably 425 or more pages in most books of this type. The writing style comes across as if Mike is talking directly to you with no phony re-interpretation of his thoughts and feelings to make his personal experiences come across more digestible for the everyday fan. In this vein... it is first a little surprising... and I mean pleasantly surprising... that when he discusses his childhood he does not camouflage his childlike exuberance for anything, whether it's his favorite snacks... favorite music... or his love of baseball... and his family.His Father, Vince played an unbelievable roll in Mike's love for and growth within the magical world that is baseball. And here's where even an old-school-baseball-fanatic like myself... learned more about Mike's Dad than I had learned over all the years that Mike has been in the countries spotlight. Being that I was a Mike Piazza fan from the time he was a rookie on the Dodgers... I of course knew that his Dad (Vince) was old friends with Dodger manager and Hall Of Famer, Tommy Lasorda... and that if it wasn't for Tommy, Mike would not have even been drafted in 1988. It's part of the legend that Tommy pushed through a complimentary throw away 62nd round pick on Piazza. But the media has also always simply described Vince Piazza as a rich multi-millionaire car dealer and so you were left with the feeling that Mike was just a poor-little-rich-kid. This book lets you know that Vince earned it all on his own and came from anything but a cushy background. I already knew about the endless hours Mike spent in the homemade batting cage in the backyard. But to hear the hour after hour... day after day... year after year... commitment... made me feel even better about Piazza's success. One of the truly mystical... almost fairy tale... stories... is the one about teenage Mike and his Dad meeting the legendary Ted Williams at an autograph show... and when the ""Splendid Splinter"" heard about the batting cage he said: ""LET'S GO SEE HIM HIT!"" And believe it or not... the next morning Ted showed up!As Mike grows up and takes you along the bumps... hills... and valleys... of his career... it is also enjoyable that the author isn't afraid to drop the childlike exuberance mentioned earlier... and talk with no filters exactly like men talk in clubhouses... bars... and the streets. You'll get a bird's eye view of everything from the time was he was fourteen and entered the Shea Stadium clubhouse and the players were watching porn... to feeling  the emotions that beat in a young Piazza's heart when he sees and discusses his childhood idol Phillies Hall Of Famer Mike Schmidt.This is a fully fleshed out life story that doesn't seem to miss a thing. From a shy boy who didn't even date in high school... to losing his virginity... to the infamous gay and steroid rumors. There are even unvarnished comments that might have come from a baseball version of an Oliver Stone conspiracy theory in areas ranging from his last days as a Dodger with accusations made about the legendary Vince Scully... to his final days as an Oakland A. And of course there's all the ugliness regarding Roger Clemens.This is a tremendously in depth look at a legendary ballplayer... who like many players during this seriously tainted era... is still awaiting... the final words... of what... and how... his accomplishments... finally... and forever... will be carved into the stones of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TFBK19152I0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439150222#wasThisHelpful","R2TFBK19152I0L","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lawrence Block the highly acclaimed and decorated mystery writer with over fifty books to his credit is back with his fifth installment of everybody's favorite stamp-collecting-hit-man ""Keller"".  Keller has been living a new quiet life with a loving wife and child under the name Nicholas Edwards in New Orleans where he renovates houses... and until recently business has been brisk in post-Katrina N'awlins. As coincidence would have it for joyous Keller-Block fans... a phone call out of the blue from former hit-person-entrepreneur... i.e. middle-(wo) man... who according to the rest of the world is dead... your friend and mine ""Dot""... gets the old killing machine team back in full gear... and leads to multiple road trips for Nicholas Edwards-Keller-and his endless bag of names and I.D.'s.Dot and Keller take up where they left off... entertaining countless readers with their almost ""Abbott and Costello"" like ""who's on first"" phone conversations. The puns fly almost as fast as do the ""burner"" cell phones that Nicholas/Keller continually gets rid of. It seems killing is the least of Keller's daily on-the-road decisions... how long to keep a phone... and whether or  not to invest a princely sum for breakfast while traveling seems to weigh much harder on our favorite philatelic  ""button-man"". The author's breezy character analysis and snappy repartee make the pages fly by and Block fans are reminded once again why their excitement level rises the minute they catch wind of a pending book release.The far ranging scope of the ""hits""... take the reader behind the scenes to such diverse locations as a monastery in Keller's old beloved hometown of New York... to a West Indies cruise... and places in between... and with ""our"" old lovable pals Dot and Keller always nearby... the entire literary trip is delightful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ERJ7F2B0L8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316127353#wasThisHelpful","R30ERJ7F2B0L8K","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would first like to state that I am an Honorably Discharged Vietnam Veteran... and secondly... I'd like to state for the record that I have read the entire book before writing this review.To give a little chronology leading up to this review... I must admit it was very hard to force myself to finish this book before I shared my feelings and views with the world. I immediately ordered this book when I saw the title and also must admit I didn't look into it enough before I purchased it. As I've read and reviewed over five-hundred-books in the last few years... the title of this book alone caused me to short cut my usual pre-purchase due diligence. As I started to read it... I was shocked and maddened by the absurdly one-sided and gruesomely biased viewpoint and story line of the author. But... I continued to read every page with an open mind... and fought off the knee-jerk-gut-wrenching-urge... to immediately write a scathing review. Why??? Because I didn't want to be a low... lack of integrity... individual who wrote views without absorbing the intelligence needed to *PRESENT-BOTH-SIDES**!!And herein lies the problem that I have with this book and this author.  I will openly state that most of what the author states is... and most likely is... true. Unfortunately war is an ugly thing. Far greater men than me have stated that ""War Is Hell!""... And believe me it is. People throughout the history of the world regardless of what country or religion they represented... have committed unthinkable crimes against humanity. In fact I would challenge the author to research all the crimes and all the wars of any decent duration... and not be able to come up with atrocities that meet or exceed Vietnam... in World War I... World War II... Korea... and all the wars America wasn't even involved in... or does the author believe that napalm was invented and first used in Nam. Regardless... lack of human behavior by humans in war have always existed and will continue... not because it's right... but because it's war. But the despicable fact of the purposeful... biased... prejudicial... reporting of this author is an insult and absolute affront to all the Honorable Americans that served. And though over 2,700,000 Americans served in Nam... the percentage of Honorable Men that served compared to the criminal element that the literary judge-jury-and-executioner... i.e. the author... specializing in ""yellow journalism""... talks about on 99.99 Per Cent of the pages is so overwhelming it's ridiculous...Yet the author (and I'm rounding off here... even though I read the entire book) talks of over 3 million sorties... millions of tons of bombs... millions of rounds of ammunition... untold rapes... untold tortures... regarding being dropped... shot... and perpetrated on the Vietnamese... yet... and this is what really peeves me to no end... the author would lead you to believe that there may have been ten bullets total shot against Americans during the entire Vietnam War... that Americans were never tortured... that maybe two bombs were dropped on us... that the VC never booby trapped their own children (believe me they did)... he makes a mockery of the fact that after eighteen-nineteen-twenty-year-old-American kids had land mines go off... had their buddy next to them killed by an enemy that all looked alike and mostly didn't wear uniforms... that YES!... wearing ""black pajamas"" did blur who the enemy was. NOTE: Please check your daily news for the problems in our... and the world's current wars and the problems created by everybody's enemies not wearing uniforms...But no! The author only babbles and rambles on about America's bad apples... that were a microscopic percentage of Americans involved in this awful war. In fact... right from the get-go the author spews negative statements about 18-19-20-year-old kids like me who in basic training were taught chants such as ""KILL-KILL-KILL"" during the short training getting us kids who weren't old enough to legally drink ready for war. I ask this yellow-journalist if he understands that our country was getting us ready to either live or die and our readiness would not only affect our ability to continue to breathe... but it would affect all the other Americans with us? The author sitting behind the safety of his keyboard rather than being on the frontlines where you're afraid to even close your eyes to sleep in fear that you'll never wake up... acts like we should have been trained for a picnic with Grandma and should have been chanting ""LOVE-YOUR-APPLE-PIE-GRANDMA"".There's much more I can say regarding this ""tar-and-feather-railroading-job-point-of-view"" put forward by this less than admirable author... but I'll close with this thought. Yes... there were obviously bad, horrendous things done during the Vietnam War... as in every major war... but please do the decent admirable thing... and as you're reporting the sad facts of the utter minority... make at least a paltry effort of something at least coming close to equal time... for the **HONORABLE-AMERICAN-MAJORITY** that you're staining with the vile residue of your biased-prejudicial-paint-brush. You should be ashamed of what you have attempted to portray the majority with as a by-product of only describing the minority.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78DDU6T9SUQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805086919#wasThisHelpful","R78DDU6T9SUQR","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For existing Robert Crais fans they should know this is not another Elvis Cole and Pike installment... though it does take place in the same familiar terrain... Studio City, North Hollywood, Glendale and Los Angeles. This is a total standalone novel told in a wonderfully unique fashion. The main characters are Maggie a beautiful German shepherd... Marine Veteran (that's right... that's not a misprint) who in her last tour of duty in Afghanistan as an explosive sniffer not only lost her human partner (her ""pack"") but was also wounded herself by a sniper. In an extremely touching scene her love and loyalty to her handler dictated that she refused to leave his body even after being shot herself. Meanwhile back in the states the second lead character, Los Angeles cop Scott James is seriously wounded during an unexplainable multiple murder situation that included the killing of his female partner.These two totally separate events... transpiring half-way around the world from each other... result in two badly damaged individuals... Scott the cop... and Maggie the dog... and coincidentally... both of them are damaged physically... and psychologically. Both are grudgingly given a second chance as they are allowed to attempt to become a team... a ""pack"" for the LAPD. They both need to hide physical limps... and learn to overcome their psychological problems... yes... Maggie had psychological problems also. Among other things... they both jumped and flinched at the sound of a gunshot or loud noises.I must state for the record that even though I am now a Grandfather... I have never had a pet... but after reading this story and the way the author described the melding of the damaged cop... and the damaged Marine dog... made me see the beauty and love that is possible between human and canine in a whole new heartwarming light. Seeing through the eyes of Maggie as well as Scott's... as they feel each other out... as they build an unfettered love and trust for each other stirred wonderful emotions within me... and I'm sure it will do the same for many other readers.Though Crais fan's old favorites Cole and Pike are absent... you will still have the enjoyment of the author's unique ""crime-scene-poetry"" that only he can create... such as: ""then bullets ripped into their patrol car and the Bentley with the thunder of steel rain""... ""the AK-47 bloomed with yellow flowers""... and... ""he recalled the spent casings twinkling like a brass rainbow as they arced from the big man's rifle.""After reading this book there are two things I can't wait for... the next Robert Crais Cole-Pike book... and I can't wait to go over my son's house this weekend and pet his dog more enthusiastically... and talk to her more when I take her for a walk... just like I learned in ""Suspect""!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M7XGQAJNTUS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399161481#wasThisHelpful","R3M7XGQAJNTUS9","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1992 nine-year-old-about-to- be-ten Katie Beers... already an abused and ill-treated young girl was kidnapped in Long Island, New York. For seventeen days this poor, innocent, girl... who had already had stolen from her... any semblance of a childhood that so many of us take for granted... and poets write about... and was then physically forced into an X-rated... human debauchery... version of an Alice In Wonderland... trip down a rabbit hole... that landed this poor darling into a living hell conducted by the lowest scum of sub-human excrement. John Esposito... and believe me it makes me violently ill and have murderous thoughts regarding this deviant pervert... just by writing his name... as I'm sure many other readers will... when you read Katie's story.This soulless bag of skin (if I could use the same amount of letters a different way and still get this review published, believe me I would!) actually constructed an underground bunker that went down under a secretly activated shelf in a book case... down under the house and driveway with a tiny coffin like cage that he locked and chained poor Katie in.  *FOR-SEVENTEEN-DAYS* she was not only sexually abused over and over... but how she survived mentally and emotionally with no outside light and barely the ability to move around... only G-d can answer.As Katie so eloquently stated when her situation all sunk in that first day: ""WITH NO WINDOWS, NO LIGHT, NO MEALS, NO HOPE, IT WAS ONE ENDLESS SICKENING DAY.""Even before Katie was abducted she had been molested by her Godmother's husband... she was forced into doing all types of labor around the house and at the Laundromat... becoming what amounted to a child slave. During the investigation while Katie was missing, the co-author interviewed local shop owners who would comment in dismay how when Katie was three or four years old in frigid weather she would come in all alone... barefooted... and totally unkempt.This gut-and-soul-wrenching story is told through two voices... Katie's and co-author Carolyn Gusoff... who was one of many reporters on the case as it evolved. Not to take any credit away from Carolyn... but when Katie speaks of her ordeal... her very life... your world will stop... you will feel many emotions from sadness... to empathy... to anger... to vile nausea. Is the writing good? To answer that I have to try to share an analogy with you... and there really is no true analogy for something this dire... but... I've thought of this over and over during the emotions of reading this book. If you're a sports fan... regardless of the sport... if after watching a game you never even noticed or paid attention to the umpires, referees, etc. ... then the umps and ref's did a great job. Believe me... you will not even consider the writing when Katie is ""speaking""... your emotions take over as a human being and you're feeling... and feeling for... Katie. And every opposite emotion will be pulsating through your body regarding the sick below human deviants that caused the pain, suffering and humiliation in Katie's life.The utterly redeeming part of this story is that Katie somehow... by the Grace-Of-G-d... salvaged her life and has graduated college... got married... has two children... and unbelievably has said her being kidnapped might have been the best thing that ever happened to her because it gave her a chance to get away from the awful childhood situation she was born into.Last night... 2/16/13... right after I finished this book I happened to be watching Fox News... and lo and behold... Katie was a guest on the show... this book is the first time she's discussed her life and experience ever in the twenty years that have passed. She is a wonderful looking young woman... she has an angel's personality... is sooo well spoken... this can only be proof that miracles can happen. I am so happy for her and her **NEW** family that I can't even put it in words. G-d Bless you Katie... and I can't write here what I hope happens... and would personally volunteer to do... to that deviant, miscreant, perverted, Esposito.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R448IW6XNSU16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985247843#wasThisHelpful","R448IW6XNSU16","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A large part of my personal library is made up of a crime section that engulfs everything from criminal psychology to serial killer profiling to the FBI to the Mafia and everything in between. So in reviewing this book a number of things must be analyzed that involves comparisons to other books of this genre. By now it is absolutely old-hat how one after another... after another... of these former mobsters who bragged about *OMERTA**... the vaunted *CODE-OF-SILENCE* not only rat out their ""brothers""... but then have the unmitigated gall to brag about it in books they write. So accepting the fact that to the outside world ratting out your brothers after taking a sacred oath to put *La Cosa Nostra* - *THIS-THING-OF-OURS* ahead of everything including G-d, country and family... is once again being denigrated... the shock value that used to come from such ground breaking books no longer applies.The details of the literally non-stop incestuous killings ""of their own"" in the Atlantic City and Philadelphia area is so voluminous and non-stop that it almost defies belief. The story centers around the author Philip ""Crazy Phil"" Leonetti and his uncle Nicodemo ""Little Nicky"" Scarfo... and despite Phil on one hand constantly paying ""tribute"" to Uncle Nicky for teaching him the true *La Cosa Nostra* way from childhood... early on in the book and then for all eternity he becomes sick of being around Scarfo... and is actually happier than he's ever been when his Uncle is in jail. The author also has the audacity to call his Uncle evil. Is that not the epitome of ""the pot calling the kettle black""... since Phil was involved one way or the other in every one of the murders his Uncle ordered?There are also a couple of repetitive writing nuances that become burdensome to the reader such as listing the characters entire name in innumerable paragraphs on a page interspersed with paragraphs in between them with shortened versions... like you're going to forget who Uncle Nicky or Crazy Phil is from one paragraph to the next... and believe me this idiosyncratic writing style takes place hundreds of times. Also the term ""compound"" is used to describe where they live enough times to choke a horse.Along with the dissolution of *OMERTA*, the time honored Mafia code of not involving family members who don't participate in ""THIS-THING-OF-OURS"" in brutal retaliation also goes by the wayside. Killing innocent family members along with killing targets in front of their Mothers become commonplace and is laid out in no uncertain terms by the author.As the saying goes: ""If you're keeping score at home""... it will be a close race as to which there is more of in this book... killing people who were your friends/family members/valued associates... or how many former avowed sworn to the death to observe *OMERTA* members... sang like a canary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WX8A8TLIQ1LL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762445831#wasThisHelpful","R2WX8A8TLIQ1LL","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an Honorably Discharged Vietnam Era Veteran let me make one main point before I get into the detail of this book:  ** IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES MILITARY VETERAN **  ** YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK **  ** FOR MANY REASONS **  ** SOME OF WHICH WILL ONLY BE KNOWN BY YOU!! **When you enter the United States Military... in most cases as a teenager or a young adult... except during the war years where you may have been drafted at a more advanced age... you are promised by your brand new D.I. ... T.I. ... or whatever name they've assigned to your branch of the service for the mostly malicious... egomaniacal... slave driving... short on brains... dripping in prejudice... supposedly having your best interests in mind... etc. ... etc. ... person who's going to eventually save your life and the life of your platoon/flight/etc. teammates life... that this time in basic training will become the experience that you will look back on with the greatest joy and admiration of anything you've participated in during your entire life.This is of course absolute B.S.! Just off the top of my head... the birth of my children and grandchildren were way higher on the lifetime enjoyment scale among many others.And it so happened that my D.I. was the most anti-Semitic individual I ever met before my enlistment in 1968 and for the forty-four years since then. In fact he would have been a perfect wing man for Hitler... except for the fact that I don't think Hitler ever had minorities in executive positions.But putting that aside... this book is so spot on in it's descriptions and examples of every single part of basic training that I don't think there's an American Veteran alive who won't get some joy out of this book... as over and over... in countless and innumerable situations... us veterans will say to ourselves: ""Wow... so it wasn't just me!"" And despite what your lying D.I./T.I. told you... you won't be talking about your experiences in basic training with every other person you meet for the rest of your life. But reading this book makes up for it. THERE IS SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH... THIS AUTHOR!It's all there... scrubbing toilets and floors with tooth brushes... push up after push up... polishing shoes... making beds... do I need to say hospital corners that you and I continue to make for the next half a century... without even having to think how you do it or how you learned?? Learning how to salute... and knock on the dictator's door as he bellows... ""Louder clown... I can't hear you!""... (As I punch a hole through the wall.) (Note: I just found a picture of that destroyed wall in old photo's a couple of weeks ago.)... And any true veteran will get the clammy sweats when I mention... **KP**... all covered here in detail. And how about when you're trained/tested/educated on  using a gas mask... including of course having to pull off the mask in the middle of tear gas detonation and either recite the alphabet... or in my case... recite a string of pre-memorized five digit numbers that would determine if I was the right man for a classified mission. (With snot... mucous... spit... and any other thing that can possibly ooze and gush out of your eyes... nose... and mouth... doing so... with a complete will of its own!)And of course... probably the truest part of this book and life... is the fact that your basic platoon or flight will be the greatest melting pot of diverse human beings... races... religions... smells... eating habits... acceptance of standards of life... accents... drawls... and did I say smells?... that you will ever encounter in three lifetimes.There are quotes from men and women who served from the first World War on that verifies each unique tortuous method and maneuver that us Veterans went through in basic trainings that took place anywhere from Paris Island to the Great Lakes to San Antonio to Oklahoma and everywhere in between.As I said earlier... in my life at least... I haven't found many people in the last forty-four-years to share my basic training experiences with... but this book took on a life of its own as I read it... and I told the book what I went through... because I knew it would understand... and I was just as good and a compassionate listener... as the book told me its travails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13Y05VOMOYQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312622775#wasThisHelpful","R13Y05VOMOYQD","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an Honorably Discharged Viet Nam Era Veteran... I perhaps look at a book like this differently than most average citizens. In addition to wanting to learn more about the bravest of the brave that represent and defend our country... I also delve into these books with a few decidedly personal and selfish hopes and goals. One of my hopes is that when I read and learn about one of the rarefied few who have been honored with America's Highest Military Honor **THE-MEDAL-OF-HONOR**... such as Sal Giunta... that the story is presented in the true ""voice"" and personality of what this hero is... and was really like... before and after the event that led to the honor... and the personality and characteristics' of the award winner after this cherished presentation. Since I've always prided myself in being an everyday ""street"" guy raised by a Father who from the time I could walk and talk to **never-forget-where-you-came-from""... no matter how successful you might become... I hope to find that same innate trait in any of our nation's heroes.Any potential reader who carries that same desire within them... whether they heretofore didn't realize it... or perhaps couldn't define that feeling they carried within their gut and soul up to the present... well then... this is the book for you. The author's words jump out at you... and wash over you as comfortably as if you're talking with your buddies on the street corner or walking down the halls of your high school. It brings back memories when you were in high school and you weren't interested in class but blended in and got along... but you knew you really enjoyed hitting people on the football field. You may have had trouble communicating with your parents... and another added beauty of the author is he doesn't deny it... nor does he try to use revisionist history to change the way he was.Sal so aptly describes the initial shock of the total degradation that a teenager like he and myself faced the minute we arrived in basic training. He very quickly and intelligently grasps the fact that basic training is probably the biggest melting pot there is... and all the pushups... running... etc. isn't just for physical reasons... but for mental toughness when you're in battle and complaining won't help you.On Sal's journey to **THE-MEDAL-OF-HONOR** there are numerous mistakes and pitfalls... and to Sal's credit they're not ignored. I also love the fact that Sal uses the language that young soldiers use. The type of language that  a chaplain warned me and my platoon not to use before our first trip back home... and  to make sure and not say the following at  XMAS dinner: ""Hey Mom could you pass the ***** salt!""This is truly a soldier's story from ""one of us"" out on the streets of America. It's not from a West Point or Naval Academy graduate... but an everyday young man from Iowa who after working in a Krispy Kreme and a Subway Sandwich shop... ""Signed up to fight for my country; to jump out of planes, shoot guns, and kill people. I signed up for the T-shirt. That's just the truth of it. But I got much more than I bargained for, in ways both good and bad.""He got two tattoos... and one of them he's not even sure what it is... it might have something to do with the Aztecs.""If someone asks what it means, I tell them this:""""IT MEANS I WAS SEVENTEEN AND STUPID.""Sal... I got one when I was nineteen and stupid!Welcome home ""Brother""... you represent us well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18W4C4EX9JX4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451691467#wasThisHelpful","R18W4C4EX9JX4P","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*SPOILER-ALERT*-- Really, only a spoiler alert for my thirty-two year-old son. I hope you have no time to check out this review just like my other reviews due to your busy schedule, because this is a  XMAS gift for you.If you yourself enjoy seeing, reading, studying jet aircraft, or have a loved one that does... this is the book for you. I'm an honorably discharged Viet Nam Era Veteran and when I served I was on the ground and the jets were overhead. My full grown son has an Uncle who flew during Viet Nam and that among other reasons is why he has always had a fascination with jets.I researched a number of books dedicated to jets and this one looked like the best bet... and I was on pins and needles awaiting its delivery... hoping it was as good as it sounded. Wow! What a beautifully put together treasure. This should be quite a conversation piece for years to come as a coffee-table-book proudly displayed. The quality of the construction is superb. It is approximately 12 "" X 9 ¼"" and almost 1 ½"" thick. (And it weighs close to FIVE POUNDS.) It has a beautiful colorful book jacket and each individual page is thick and glossy. The pictures are exquisite and the  drawings  are akin to an architect's blueprint and  are eye-catching.The jets are listed chronologically from 1942 to the present. Even a novice such as myself will get caught up in the excitement just by randomly looking through the pages and stopping and checking key statistics that range from dimensions to weights to fuel to  PERFORMANCE (THAT'S SPEED BABY!) and armament.  When you see speeds listed past 1,000 MPH it's hard not to sigh and want to discuss it with someone. From beautiful external pictures of these man-made-lethal beasts to pictures of innumerable cockpits that epitomizes the  evolution of the actual ""guts"" of these soaring testimonials to military precision.This highly-highly recommended book embodies the adage of  ""it is better to give than receive""... as I can't wait to see my son's reaction when he opens this gift! I will share the experience with you in a month or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KK5LF6QOJ0MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607101084#wasThisHelpful","R1KK5LF6QOJ0MH","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though not quite as hilariously and continually funny as ""The Bible of Unspeakable Truths""... perhaps because in this election year (that was)  the subject is unfortunately more grievously serious... and because it's sad and scary what the right side of the street has to put up with. Greg pulls no punches and though he parenthetically includes his one-of-a-kind biting and intermittently self-deprecating humor...  it's hard for the author or the reader to laugh off what American politics and the pseudo-tolerating princes and  princesses  of phony climate-change-racism-(if you disagree with anything the President says or does)-sexual-bias-... you name it- on and on... including but not limited to false apologies by entertainers when caught making asinine comments relating to conservatives.Because of the undeniable seriousness (you can't get much more serious than ""mass"" life or death) of many of the subjects... the author makes a strong point and just out of sheer decency has to back off from adding even greater discussion of the absolute mockery of these princes/princesses views... along with the nauseating current political views from the top. Case in point: The Fort Hood Massacre... when the current political regime termed that terrorist abomination ""WORKPLACE VIOLENCE""... the author's retort: ""CALLING THE FORT HOOD MASSACRE WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IS LIKE CALLING PEAR HARBOR AN AIR SHOW."" Obviously much more could and should be said... but the author showed conscientious restraint.Describing a protestor saying money is bad, Greg delicately and hilariously  replies: ""Is making money bad? Would the world be a better place without money, as the young lass hoped (she was so cute--like a puppy explaining brain surgery).""And as far as certain socialist leanings... ""No one cares about things they don't own. To quote the great Milton Friedman"", ""when everybody owns something, nobody owns it, and nobody has a direct interest in maintaining or improving its condition.""Certain types of people won't like this book... but hopefully many more will... and the ones that have and will enjoy it... remember... ""We're using a secret password: Morey Amsterdam."" (""Don't ask me why... and if you ask anyone else about this they'll just deny everything.

"""Jewish Jocks"" is the perfect formula for all that is special in modern Jewish literature... history past and present... more sorrow than any one people deserve to be burdened with... denigration that many don't... won't... and shouldn't put up with... writing that  from paragraph to paragraph can range from poetic... to humorous... to agonizingly emotional if you are a true member of the tribe... role models in areas you may not have thought to look for them in... and the beautiful sense of family and pride over the centuries... and yes... more and more Jewish idols and role models in sports!The very short stories that range from Sid Luckman to Sandy Koufax... and from Mose Soloman (whose signing by John McGraw and the Giants led to the following headline in the Sporting News: ""McGRAW PAYS 50K FOR ONLY JEWISH BALLPLAYER IN CAPTIVITY."") to boxing champion Barney Ross whose story written by Buzz Bissinger is probably the most  powerful six page story you'll read in many a year!The multiplicity of authors with subjects ranging from boxers from over 250 years ago to ping pong players to a basketball coach named Auerbach who never paid ""retail"" for the stars he acquired through trades, in what history has proven to be almost always one-sided in *THE-RED*... also include members of the tribe of Israel that are infamous as well. Including Arnold Rothstein who was part of the throwing of the 1919 World Series as well as Jack Molinas who helped throw basketball games from all sides of the court. What makes each short story provide a larger impact to the reader than the mere total of the pages... is that you can feel the personal heartfelt feelings in almost every writer's story.In my opinion this  book is not unlike a top athlete who can hit, field, run, throw and hit with power. This book can make you laugh... and make you want to cry. You are reminded of the Holocaust... and really what human being should ever forget that... with facts such as: ""Three quarters of Dutch Jewry was murdered in the Holocaust, a higher proportion than anywhere else  in western Europe""... it motivates you when the great Hank Greenberg said about all the anti-Semitic attacks: ""IT DROVE ME TO DO BETTER, TO PROVE THAT A JEW COULD BE A BALLPLAYER."" And the humor... ""G-d made the Gentiles because someone had to buy retail.""There are so many great stories in this one book... and I'd be amiss to not make note of  the one on  the great prideful Al Rosen who fought back on and off the baseball field against the despicable anti-Semitism he faced and it ""only intensified Rosen's Jewish identity.""There's a lot to be learned for both Jews and Gentiles in this book... from the fact ""Between the two world wars, there were twenty-six Jewish boxing champions, including two of the greatest fighters of the era, Benny Leonard and Barney Ross""... to the tough as nails Jewish quarterback who changed the game by the name of Sid Luckman... ""Sid (changing yet another stereotype) is remembered less for his brain than for his brawn. It was impossible to keep Sid Luckman out of a crucial contest. Like Moshe Dayan or Bugsy Siegel, he was the big Yid who tells the world,  ""YOU THINK YOU KNOW  US,  BUT YOU'RE WRONG.""P.S. And a little humor for the road: ""Arnold Rothstein is the price we pay for Albert Einstein.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GR1OY1AKGWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455516139#wasThisHelpful","R35GR1OY1AKGWP","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As always... I write my reviews in such a way as to present to a potential purchaser the type of information and feelings that I myself would hope to get reading someone else's review before I purchased a  book. So the first thing I will take my own literary license with is that I consider this ""book"" to be more of an encyclopedia than what most everyday people would consider a ""book"". This encyclopedia of the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers which of course was the year and team that Jackie Robinson broke the modern color line in Major League Baseball with, and the title of the book is one-thousand-percent correct when it says the Brooklyn Dodgers... *FOREVER CHANGED BASEBALL AND AMERICA!*As a born and raised Brooklyn Dodger fan... with parents that made the lovable ""Bums"" part of my everyday life... and whom to this day I say that my Mother (let alone my Father) knew more about the Dodgers and baseball than anyone else in my neighborhood. I bought this book about seven months ago and never finished it completely till now.  During this period I did read and complete about twenty other books. Why you may ask? Aaah... well here's why I addressed the problem of describing this as more of an encyclopedia than a book. First of all for an old-time-old-school... not only Brooklyn Dodger... but an any team old-school-baseball fanatic... as interesting as each short biographical story was on each player... each player's story ended much like an extra-large baseball card might end. In other words... it ended... and then another player with no continuing story or saga tied to the end of the prior player began. So in essence that's why I have gone to the detail I have to give it a separate rating as a book AND as an encyclopedia. And I feel I'm not alone in stating that a normal person wouldn't sit down and start reading an encyclopedia from start to finish. So I read other books during the time period I read more and more of this encyclopedia.If that's understood... let me now tell you about this encyclopedia of the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers. The author's should be highly complimented on their research. The detail from birth to death (if now deceased) is amazing! The author's include every single Dodger that even played one game during this historical season. It also is very sad in a way... because as you get to know even the mostly unknown members of this team... due to 1947 being so long ago... most of the player's story end with their death. So just after getting to know them intimately... you literally have to say goodbye to them... as the old saying goes ""We hardly knew ye"".There are also  almost daily update summary pages of the season... and detailed reporting on the 1947 World Series... reviews of all the major awards for the season including MVP... Rookie Of The Year... Top Pitcher... stories on the Dodger broadcasters, advertisers and owners.The quotes regarding some of the greats... not so greats... and hanger-on's... are priceless. There are so many... so it's hard to pick one or two to tempt a potential reader... but two that I'd love to share with you are regarding ""Pistol Pete"" Reiser... who might have been the greatest player to ever grace a ball field. Unfortunately **PISTOL-PETE-NEVER-MET-A-WALL-HE-DIDN'T-LIKE!**Why would I say he may have been the greatest player who ever played? ""Before his multitude of injuries, ""teammate (and future Hall Of Famer) Billy Herman-who had played with hall Of Famers Chuck Klein and Hack Wilson-said Pete Reiser was the greatest player he had ever seen on a baseball field.""  If that isn't enough for you... how about Hall Of Fame Manager Leo Durocher who also managed a pretty good ballplayer by the name of Willie Mays who said: ""Pete Reiser might have been the best ballplayer I ever saw."" In addition to Reiser once having last rites performed on him while he lay on the field. Here is a quote from this encyclopedia about Reiser's injuries in his career:""THERE IS NO OFFICIAL COUNT OF Reiser's baseball injuries, but the best guess reads something like a dozen collisions with unpadded fences, five skull fractures (though he claimed only four), a chronically dislocated shoulder, two broken ankles, damaged knee cartilage, torn muscles in his left leg, and two beaning's in the days before batting helmets. As a player HE WAS CARRIED OFF THE FIELD ON A STRETCHER ELEVEN TIMES-SIX TIMES CONSCIOUS, FIVE TIMES NOT.""This is the type of priceless anecdotes that pepper this wonderful encyclopedia. If you get it... take your time and enjoy it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARJBBZ31A73T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803239920#wasThisHelpful","RARJBBZ31A73T","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a brain tumor survivor who almost died during brain surgery 9 ½ years ago and feel blessed with every day I've been given. I had nowhere near the experience that the author Dr. Alexander did, but have had an experience or two that if discussed openly... being that I'm just an ordinary everyday layman... without the impressive resume' of the author which includes:"" graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a major in chemistry and earning an M.D. at Duke University Medical School, had eleven years of medical school and residency training at Duke as well as Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard, completed a fellowship in cerebrovascular neurosurgery in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom, spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School , as an associate professor of surgery, with a specialization in neurosurgery""... if I had shared with the world my spiritual experiences I would most likely have been lambasted. That is why I am so happy that Dr. Alexander wrote this book and shared his experiences.Though  it's a short book with a limited description of the beauty of a heavenly experience... I'm sure no matter how much of this experience was shared it would seem too short. If more people were given an even playing field of credence in sharing their Near-Death-Experiences (NDE) then it wouldn't matter that people such as myself are mere laymen.The author's story describes in depth his sudden onset of meningitis and E. coli which led to his brain shutting down and being in a coma for seven days. A very touching part of the story is Eben's experience as an adopted child and the intermingling throughout the story of his extremely emotional attempts to be reunited with his birth family. Perhaps the most honest hard-hitting points made in the book are the times Dr. Alexander admits that prior to his NDE experience he would have been at the front of the line of the naysayers who ""HAVE INSISTED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITY CANNOT COEXIST."" In fact at the end of the book in Appendix B entitled ""Neuroscientific Hypotheses I Considered to Explain My Experience""... he states: ""In reviewing my recollections with several other neurosurgeons and scientists, I entertained several hypotheses that might explain my memories. Cutting right to the chase, they all failed to explain the rich, robust, intricate interactivity of the Gateway and Core experiences (the ""ultra-reality""). And then lists them all thereby debunking what would have been the standard lines of denunciation.This book gives hope and faith to all the people who believe... and want to believe... whether everyday laymen... or highly educated scientific and medical individuals.P.S. Included in this book is perhaps the most beautiful poem about dying that I have ever read entitled: ""WHEN TOMORROW STARTS WITHOUT ME."" By David M.

"The dichotomy in writing a review of this book is due to the dependency on what type of book on this subject the potential reader is truly looking for... and depending on the pre-purchase desire of you... the potential purchaser... you're going to wind up on one end of the spectrum or the other. Either very satisfied... or very disappointed. (Or in my case... generally satisfied... but disappointed in the lack of any hard hitting fully developed or discussed climactic evidence regarding whether Oswald truly did it... did it by himself... did it knowingly with others... was a pitiful pawn... whether it was the Mafia... the CIA... Castro's Cuba... LBJ inspired... etc.)At this point in my review... let me make it absolutely clear that *I AM NOT ANY KIND OF CONSPIRACY ZEALOT OF ANY KIND!* I was reading this book hoping to get a stronger, more educated view of what may have really happened on the day of JFK's assassination... the days before... and the days after. Especially... regardless of how you feel about the author... he is definitely not some whacko living in his Mother's basement creating conspiracy theories that range from a Martian invasion to Tony Soprano's Father. So based on almost half-a-century of time passing... and O'Reilly's large public figure... my thought process was  that there would be a hell of a lot more behind the scenes... out of the public eye... till now... revelations. BUT THERE WEREN'T! ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISE PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THIS BOOK... unless of course... the fact that JFK always swam totally nude in the White House pool every day is your idea of who really planned... and killed... and covered up... as heretofore... never publicly ""exposed"" assassination conspiracy tidbits. As point of fact... JFK's nude swimming was mentioned just as many times as any possible mob, CIA, LBJ, Castro, etc. skullduggery.Now, with that having been said... this non-explosive book... is nonetheless an easy well-paced trip down memory lane... covering everything from PT-109 to Kennedy's early political career... and of course the Presidency and assassination. It covers the short-lived Camelot that Americans and the world fell in love with. It covers the hatred between Bobby Kennedy and LBJ... along with the dislike and distrust of J. Edgar Hoover. It follows on a very milquetoast basis Lee Harvey Oswald... and of course there's the (what everyone in the world knows) JFK philandering... his relationship with Frank Sinatra that was halted when Bobby as Attorney General was going after organized crime... and of course Marilyn Monroe.All of this is well written and breezy... but there are ABSOLUTELY NO HARD HITTING OR EARTH-SHAKING EXPOSE'S IN THIS BOOK!Now some people will trash this book simply because O'Reilly wrote it... I happen to like O'Reilly... but I'm very disappointed at the meekness of the non-answers (or non-detailed discussions of) to the question everyone wants to know... and many people spend a lifetime debating a half-a-century later.I give this barely a four-star-rating for the quality of the story... of JFK's life... but the negative part of my rating is for what in all intents and purposes is a total ignoring of the question I and probably many others tuned in for.Sure... I know where I was when Kennedy was killed... but after reading this book... I do not know for certain... one more thing about his assassination!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7SH6EJIVC8SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096663#wasThisHelpful","R7SH6EJIVC8SS","A1623N94C3XATU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1623N94C3XATU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Well researched with some quotes from Government officials, rare photos, and information discovered.The Authors find that underground facilities and possible cities may be more probable than most people think. From information obtained by former military and ""Whistle-blowers"" this possibility does not seem so far fetched.A very compelling story which really left me wondering.

"I was skeptical about these patches at first, but I was willing to give it a try and boy I am so glad I did. I never really thought I needed this product, but I must say I notice the difference in my skin. I have been wearing them for a few weeks now so I could really see if the product actually worked on me. I have acne prone skin and tend to have break outs in the chest area so was not sure how this product would work on my skin. Gladly, I did not break out nor did it cause irritation to my skin. After a few wears, I started to notice my skin firm up and look tighter and it made ""the girls"" look better if you know what I mean. The patches are very soft and comfortable to wear. Some days I would wear them to bed and others I would wear after showering in the morning for a hour or so. They are easy to apply and to clean off for multiple uses. I really enjoyed using these and the results are fantastic especially if you have a few wrinkles or two in that area.

The instructions are fairly easy to follow and it is not difficult to use. All you need is an outlet and a spot to place your cup on and you are on your way.

"l have been using this brush now for a few days and I can say it gets the job done. Not only does it get the tangles out, but it also makes my hair a lot easier to maintain. I have thick natural curly hair and it gets tangled all the time. Detangling can hurt and pulls out my hair strains if not done carefully. This brush is very light weight plastic so I was skeptical of if being able to tackle my kinks, but sure enough it did. It is very gentle on hair and scalp and works through strains fairly well. I was very impressed at how well it detangles my hair wet or dry. Also it doesn't pull out my hair like other brushes or combs so that is a plus in my book.

"My first time trying a steamer and this one is really neat. Once I figured out how to open the steamer, I was very impressed with the quality and the innovation. It comes in a small box and is compacted together, but once you open it up it contracts and is very flexible to fix any size pot. It is fairly easy to use and clean. I steamed broccoli the first time by  placing the broccoli on the steamer and lowering it by the center ring into a pot of boiling water and let the steam work its magic.

"Very nice tea. Definitely not the tea I am used to so I was excited to try this out. I absolutely love the tin it comes in and plan on reusing it. As for the tea, it has a wonderful smell and it taste great also. It was very light and refreshing and unlike most teas, not a lot of sugar was needed. I have never had loose tea before so brewing could be a little tricky. I used a tea infuser and that seemed to worked out great from me, but is not needed if you do not have one. The trick when making this tea is to not let the water get too hot. If the water gets too hot the tea will have a bitter taste, so don't fully boil your water or let it cool down a little if you do before steeping.

"This is my third cat tree by Iris. I have one in the living room and two in the rec room. They do a great job of creating an indoor habitat that my seven rescue cats love.This cat tree is well built, has 4 tiers with a hide-away, a swing, a hammock, scratching posts, perches and climbing steps. This tree took me about an hour to put together. The instructions are very basic, with pictures instead of instructions. I put furniture sliders on the bottom of this cat tree so I can easily move it from place to place. The cats love it.

"I haven’t had an electric blanket since the 1990’s and I really have missed it. I like to turn the thermostat down in the evening to save electricity, but I don’t like to pile covers on my bed to keep warm. I enjoy a warm bed, so I turn on the blanket about 10 minutes before I go to bed and the Serta preheat warms the bed very fast. I only use one control for my bed, but it works for me. The blanket is very soft and such a pretty color of light beige. The instructions are very easy to follow. Just hook up the blanket connection to the power cord and then to an outlet. It is probably best to work the power cord under the mattress and have the blanket connection at the end of the bed. Then have the power controller on your bedside table. The controls are simple, turn the power on and then decide which heat setting you want and how long you want the heat to stay on. Works like a charm!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UCRZPH6NCTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHH8FK#wasThisHelpful","R34UCRZPH6NCTZ","A2KMV056844YV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KMV056844YV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am writing this review after using the illuminage hair reduction system for a week. It is touted as proven to be effective in permanently reducing hair growth after just 3 months of treatment. I will finish the review in 3 months. I followed the directions and actually shaved my legs and underarms before the treatment. This is done so the system focuses on the hair follicles beneath the surface, rather than on present hair.  The treatment is very simple, you place the applicator on your skin so that the two silver contact bars are in contact with the skin. The applicator will emit abright white light as you move slowly over the skin. If there is no bright white light, the contact bars are not in contact with the skin. I admit the bright light was somewhat scary, but it does not make the skin warm, and is over in a second. Once I got use to it, I was able to glide the applicator over my legs, moving the applicator after each flash. I repeated the process two more times. Do not hold the applicator over one area of skin and flash multiple times. This may cause injury to the skin. The applicator is very safe, it will turn itself off if it is not in use for 30 seconds. You can also use the illuminate touch on your face, just follow the directions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RWZ4ERUIA4GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BVHT6O#wasThisHelpful","R1RWZ4ERUIA4GG","A2KMV056844YV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KMV056844YV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Huge Transformers Robot Bumblebee Car toy! This toy is gigantic - it measures nearly 20 inches tall! There are flashing lights and it has a total of 15 different sounds and phrases. Converts from gigantic robot into super sports car in just 3 easy steps. This is a really fun and entertaining toy. I am no expert on Transformers or plastic, for that matter, but I do know this is a fun and really cool toy. It is for ages 6 and older and I am impressed that it comes with an app that kids can download, scan the toy shield to unlock content and play fun games on any iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and some other Android devices. I think this adds a great digital bonus to the toy and will expand kids imagination. I can't compare it to previous Transformers toys because I am not familiar with them, but I do love the sheer size of this Robot/Car. It is impressive and very detailed. It will keep kids entertained since they can use it as a Robot and then transform it into the sports car and race around with it - very fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YPAZF3M5178/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZFBM#wasThisHelpful","R10YPAZF3M5178","A2KMV056844YV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KMV056844YV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is the perfect size for little hands to hold onto and each page has a different number and correlated graphic to match that number.

It is probably for parents to use at first and then as the child gets older they will be able to recognize that with their ""action"" of pushing the ball they get to hear the phrase. This helps in development of learning skills and action and reaction.

"We have been through the trials of all different kinds of food to keep our pets healthy, address urinary issues, and find something they actually like to eat!

I like the fact that the kibble pieces are small and easily digestible. And the ingredient list makes this pet mom very happy - oatmeal, barley and ocean fish meal are listed 1st and fish meal is a nice tasty protein that they all enjoy, and also eggs for muscle growth, dried kelp, Taurine for heart health and L-Carnittine to help burn fat, a necessary ingredient when you are dealing with dogs of all different shapes and sizes with varying levels of activity and ages. I really love that there are no fillers, no artificial colors or artificial flavors-thank you! And there is prebiotic fiber to help with digestion issues and vitamins and omega fatty acids to help with skin and coat health and immune system functions.

"So pleased with this Epson Expression Photo XP-960! Our family takes and prints a lot of photos and we were on the lookout for the best home printer. This ""small-in-one"" was a breeze to set up and impressed us right out of the gate. I love that it is wireless and we can each print from our various iPads, smartphones and other mobile devices with router-free printing. The quality of the photos is the best I have seen - image quality is clean with no dropletting as with some other brands we've tried and the colors are crisp and bright. I really love this printer! It has photo auto-correction which is great and red-eye removal which is a must! The printing speed is impressive, as little as 11 seconds for the 4X6 inch size. You can also easily share photos by scanning them to Facebook and the cloud. I especially like the fold-over lid which holds your original copy in place as it scans. Its a nice touch that is much appreciated. As others have noted I would only use this for photo printing due to the cost of the 6 color ultra HD ink cartridges. If you do want to use it for a regular everyday printer, the ISO print speed (pages per minute) is 8.5 for black and white and 8.0 for color in the single-side mode.

Solid Gold meets all of our criteria and then some. First off, all of my cats love this stuff! They love the taste and the smell. They come running when I put this in their bowls - usually they take their time and act disinterested in food if it doesn't meet their smell test. I like the fact that the kibble pieces are really small and easily digestible. With other large kibble they tend to make a mess and crunch it and pieces get left on the floor. Not with Solid Gold- they devoured every little scrumptious morsel. And the ingredient list makes this cat mom very happy - chicken is 1st and that is a nice mild protein that they all enjoy, and cranberries to help with urinary issues (just like for humans) and also Taurine for heart health and L-Carnittine to help burn fat, a necessary ingredient when you are dealing with cats of all different shapes and sizes with varying levels of activity and ages. Solid Gold is a big hit with all of my cats and that is really saying something! As for the cost, I have paid similar prices for food from the vet and then the cats didn't like it so I think if they love it I will pay to find the right healthy food for them and this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8YAOIUG4M20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTP9S#wasThisHelpful","RV8YAOIUG4M20","A2KMV056844YV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KMV056844YV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Swiss Legend women's watch is very beautiful and yes , the clasp is complete and utter weirdness! I will admit that it took me a few tries to get this watch on. But once I did, it really was special. The mother-of-pearl dial with the rose gold tone stainless steel bezel is very striking and the watch has lots of bells and whistles. However, the actual watchband is silicone which is very rubbery and that is why I gave it 4 stars. I guess this is the style these days but I prefer a nice leather band on my watches.

I always recycle the paper tube from the roll, so I cannot see much advantage to a core-less roll. The rolls are much smaller than average due to the missing tube and will pack in a smaller place. When you place the roll on the toilet tissue holder, it fluffs out and looks just like a regular roll. It is a neat idea and I hope it will make the toilet tissue cheaper instead of more expensive. When the roll is almost finished, all the paper comes off with one pull.

"This thriller by Patricia Clark is about a serial killer who is going around DC and then other US cities killing lawyers by sticking them with a deadly poison. At first the deaths seem to be heart attacks, but increased investigation turns up puncture marks on the victims and suspected poisoning. Detective Pulaski of the DC police asks for help from the FBI and Shawn Cleary is assigned the case. She is an agent who is blames herself for her partner Trevor being paralyzed in a shoot out. She recruits Trevor on the case to do technical investigations. The real killer surprised me completely.  This book is a real page turner and I highly recommend it to all mystery lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKBXEAVRF2F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VD1EAI#wasThisHelpful","RKBXEAVRF2F3","A2KMV056844YV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KMV056844YV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite a pooping infant, I think this is just going to become a regular garbage can where it can do its job of containing trash less smelly than diapers.Because I can't see anything superior about this in the diaper pail world. I use a stainless steel diaper pail by Ubbi that is great for odors and this one doesn't compare. I put this on the same aroma standard as my old cheap plastic one I now use for dish rags. Good, but hardly the king of odor-blocking. Plus, for the price this one isn't that well-made.The good is that it's decent at its purpose. I don't want to call this a lousy diaper pail.  And it's really quite attractive which is why it's going the trash can route of life. It holds a lot (another win for trash can) which I dont know is the best desire for stinky diapers.

"It's good to find a trilogy that gets better as it goes along, and in my humble opinion the Fianna Trilogy did just that. The first book was a nice little fantasy romance that properly filled the niche, I further enjoyed the second, and this last installment really had me reading! Our reluctant heroine Grace becomes much less reluctant and more up to filling her duty as the veleda, even giving in to Druid training with a rather strange and ruthless teacher. And, as the series has promised, the terror of her choice at Samhain looms closer and both sides try to find Grace. The writing and storytelling are quite smart, and my one complaint is one little group became a little too problematic a little too fast... at least, I as a reader did not see it coming and found parts of such wrap-up underwhelming. Even so, it's a wonderfully satisfying final installment and I daresay the best of the bunch (good for ending).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NLJACU72MNTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503945723#wasThisHelpful","R3NLJACU72MNTE","AOTMP0OKJOUWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOTMP0OKJOUWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, the summary of my feelings: It's okay. Frankly, I largely think this would be a cute and fun wedding gift... but perhaps not something you necessarily want for yourself (is that so horrible to say? Give it to other people?) The theory is cool and charming... a mini ice-cream maker with little freezy mugs for a date night or something similar.The product works. I can't say it doesn't. This does make ice cream. But... I guess I just want the same quality ice cream as that big ol' electric bucket in the garage that I have to lug out and makes the loudest noise possible but makes a heck of an ice cream bunch. This is just... okay. Similar to something you can make for the fun of making ice cream.The product is really cute-looking, so that's a perk. But the process for these single-servings is a bit much and in the end, it's only decent. This is definitely a novelty item for the cuteness factor, and not for great homemade ice cream.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILT1QBS83ZYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144PQZZK#wasThisHelpful","R1ILT1QBS83ZYG","AOTMP0OKJOUWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOTMP0OKJOUWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perhaps I'm entering a phase of my literary life where (horrors!) I'm losing my taste for fantasy, because this book just did not do it for me. It was just all too much for me who may be now seeking something more practical. So, I still tried to look at the book from a fantasy point of view... and still wasn't impressed. I love the idea of the ""aftermath"" scenario, a fantasy war idea that doesn't get enough exploration, but the result here was a rather bleak and depressing area that only seemed to thrive on that aspect. Okay. Give me more! The writing is quite lyrical, though some may find it too flowery. The plot is well-thought-out, but almost painfully slow, the moodiness of the characters and the setting getting most of the attention.

"So, first and most impressive reaction to this: cool, looks great, provides lots of blocks. When thinking of this as a kid's toy, what more do you want? So an easy and well-deserved 4 stars for that aspect: cool blocks of good quality in high quantity. The modern architecture spin is a nice perk as well.

"I hate to say it, but this is one of those books entirely dependent on the reader for recommended enjoyment and thus fairly impossible to recommend or condemn. I liked it quite a lot. Some may love it all the more. Some might find it psychotic drivel.So be aware you're getting into a black comedy that is both hysterical and sad in the oddest of ways. This is a satire of our modern literary world, Faust, and some possible comment of something else altogether.The writing. The syntax is a delight unto itself and makes this a book to get into easily.The characters. Great. Can't say enough good about them. Quirky and interesting to the extreme.Plot. Thorough.

"This is a charming little fluff read I managed to happily read in one sitting due to its engaging storyline and upbeat writing. It's a fairly familiar story of a woman who finds herself abandoned by a wealthy husband and suddenly needing to work things out for herself--seen in a few movies and books, but still plenty delightful particularly when done well as it is done here.Jessie Stanton is dumped from her high class life of wealth when her husband disappears with all the assets. She pawns off her ring to pay for the services of private investigator Danny Callahan and to start a business renting out her designer clothes.It's a fun cast of characters Jessie leads, each one likable, and the plot moves along briskly as Danny searches for Jessie's husband, Jessie and her friends put together a new business, and Jessie and Danny deal with their attraction to one another.Add in a dash of Christian message to make this a fun yet quite worthy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GSGEOYHXFT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426711603#wasThisHelpful","R6GSGEOYHXFT9","AOTMP0OKJOUWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOTMP0OKJOUWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What is there to love if not a good dog tale? Here is one of the classic kind, a beloved companion on the road with just the sort of man who needs the help of a good dog and a faith-promoting message of God and forgiveness. Jim Kraus is comfortable in his writing and tells this story in an easy-going, thoughtful manner. Lewis, the titular St. Bernard, is quite the most saintly of animals indeed with his insistence for telling the truth and his interactions with the obviously suicidal George are heart-warming. My only wish is for a choice between more or shorter story. It plods along at a nice and comfortable pace with nice bits of inspiration and warm fuzzies but without too much action and an obvious direction to the conclusion.

Requiring very little oil for operation, this diffuses a nice flow of air that fills a moderately sized room (I've been keeping it in my kitchen).

Not perfect, but certainly well-made and sturdy with great metal. My big issue concerns the tongs, the kind with a clasping mechanism that in my experience doesn't always last well long. I'm the type that would prefer more basic and trusty tongs. Even so, they have held up well to so-far summer barbecues since these have arrived.

The safety features are respectable, and I find the seat cover design quite cozy and snug and so far have had no problems with the buckling system.Bulkiness... alas, it's not as trim and compact as other, fancier seats and that might be considered good or bad--I'm just telling it like it is.So, here it is, another Graco car seat of simplicity.

"This is the second year I attempted to grow Cherokee Purples. The first year, about 4 years ago, I started with the plants themselves and lost them to... heck, it was hot and I just couldn't keep any plants hydrated enough. This year, I remember the Cherokee Purples and purchased the seeds. They germinated nicely enough indoors and took to growing when I transplanted them outside. Thumbs up in that department.And onto the fruit. Other reviewers said they got quite the harvest from these. I haven't seen that yet. Rather, I've been having trouble getting blossoms to really do anything. I get that this is an heirloom variety and heirlooms aren't exactly known for the high yield of engineered seeds, but I had long heard Cherokee Purples gave a decent harvest. Perhaps I'll just let the season play out a little longer.All that being said, however, I have had a fairly decent crop so far and I'm very impressed with the fruit. The tomatoes are lovely and have a deliciously sweet flavor. Yay. Really, if you're looking for an interesting tomato that's not too outlandish, these are tasty.All in all, I'm happy with these seeds and shall continue my tomato season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYQKX0UPA9VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TQGTZU#wasThisHelpful","REYQKX0UPA9VD","AOTMP0OKJOUWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOTMP0OKJOUWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've had a Keurig for a number of years, and I honestly thought it was the best system for getting an affordable cup of coffee that there was.I was totally wrong.I had seen the Ninja Coffee Bar commercials but I thought that, like most infomercials, they were trying to sell something that simply wasn't anywhere near as good as they made it out to be. But when they claim that this makes one of the best cups of coffee you've ever had, they're right!! I have no idea how this machine works so well, but it is amazing.We recently returned from a vacation where we met a Brazilian couple who told us that American coffee is ""dirty water"". After having coffee from this machine I completely understand what we were missing out on! It's delicious!PROS:- Delicious coffee. What do you buy a coffee maker for? Delicious coffee. This maker has delivered on every cup of coffee we've tried making so far, and we even bust open a few ""iced tea"" k-cups for the Keurig and, using the ""brew over ice"" feature, managed to make a number of delicious cups of iced tea - my son said it was far better than the Keurig version that the K-cups were made for!- Multiple sizes of coffee. We've made all of the sizes, from the carafe to the single cup, and if you follow the directions with how much grounds to put into the filter, the coffee always comes out tasting amazing, no matter what size you want.- Multiple strengths. My husband likes his coffee a bit strong. I prefer mine light. With this maker I'm able to use a breakfast blend, brew normal for me and then brew stronger for him on the next batch to get two cups of coffee, in less than 5 minutes, that are made for both of our tastes.- Reusable filter. I've had reusable filters before with my old coffee makers but nothing like this one. You can tell it's high quality from the second you hold it. I don't foresee ever having to use a paper filter.- Looks amazing. Style counts for something, right? This maker definitely looks fantastic sitting on the counter.- Milk frother. It's actually way better than I thought it would be! My children even made hot cocoa and used the frother to make some milk to put on top of the cocoa, then added a bit of cocoa powder to make an amazing looking hot chocolate!CONS:- Size. Either I have lower cabinets or this simply isn't designed to fit under cabinets, I'm not 100% sure which, but I know it's about a half an inch too tall to fit under my cabinets. But that's honestly not that big of a deal for me because the coffee is so good that I have no problem giving it a place of honor on our counter! If, however, space is an issue then I would recommend checking the dimensions carefully before ordering.VERDICT:My husband was extremely skeptic when we got this after he saw the price. Then I made him a travel mug of coffee. He sipped it. Then he sipped again. Then again. He then looked at me and said, ""I get it...freaking a that's good coffee"" then wandered off to watch his hockey game. If Mr. Cheapskate approves of it, it has to be worth it!! I love showing off our coffee bar to anyone who comes over and can't wait to experiment more with different coffees!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXY6XPNXNGV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160R1LEK#wasThisHelpful","R2UXY6XPNXNGV2","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is stunned by this watch. He's not someone who wears tons of watches, but whenever we go out to eat or go out for a day together he does like to wear one.

"I'm in love. That's all I can say - I'm in love with this perfume! I'm someone who doesn't wear perfume often - not because I don't like perfume, but because it tends to be tricky for me to find a scent that I not only like but that also works well with my body chemistry.When I got this perfume I put a spritz on my wrist and rubbed and a spritz that I walked through. I wanted to make sure the scent was thoroughly on me to see how strong it was, if it was off-putting or if it wasn't too bad. Firstly, the scent was definitely not too strong. Every person that I came across I asked to smell my perfume. I wanted to see what their opinion was without me telling them how expensive the perfume was. Every single person sniffed my wrist and their eyebrows shot up. ""wow - that smells REALLY good!"" they all said! My husband, Mr. Cheapskate himself, took a whiff and immediately said that he loved the smell - then he started sniffing my neck to ask if I'd put any there!I have now learned that you should ignore the price of something and go with what works for you. This perfume absolutely works beautifully for me and has enough of a scent that it smells amazing but not so much that it's cloying. I'm definitely a fan!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQELLV50KLMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089HMWCA#wasThisHelpful","R2DQELLV50KLMS","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first activity and sleep tracker so I was extremely excited to see what all of the fuss is about. I wasn't disappointed!PROS:-Looks. The UP2 looks amazing! Everyone I showed it to was shocked that it tracked activity and sleep because they all said that it looked like a piece of jewelry. That definitely makes it more appealing to use!-Tracking. I never realized how crappy I slept until this!! Apparently I toss and turn a lot in bed, and it's interesting to see that! I also loved tracking my movements and the fact that I can set the UP2 to buzz me whenever I'm being truly lazy.CONS:-No Display. Although I absolutely love the look of the tracker, it would be amazing to be able to have a simple display that pops up showing the time and maybe the amount of steps that you've taken, but the fact that it doesn't definitely isn't a deal breaker.-Alarm. Yeah, no. I set the alarm to wake me up with a ""gentle buzzing"" and realize that if I had used this to wake up every morning, I'd be late all the time. The buzz is enough to wake you up, but all you have to do is smack it and it shuts off, which allows you to fall back to sleep way too easily.OVERALL:The UP2 is a sleek and gorgeous tracking device that helps you to track your activity and sleep, and that also gives advice on how to get healthier without being obnoxious about it. I'm definitely a fan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDROINT6DZ1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIG8S#wasThisHelpful","R2EDROINT6DZ1G","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're an HP household, with three HP laptops in our home, so we're definitely familiar with the HP brand and how their computers work. One thing we don't have is a convertible laptop and we were all anxious to give this a try.PROS:-Small. It's perfect if you're going somewhere or if you just want to laze on the couch and browse the internet. The size is definitely an asset as you can easily move this laptop from room to room, unlike my 17"" laptop which feels like a brick to move around.-Cost. My son's HP laptop, with an i5 processor (middle of the road) went for a bit over $700. At just under $300 this laptop is a great price for someone who is working on a budget.-Three Different Modes. I honestly think that my favorite mode is what I call the ""tee-pee"" mode. This is where you bend the screen back just enough to have the laptop stand up like a teepee. It's ideal for watching Netflix hands-free, trust me on that one! I feel awkward using it in tablet mode, however, because I always feel like I'm going to mess something up with the keys, even though they stop working once you switch modes, but that's likely just me.-Touchscreen. There are definitely benefits to having a touchscreen, especially when you're running Windows 10. The laptop recognizes when you're in tablet mode and immediately switches the display to a more touchscreen friendly mode, much like how Windows 8 looked.CONS:-Speed. This isn't the fastest laptop out there, but for this price point it's not bad. We've noticed that it seems to run slower with Chrome than it does with Windows newer browser, Edge. As long-time Chrome users, Edge may take a bit of getting used to, but the added speed definitely helps.-Really a Tablet? I recently got an exercise tracker that required an app to use. I went to the Google Play store on the laptop, when I was in Tablet mode, and tried to download the app. It stated that I couldn't because the device I was using wasn't compatible. If they're going to market this as a tablet, I feel that it should allow you to download apps like you would be able to with a tablet.-Sound. Again, this is a small laptop so the sound isn't as good as I'd like it to be, but what really bugs me is that you can't adjust the treble and bass so you're stuck with it sounding how it sounds.-Switching Modes. Heads up: if you want to have the laptop automatically adjust your screen, you have to set it that way in the settings area. Initially the laptop does not register the changing motion and so if you're trying to watch something in ""tee-pee"" mode, the video stays upside down.VERDICT:At just under $300, this is definitely not a horrible laptop. My 14 year olds laptop was much more expensive, but he tends to do a lot of online gaming. I feel that this price, and this size, is ideal for my 11 year old daughter, who has basically confiscated it anyway. It's light and easy for her to tote around and it has all of the functions that she wants and needs it to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WKLQ5HJA6TJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KKFEPC#wasThisHelpful","R6WKLQ5HJA6TJ","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this shaver with the thoughts to give it to my daughter as her first shaver. She's 11 and I figured that, within the next year or so, this would be a great introduction for her to the world of shaving. I was so, so wrong and I'm super glad that I actually tried the shaver before I gave it to her.While she was sitting there I put the recommended head onto the shaver, I believe it's called the epilator head, and put it onto my leg. I IMMEDIATELY felt a stinging pain, much like you'd feel if you had gotten zapped with electricity.I've never had that type of experience with any shaver and you can bet that I'll be looking for something different to start my daughter off with.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4MCTER1CRO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTD2CNG#wasThisHelpful","RM4MCTER1CRO5","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will be the first to admit that I've always used less expensive makeup. Okay, so cheap makeup. I don't wear makeup every day, in fact as a photographer I usually only put it on if I'm shooting a wedding or if my husband takes me out on a date (which is definitely rare!!), so I generally go for pretty cheap makeup. I never saw a reason to spend money on high quality makeup, so I honestly thought when I got this eye shadow palette that I wouldn't see much of a difference between the cheap makeup I purchase and this kit.I was wrong. I was so, so wrong.Firstly, it comes in a beautiful, heavy case - you can definitely tell that it's all there. Secondly, the minute I put my makeup brush to the eye shadow I could tell the difference. It was so silky and smooth and came away from the cake of makeup beautifully. I applied it and again could tell the difference because it is so, so light. Not that the color is light, but it FEELS like when it's on your eye! My daughter and I had an absolute blast trying all of the colors in various combinations, and it seems to stay on very well! The good news, though, is that it also washes off with just soap and water.The sparkly colors don't go on overly sparkly, but do add a little bit of shine to your eye. They blend together absolutely amazingly on the eye as well - I'm very, very happy with this kit and now I realize that I'll have to spend a little more on my makeup if I want to get the same results that I'm getting from this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EB0Q4QQ293JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013I5DGAO#wasThisHelpful","R1EB0Q4QQ293JV","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our family is pretty used to playing board games and we were excited to get to try Dragons Gold.PROS:- Easy to Understand Instructions. Unlike some games, these instructions that come with Dragon's gold are thorough and very easy to understand, which made setting up, then playing the game, very easy.- Fun Pieces. Okay, being able to have gems to physically play with is definitely fun!- Simple Gample. It's not complicated, it's very easy, and while the game says you have to be over the age of 12 to play, I'd argue that a smart 10 year old could easily play it.- Advanced Version. I love that there's a simple version and an advanced version. Now that we've gotten the hang of the simple version, we're definitely excited to try the advanced one.CONS:- Repetitious. While the game is fun, it does get a little repetitious. While my two kids (14 and 11) and I will likely pull it out to play a few times, my husband says it's not his cup of tea because of the repetition.OVERALL:This is definitely a fun game for families to play.

"So I have an 11 year old daughter who was interested in these adorable AmiGamis and while I was hoping it would entertain her for longer, overall we're both pretty please with the set.I won't bore you with how it works, as I'm sure many other reviewers will tell you everything, but instead will tell you how long it kept my daughter entertained. 30 minutes. That's how long she played with them. Now to be fair my 11 year old likes to decorate something one way and then leave it that way, so children who like to change things up will likely get much more play time out of them, but she folded the paper, put stickers on, and then put it on her shelf and left it there.

"So where I live we have some pretty crappy internet. It's high speed, but the lowest high speed you can get, unfortunately. The only place the line can come in is in our bedroom, which is on one end of the house, while everyone else usually spends time in the other end of the house. We're a pretty technological family - 3 laptops, 2 tablets, smart TV, Wii U, and Amazon's Echo are all connected all the time. Recenly we also got Nintendo's Splatoon, where you get to play online against other people, and both my 14 year old son and I were constantly getting frustrated because we would be in the middle of a game that we were winning only to get kicked offline. I first thought that it was the internet, simply because I know it's not the best.Then I had the opportunity to try the Amped Wireless Extender and I thought, ""hey, maybe we're not getting a strong enough signal and that's the problem."" When the box arrived I simply took the unit out, plugged it in and followed the on-screen directions and, within 10 minutes, I was hooked up to the wireless and ready to go.One thing to know is that you have to set your computer/electronic gadgets to the new wireless access point in order to get the access you want. As soon as I did that to my computer it went from 3 bars to 5! Even on the back porch! I hooked the new wireless point to the Wii U and turned on Splatoon, hoping and praying that it worked, and it did!! Now occasionally I do get kicked offline on the Wii U but it went to getting kicked off 5 times out of 10 to getting booted maybe 2 times out of 10, which I can attribute to our internet and can definitely handle.My entire family is extremely impressed with how much this extender has helped to connect everyone in our house better wirelessly and I'll definitely never be without one again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQCU3MASYDK1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBK0BBU#wasThisHelpful","RQCU3MASYDK1X","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seriously smells amazing. It's hard to describe the scent - the first whiff I got wasn't that great, but as I started using it a sweet, but not overly-sweet, fruity-scent started filling the shower and the steam actually accentuated the smell.

Now I have absolutely no idea why they won't stay on this bed, as they have with many others, but we'll continue to keep working with them on it and trying to figure it out.I absolutely adore this bed. Our children's friends have all come here and jumped on it (this is after we attempted to have the dogs use it, it was clean of kid scent when we attempted it), and surprisingly enough, the cats have sort of taken it over! We have 4 cats and three of them absolutely LOVE the bed.

I should've enjoyed spending time with my family, getting out with the kids and the husband, adventuring around our area and enjoying the early summer weather.In both cases I SHOULD have done something - but instead I spent my Sunday arguing with my kids, and my husband, over whose turn it was to play Splatoon. You'd think a 35 year old woman wouldn't be able to get easily addicted to a game. Yeah, you'd be wrong! I even spent two hours this morning playing the game when I should have been working. Splatoon is everything I've ever wanted in a shooter game, and so much more. Let me preface this by saying that I stink - I really stink - at almost all shooter games. My husband has been playing Goldeneye on the Wii for years and gets addicted, and I honestly never understood his obsession with the shooter game until Splatoon came out. The great thing about this game is that even though I stink at first person shooter, it's okay! The main purpose of the game is to get the most ink on the map, NOT to kill the most people, so not only do I have a chance at doing good, I've been one of the number one players for my teams a vast majority of the time, which is not something I'm used to!PROS:- Great for all ages. My husband and I love it, our 14 year old is obsessed, and even our 11 year old daughter loves it too!- Perfect for the non-shooter gamer. Let me repeat: THIS IS NOT A GAME FOCUSED ON SHOOTING OTHERS! Yes, you can spent your time taking out the opposition, but you may not get the most points. You can also, however, spend the most time putting ink on the map and you can get tons more points, which translates into in-game money, which lets you buy gear that makes your character better. So shooting? Not the main priority.- Awesome colors. I haven't seen anyone comment on the colors yet - they're amazing. I'm a visual person and seeing the contrasting colors go against each other, pink and bright yellow, purple and teal, blue and orange - it's a visual feast for the eyes.CONS:- The connectivity isn't always the best. Now this could be because of the servers, or it could be because our internet isn't anywhere near as fast as I'd like it to be. Honestly the connectivity isn't horrid, but there's nothing like having 4 seconds left in a game that your team is winning only to have the game cut out. GAH!- There's no way to be able to play with either local friends or others online. It would be nice to be able to set up a four person team, or a two person team, but right now there's no reliable, easy way to do that.OVERALL:I'm in serious love with this game - my whole family is. If you look at the price and think, ""that's a little too expensive."" I completely understand - I thought the same thing. In fact our son paid for half of the game because I wasn't convinced it would be worth the money. After making the whole family take turns playing the game on Sunday, my son noted that I absolutely loved the game and asked if I'd pay him back his money LOL. Seriously, though - well done by Nintendo. I can see a bunch of other companies copying this style of game very soon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3O0FOO5RV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFCV32#wasThisHelpful","R3G3O0FOO5RV2","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always hear that goji berries are extremely healthy for you, and if that is the case than it is something that I could definitely eat. Many healthy products taste absolutely nasty, but after having five adults try these, this is the conclusion as to the taste:""At first bite it's a bit leathery - then you get a slight prune taste, or, a slight tart taste, but nothing very strong. The taste then finishes with a slight tin-y tang.""The aftertaste wasn't the favorite of anyone, but my husband did do as the bag suggested and made a sort of ""tea"" out of a handful of berries.

"First let me say that I haven't noticed a HUGE difference in our air quality or in the amount of dust/dander we have. Now, let me also say that we have 3 cats and 4 dogs and it's quite possible that this purifier has decided that we simply have far too many animals for it to handle. But when we were sitting in the same room with it (the dining room is where we placed it - we have an open living plan) we did notice that the air seemed to be a bit fresher, and it was definitely nice and cool. The dusting went down a tiny bit, but again, I've only tried using it during allergy season (and we have no environmental allergies in the house) and with all the animals. I will continue to use this and will update later this summer when our oldest cat, who is allergic to something about the end of summer, tends to have issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QUN6FEMUEQUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBJ8PDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QUN6FEMUEQUM","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This playpen was ideal for housing baby bunnies in my house. As a photographer I do a shoot once a year with baby bunnies and this worked beautifully!

Be aware: there is! Even though we can't chuck this nearly as far as our medium sized one, our dog LOVES this ball. We have 2 Giant Malamutes and believe it or not this is one of the few toys that he has not managed to totally destroy yet!

"I apparently had a much different experience than the other reviewers of this stapler. It came and was very easy to set up, which is great, but when we tried to use it we found that it has one fatal flaw: if you want to staple 20 pages, it's great - if you want to only staple two or three together it will staple so hard that the back end of the staple comes through the front side making anything you've stapled become a weapon! We fiddled with it for awhile and my husband immediately said that it should have some way to dial the intensity back a bit, but apparently that's not possible. So while it may be great for stapling large quantities of paper together, it's not so hot for stapling just a few.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX211HG6KSW4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIM5L6O#wasThisHelpful","RX211HG6KSW4H","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The problem with this conditioner is that how it works depends on the type of hair you have (which isn't too much unlike other conditioners).My 10 year old daughter used it and she not only loved the smell, she also has found that her hair is much easier to control, and in Vermont's frigid cold weather her hair was filled with static. This conditioner actually helps keep the static down!My hair, however, didn't fare as well. I took a shower on Thursday evening. By Saturday morning my hair was very greasy-looking. I can usually go two days without having to wash my hair but this conditioner has shown that my hair is apparently more greasy than I thought it was!The best part of this conditioner is the smell - it smells FABULOUS. I now have an obsession with finding other fig-smelling items to see if they smell as good!!VERDICT:If you have dry hair, this is ideal for you.

"This is the first time we've had a memory foam mattress in our house so know that this review is coming from a total memory foam mattress virgin.We got this bed for our 14 year old son and immediately knew we wanted it to be a platform bed. When the bed arrived it was in a VERY tiny box. The box was so small that I worried that it was an inflatable mattress! But once you get the bed out of the box it decompresses in less than 24 hours.PROS:- Comfortable!! It definitely has a very firm feel to it, but it's really, really ridiculously comfortable. A friend told me that memory foam mattresses are ""relationship killers"" because all you want to do is sleep in them, and I can totally see that now!- Actually very cooling. The mattress truly doesn't get very hot. I'm anxious to see how it does this summer!- Chemical smell - so the chemical smell isn't a plus, but the fact that the smell goes away pretty quickly IS a plus. We live in a cold climate so the smell was a bit stronger than we expected, but the smell went away in less than 2 days.- Works great as platform bed. We prefer platform beds here but this works well as one! You just have to make sure that you have a solid foundation under the mattress so that it doesn't sag between the slats. We purchased this frame to use and so far it's working beautifully!

He usually tosses and turns a bit but we've found that he tends to do so less with this mattress, and he sleeps very deeply, so yay!I definitely, absolutely love this bed! It's important to know that if you're used to a ""regular"" spring mattress it's definitely more firm (for example we have a pillow-top mattress and it feels very different) but once you get used to the firmness it feels really great, and I'd imagine that if you had back issues it would help a lot!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWRK7SX0O60U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWTJ9OA#wasThisHelpful","R1HWRK7SX0O60U","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've definitely had some fun with this blender!First, we decided to really check the power and make kool aid slushies. The machine had more than enough power to crush all of the ice quickly and easily.Then we made shakes and used the program mode on the blender. It went well, but we actually had to turn it on a little more so that we were able to get rid of all of the chunks of ice cream out of the shake.Next was smoothies. We did two different kind of smoothies - one with all frozen fruit and another with half frozen, half fresh, and both smoothies were made to the perfect texture.This blender does what it says it's going to do - nothing more, nothing less. The bonus parts? The suction cups on the bottom of the blender which helps the blender to avoid moving all around the counter. Another bonus that I loved? There is a place on the bottom of the blender where you can wind up the cord, making it easy to store it on your counter - if your cabinets are high enough to do so as this blender is REALLY tall.

"We were introduced to Munchkin about a month ago, and we love it. It's a game that the whole family can play (we have a 10 year old daughter and 14 year old son) and we really enjoy it, so we were excited to try Munchkin Panic. We've never played Castle Panic so it took a little while to figure out the rules - but, just as with the Munchkin game, the rule book does make it fairly easy to figure out.The first game we played took about an hour and a half - most of that, I think, is because it took so long to figure everything out. The next game, though, was less than an hour. There are still a few things we're not completely clear of, such as what to do if a monster destroys the tower - does it stay there or does it get taken off? - but overall we definitely like the game!

"I have no idea why some people have said that this doesn't warm up well - it definitely does! Yes, it takes four or five minutes to get hot, but it says to expect this in the instructions.PROS:-Easy to store.-Makes the panini perfectly with no pressure needed. It says to not push down on the lid and it means to not do that. The weight of the top is perfect to create a delicious panini-Doesn't make just panini's! My daughter and I sliced a few pieces of french bred and made some freaking amazing french bread pizza on this thing. We put down a piece of aluminum foil first and used the knob on the side to keep the top from pushing onto the pizza. We loved it so much we made it two days in a row!-Easy to clean. We spray the plates with nonstick cooking spray and then just wipe it down once it's cooled and it cleans perfectly.CONS:-The knob. While it's nice that the knob can help lock the top in place, it's not perfect. The knob is on the right side so the left side droops down when you lock it.

"We purchased this TV when our old one was on the fritz and so far we're in LOVE. The television is definitely a unique size - you don't see a lot of 58"" tv's, but it's perfect. The big thing I want to note is the weight. We got our last TV about 8 years ago. This TV is 12"" bigger and 20 lbs lighter! Because of that we were able to use the same stand we'd used for the previous TV.As for the television itself, the only complaint I have is that the remote seems to react a little sluggishly, but other than that, it works beautifully. We had some movies on a memory stick. I stuck the stick into the back and was easily able to watch the movie. Not only that, the next day I put it back into the back of the television and the TV is SO smart that it remembered where I was in the movie and started it there! THAT impressed me!

"I had a problem that a similar reviewer did. The stripping worked beautifully on windows, but it didn't stay stuck on the door at all - which really bummed me out because it truly did help keep the cold out.

"I'm not sure what happened to the reviewer who had a problem installing this surface because not only did it go on beautifully for us, it also has stayed on like it was designed to be there.PROS:-Easy Installation. My husband and I made sure to make this level by bringing out, well, a level, and by marking it with pencil on the wall. The bottom of the surface is taped to the tube it comes wrapped around and we used this to help weigh down the surface so that it went on easily. We undid a bit of the backing on the surface, attached it to the wall and slowly but surely smoothed the surface down the wall. The bubbles came out very easily and before we knew it, the surface was on the wall! It did help that there were two of us doing it.-Writes beautifully. Even though you can feel the wall behind the dry erase surface, the surface is so slick that the markers glide right over any small little bumps that may be on the wall. SMALL bumps. I'm sure if there were a large bump you'd feel it LOL.-Erases even more beautifully. This comes with an erase cloth which both my daughter and I found to be MUCH better than any eraser we've ever used!CONS:-No markers. It comes with no markers. This may be a little thing, but since it comes with an eraser cloth I kind of feel like it should come with some markers too LOL.-No holder. There is no holder that goes with this (that I know of) which is why we spent a bit of time taking an old yogurt container, decorating it, and adding it to the wall next to this surface with a hook. It's perfect for holding the markers but if Post-it created something that is designed to hold markers with this system, that would definitely be ideal!!VERDICT:We're in love with this surface. It is HUGE! It's more than large enough for a number of children to be drawing on it at the same time, and I really feel like while the company should market to businesses, they should also market to parents of children because it simply is a perfect way to get a huge white board quickly and easily!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTR95NGGB0RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1D5QU#wasThisHelpful","R1MTR95NGGB0RT","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am definitely not very impressed with this rug. Firstly, the rug came curled up in a box. When we unrolled it (it was shrink-wrapped) we found there was a huge flaw with this rug: it wouldn't unfurl fully. We thought that maybe it had gotten cold during the trip to our home (Vermont in autumn is known for being chilly) so we set it up and decided to give it a few days to see if it would decide to get tame and lay down. It has been over 5 days and the rug still has not lay flat, even though we put it in an area where it would be walked on to try to help ensure that the edges went flat. They haven't.Also, the design isn't very clear in the rug. If you have someone hold it up and you stand away from it, you can see the design. If, however, it's on the floor as it's designed to be, you definitely can't see the full design. It looks more like a gray shag carpet with no real design.I would not purchase this rug again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UW5ZEK60SQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PJ64P8#wasThisHelpful","R11UW5ZEK60SQY","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So the fact that we got 3 scissors in one pack is absolutely fantastic and means that we'll have scissors for awhile! Not only is the amount of scissors you get amazing, the fact that these scissors cut almost effortlessly is honestly one of the most amazing things ever.

"We've played all the other Just Dance games, so we had to get this one!PROS:-Amazing music! It seriously has some of the best music I've seen on any of the just dance games!-Great reactions.

Having things in the background definitely takes a whole new dimension to the game!-Online play - being able to play someone online is really fun and makes it fun even if you're just playing by yourself!CONS:-Difficult interface.

"There has been a lot of talk about games getting more high def, but what many people aren't talking about is the fact that the audio is also getting more high def as well. Play a first person shooter and you may find yourself in serious trouble if you can't hear every small sound. Miss that crunch of boot on gravel and you may wind up being killed by your enemy. Turn your television up too loudly, however, and you wind up annoying anyone in the rooms around you. These headphones are definitely one ideal solution.PROS:-Connects quickly and easily. We managed to have the headphones hooked up to the Xbox within just a few minutes. A couple of tweaks and the sound and the mic were both working beautifully.-Adjusting sounds separately. I personally loved this. I loved that I could adjust the mic and the sounds separately. It definitely made it easy to find the perfect level on both, and relatively quickly too.-Completely wireless! No connecting to the controller! I hadn't realized how tethered I'd felt before until I gave this a shot. Not having to worry about that wire definitely changed things quite a bit!-Extremely comfortable. The earphones are padded beautifully, and so is the head piece. The combination of padding allows for you to wear the headphones for over an hour with relative comfort. I haven't worn them for longer than an hour and a half yet, but so far they've been comfortable the whole time I've worn them.-Multiple uses. We not only used this on the Xbox, we hooked it up to the computer as well. The microphone does not work on the computer (I do not believe it is supposed to - I'm guessing it's a driver issue), but the sound works beautifully on the computer as well, making this an electronic device that has multiple uses, which is exactly what we love in this household.CONS:-No mic on computer. As I've said, the microphone does not work when hooked to the computer, but the company does not claim that it does. I, however, wish they could fix the driver issue so that it could - that would make these go from fantastic to absolutely amazing.VERDICT:These headphones are absolutely perfect and do exactly what the company says they do. They work beautifully, wirelessly, and are extremely comfortable to wear for fairly long periods of time and I am extremely happy to have them! Now if only I could wrestle them away from my 13 year old son...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGCWKPGI17GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQACMM#wasThisHelpful","R3KGCWKPGI17GH","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Firstly I've had a lot of kitchen towels, but most of them have been unsuccessful at drying dishes well. These towels, however, absorb the water SO GOOD! We did a large load of dishes and the towel was SOAKED - but it was still holding water!! We put it in the bath tub to drain and, the next morning, it was completely dry!Towels always fall off my stove handle - I'm sure a lot of people have this issue. These towels, however, are the perfect size to stay on the rack and haven't fallen off once!

"This is definitely not your typical book, which is probably what I liked the most about it. told in many lists (although not entirely in lists), this is definitely a unique book. I have read a LOT of books, but this is definitely the first I've read that incorporates lists in it like this. However in reading this the first thing that came to my mind was something my literary professor in college said a long time ago. To paraphrase, he basically said that you have to learn to write correctly in the English language and to have a good plot before you go mucking around with using grammar incorrectly.Now, telling a story with lists isn't necessarily using grammar incorrectly, but it doesn't necessarily help the story. As you'll read, many reviews say that it helps to understand teenagers and their ""one word answers"", but having a teenager myself, and knowing and working with many teenagers, it really isn't that difficult to get more than a one word answer from them.But back to the story. I felt badly for Darren and all that he was going through at such a crucial time in his life, but it sort of felt like an avalanche of crap was thrust on him all at once. And, sometimes, that's exactly how life is. Unlike many teens, who feel like their life is horrible when all that's wrong is that they've lost cell phone reception, Darren truly deals with a very difficult time. It is the struggles he faces, and how he takes those challenges and learns from them, that helped me enjoy this book, not the fact that lists were heavily sprinkled throughout the work. My advice to the author would be to stop employing gimmicky tactics and to start focusing more on story. A great story needs absolutely no gimmicks to propel it to the top.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LOBRLHE82H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442495731#wasThisHelpful","R23LOBRLHE82H3","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, this Bluetooth speaker definitely surprised me. I expected something this tiny to have absolutely no power - I was definitely wrong!! Firstly it was very easy to set up with bluetooth. We had my daughter's Samsung Galaxy Tab hooked up to it very quickly after we powered it up.What shocked me the most is that this little speaker definitely makes your phone (or Tab) sound much louder than the little speakers that come with it do. The design of the cube seems to allow the music to reverbrate through the tube beautifully, giving a halfway decent sound. Now, you don't have the huge bass you would have if you spend hundreds of dollars on an expensive bluetooth speaker, but if you're putting your phone in a plastic cup to get the sound louder, this is DEFINITELY a better option and has a much better sound!Disclaimer: I received this product to test for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RIFYD4P3DKZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX2YXTY#wasThisHelpful","R2RIFYD4P3DKZ2","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones are absolutely fantastic no matter whether you have a Playstation or not!! We do not have a Playstation but are huge music lovers and had not yet found a good wireless headset that sounded great and that had an affordable price point. These headphones meet almost every desire we have for a headset.PROS:- Works beautifully with our computer and with our tab. We hooked up the USB stick that comes with the set (the set also comes with tons of other wires that allow you to use these headphones for multiple things) and got it set up fairly easily. Once we had it synced up (took less than 10 seconds once we figured out how to do it), music was pumping out quickly!- These headphones have some serious range! We got about 50 feet away and the headphones worked beautifully. When my husband got out of range it didn't stutter but just shut off. Then, the second we got back in range, it was back on again and it was all done extremely smoothly.- The sound is great! I'm picky about sound but the bass and treble both seem to be beautifully set and so far all the different types of music we've listened to have sounded absolutely fantastic!- Once we synced it once to my laptop I simply had to put the USB stick in again and the headset was automatically synced to it. Nice!CONS:- The syncing takes a second to figure out. Make sure that you read the instructions before you try to set it up, and that you have something small like a paperclip as you have to push it into the hole to get the USB stick to start the sync process. This seems a little clunky to me and while I guess it helps to prevent someone from accidentally hitting the sync button while they're using it, it's kind of a pain to deal with.- It's LOUD! My husband turned them up about as loud as they could go and was easily over 30 feet away from me and I could definitely hear him listening to Stan Bush's ""The Touch"" (yes, he's a huge Transformers fan!). I'm definitely going to keep an ear out to make sure that the kids aren't listening to it too loudly.- Not noise cancelling. You can still hear someone trying to talk to you. Granted, they may be muted a bit if you're listening to loud music but there's no excuse for saying that you couldn't hear someone calling you LOL.VERDICT:While we have not used these headphones for gaming or speaking through, I can tell you from a music lover's point of view that these headphones are absolutely fantastic and should definitely not be pigeonholed into being thought of as simply a gaming headset!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKXV6K8CXT12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQAACO#wasThisHelpful","R1CKXV6K8CXT12","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If I had one of these when I was little I would have terrorized my entire family daily! This TerraDrone is something that is extremely fun and is something that has actually bonded my husband and son a bit!PROS:- SERIOUSLY FUN! Yes, this is a huge pro because for the first time there's a cool, great-working Nerf remote control vehicle that you can fire darts from while sitting in your chair. It's perfect for terrorizing the cats! (note: I've never hit them, the remote control vehicle simply crawling towards them freaks them out enough!!)- Works well. Unlike other RC vehicles, this spider-like vehicle is designed to be used very easily. The remote control has 3 buttons - one that points the turret up and down, one that rotates it, and one that makes the TerraDrone crawl forward or backwards. Whatever direction the turret is pointing, that is the direction that the TerraDrone walks forward! This makes so much sense as you simply point the turret where you want to go and press forward towards your target.- Easy to load the darts. The cartridge simply pops out and you load the darts gatling-gun style.- Not difficult to put together. My husband and son had it put together in under 30 minutes, which, for them, is impressive because generally when they start working on a project together argument arise, but this was a pretty painless process!CONS:- The sound. It's loud. Really loud. If you want to sneak up on someone? This is not the toy for you!- Time to fire. Once you get where you're going you hit the fire button, but be prepared to wait about 4-5 seconds for the dart to leave the chamber for the first round. Once the first round goes off the other darts come out pretty quickly but it seems like it takes a few seconds to get the first dart out.- Drifts to the left a bit. It's minor, but we have found when it's on a hardwood floor that it drifts to the left a little. On the carpet it has better grip.THE VERDICT:It's not the most perfect RC dart vehicle - but it's the best one I've seen and is SO much fun that you tend to forget about the little issues the TerraDrone has! Yes, having rubber bottoms on the TerraDrone would probably make it walk better on the hardwood floor, but who really cares?! You've got a remote control spider-like vehicle that fires Nerf darts!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J0VDH9GBEZKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILD5D7S#wasThisHelpful","R1J0VDH9GBEZKT","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Equestria Girls bring a whole new way to play with MLP, and my 10 year old was ecstatic to get her hands on these dolls.

You can remove their shoes (or, in one's case, boots) very easily! The dolls seem to be made to be much more sturdy than the previous EG dolls.Getting the dolls out of the package definitely stinks and it took both my daughter and I about 10 minutes to get everything fully unattached!!

I was worried that this would create a ""tinny"" sound as I'd seen other cases for this phone do that, but this doesn't! The sound is just as clear with the case on as it is when the case isn't on. I haven't dropped the phone yet, so I can't speak to how well it protects the phone during a drop, but I can say that so far it's protecting very well and it's SO light that you really don't feel it!!

"If you have an MLP fan, chances are that they'll want this castle no matter what any reviews say, and if they're that big of a fan, definitely get it for them because the little problems with the castle won't really matter to them.THE PROS:- Twilight and her outfits - as my daughter pointed out, her crown is wrong (she has a different crown now), but she comes with skirts that perfectly fit an alicorn, which is definitely fun!- Lots of little extras. The shoes, crown, and all the little pieces make play much more fun.- The keys! Oh the keys! That's all I heard about for an hour LOL. The castle comes with a few keys that can be used to lock and unlock (and in the book's case pop open) a few pieces in the castle, which really makes it interactive!- No stickers!! I get SO sick of stickers that come with sets like these - with this one, though, everything's already to go!THE CONS:-Putting together. Putting this together wasn't that easy. My 10 year old was unable to do it herself, and she's put a number of these types of toys together. The instructions were definitely clear, but she had a difficult time snapping certain parts together, and figuring out where, exactly, a piece or two went.-The slide. Put Twilight into the cloud car that comes with the castle and she can go down the slide! Only, not so much. Put her into the car and she sits fine. Try to let it go down the slide and she falls head first into the ground swiftly. Guess those wings don't work well after all!THE VERDICT:We've only had this a very short time so I'm not sure how well it's going to hold up. The slide seems pretty flimsy to me but we'll see!! Even though the castle isn't perfect AT ALL, my daughter is in love with this castle. She told me if she hadn't gotten it, it would be one thing she begged for for Christmas. So for hardcore MLP fans, it's a great addition, but for those who want a functioning castle? I'd look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N307D20JDNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM2TVX0#wasThisHelpful","R2N307D20JDNL","A1VTBADV3JS1EC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTBADV3JS1EC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Ivation 1800 Watt Portable Induction Countertop Cooktop Burner to give me extra cooking space while preparing foods for my large family. I have a classic, 4 burner stove, but it's still not enough space, especially during the holidays. The Ivation Cooktop Burner combined with a couple other portable cookware items I own have remedied that inconvenience and the burner has become a tremendous asset for me while cooking in my kitchen.I received the burner complete with a power plug and instructional manual. It is heavy duty and durable, yet easy enough to move around. It has a flat glass top that is easy to clean, a huge plus for a busy mother, and is easy to operate with touch button controls. I have included product pictures for reference.The touch control panel uses a digital display which I love and includes 10 programmable power levels. It can keep my foods warm at 140*, or be cooked on with a max temperature of 460* Fahrenheit. It's powered by 1800 watts and has a convenient built-in timer that can be set in 5 minute increments up to 3 hours. There's both a child lock and voltage warning system that keeps my family safe. An auto-off function will turn the burner off I f no cookware has been detected for 60 seconds.The burner will only work with induction cookware, which basically means it must be magnetic. If you're not sure that you own this type of cookware, find a magnet. If it sticks, you're good, but if not this either isn't for you, or you'll need to buy those new pans you've wanted, lol.All things considered, I am very pleased with the overall quality, durability, multiple functions and safety features, super quick heating time, extra cooking space, ease of cleaning and convenience the Ivation 1800 Watt Portable Induction Countertop Cooktop Burner provides.

"The Liberty Imports Big Ass Horn Fart Gun is a hilarious gag toy that is fun for both kids and adults... Namely, my husband, lol. The horn is larger than I thought and is well constructed. It ships in either blue, or pink and the color is random, something I did not notice when ordering. I got pink, when I expected blue, but it isn't a big deal because my 6 year old daughter prefers it over my 10 year old son who I was originally planning on gifting it to. I have included pictures for reference.The Fart horn has several components that enhance the enjoyment of the unique toy... There is an actual energy valve complete with lights, a pump action lever and the trigger controls the amount of irritable gas sounds the interesting device releases, haha. It requires 2 AAA, which are not included, but even with regular, more like constant use, I have not had to replace them.The toy is fun, but can be annoying, especially when the husband harassed you with it to entice laughter from the kiddos. I am pleased with the overall quality, durability and giggles it has brought to my home... Fart noises, Ass words and all.

"I use my pureSOL Activated Charcoal Facial Sponge daily and I absolutely love it! My face feels like I just had a facial and I used nothing but the sponge itself... No harsh, abrasive, chemical ridden cleansers. The sponge contains pure konjac root fiber that is naturally pH balanced for my skin and cleans deeply into my skin while being extremely gentle. This has been a great cleansing sponge for my acne prone skin and my blemishes have decreased dramatically.I thought it would have a scent and it does not, which I like. I have included pictures for reference.This all natural sponge is high quality, works as described and is nothing short of amazing! I like that it is eco-friendly, biodegradable and chemical free, even the packaging is 90% biodegradable! It doesn't contain any sulfates, parabens, or phthalates and the pureSOL sponge is completely vegan. Something I did not know was that the sponge comes from root of the konjac plant itself and is created by steaming the edible fiber. It comes with a built-in string and suction cup to hang on the wall, but I prefer to keep mine in the refrigerator anyway... It keeps the sponge fresh and it will last longer.I have an infant daughter and even though the sponge is meant for deep cleansing of acne prone skin, it is still soft enough to use on my baby without any irritation, or harmful chemicals. The sponge arrives dehydrated and is quite hard, but after a quick soak the sponge becomes very soft and ready for use.I couldn't be more pleased with the overall quality, durability, function and most importantly, the results the sponge provides.

I recieved them to use for the holidays, especially since I can adjust the colors to match, but they're great for bringing extra excitement to sports games, add elegance and charm to a bar, patio, or other areas that need something a little different than the normal. I received a 6ft strip of lights that are rolled up in a spool, remote with multiple functions, power supply, adapter box and instructional page.The remote came ready to use right out of the product box, which is perfect for gift giving. All I had to do was remove the plastic tab and it was ready to go. The power cord plugs into the adapter box and has an end for screwing into the lights and another for adding additional light strips. There's also a battery option for using the lights on vehicles, or away from a wall adapter, but I have not used that option. The light strip uses a 3M adhesive backing for applying the lights and it works to secure the lights on almost any surface, although flat, nonporous surfaces work best.After installing the light strip in my desired location, and plugging the adapter in, I began utilizing the remote. I love accent lighting and own multiple, similar products, but none have a remote as intricate as this one. There are multiple options for color(s), fading speed, flashing speeds, brightness, preset setting, setting your own, memory and schemes. I can use them to support my favorite team while entertaining, set them to red and green for Christmas, purple and orange for Halloween, and so on.

I have included product pictures for reference.I control the light bulb using the app from my iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, iPod, or android tablet. It requires a device that supports 4.0 Bluetooth to function properly. The app has a variety of options including over 16 million supported colors, not including white. There are 9 preset modes for ""Using Scenes"" which include Rainbow, Reading, Green Mood, Temptation, Candlelight, Disco, Party, Square Dancing and Alert. Each have their specific qualities from varying colors, flashing modes, fading, or breathing motions. The color can also be set simply by touching and moving my finger around a color dial that has virtually every color and shade known to man, lol. There's also a basic white that allows the light to be used in any setting. The light, regardless of color, can be dimmed by sliding my finger along a bar, so there is not just ""bright"", or ""dim"", but also everything in-between. The blinking/flashing of the lights can be changed to fit the atmosphere as well. A timer can be set that will automatically turn the lights on and off at specific times. The app can be set on a phone to allow calls, or other interruptions to come through, or be shut off.I can control up to 6 bulbs with the app and can set which ones to use at any given time, so I can control them individually, in a group, or in groups. I have linked my playlist with the app and the lighting can be set to beat to the music. There's also a mic function, so the device the app is being controlled from can be set next to a music source to have the light sync that way. The bulbs are easy to install and easily screw into the socket like any other light bulb with no special hardware needed.All things considered, I couldn't be more pleased with the overall quality, multiple functions, versatility, ease of installation, ease of use, vibrant lighting options and music/mic capabilities the light bulb provides.

The seals are made with food grade, BPA free silicone and I have not experienced any leaking. The infuser is unique with it's strainer and detachable basket. The bottle holds roughly 1-1/2 cups of water and is dishwasher safe.I enjoy the convenience of brewing on the go.

The convenient remote control requires 2 AAA batteries, which are not included, but I have not had to replace the batteries yet and the same controls are located on the top of the projector itself.I use the projector with my laptop and connect it using an HDMI cable, which is not included, but easy enough to obtain without adding much additional cost. There are ports for a USB, or SD card, so pictures and movies can be played that way as well. It is equipped with an audio jack for using with headphones, or to plug in speakers. The device does have its own audio output, but the speaker is located on the bottom of device, so hearing it can be difficult without raising the projector, so I recommend using your own speaker system for the best audio.I project onto the walls of my home, or a sheet for the best visuals. The picture is clear and great quality, although the room must be dark to enjoy the full video capabilities. It measures roughly 6x8"" and is extremely lightweight, making it easily portable. It's fun to use outside for a drive-in experience, but like I mentioned above, it must be very dark and it still needs a power source.All things considered, I am very pleased with the overall quality, durability, size, function, ease of use and portability the Abdtech 130"" Mini LED Projector provides, especially for the cost.

I received the following glass markers:*Christmas Stocking with White Rim and a Snowflake Against the Red Background*Cupcake in a Snowflake Baking Cup with Red Background, Fluffy White Frosting Adorned with Glitter and a Mistletoe Decoration*Mistletoe with Green Leaves and Red Berries*Santa Claus in a Red Hat with Fluffy White Beard*Christmas Ornament with Glitter Frosted Snow and Green Bow*Reindeer with Detailed Eyes, Red Ribbon Wrapped Horns Adorned with 3 Gold BellsEach glass marker is exquisitely detailed with a tiny magnet on the back and another that attaches it to a wine glass, or other, similar cup. To use them, I carefully remove the back magnet, position the charm in the desired location on the glass, place the back magnet on the inside of the glass to securely hold it in place. The small magnets are much stronger than I anticipated and will not allow the charm to slide, or become detached. They keep glasses from getting mixed up and the simple touch makes each glass transform into a decorative Christmas party accessory.The wine bottle opener is heavy duty and feels weighted in the hand. It easily opens any bottle of wine with minimal effort from the user. I center it over the wine bottle cork, twist it in place and while doing so, the winged handles will gradually rise. I push the wings down and the cork pops right out.All things considered, I couldn't be more pleased with the overall quality, durability, function, ease of use, detail and beautiful craftsmanship the Christmas Holiday Wine Gift Set provides. It will make the perfect gift for any professional, wine lover, or collector... I can't wait to give these out for Christmas!!

"I received the Catwalk 10x Silicone Star Shape Molds to use for making homemade soaps with my daughter. I received a set of 10 molds in only yellow and green. They were simply wrapped and tied in plastic with no product packaging. I have included product pictures for reference.The molds are very small, roughly quarter size, with textured edges and a 3D star on the bottom that will show on whatever is being made. They are truly non-stick and made from high quality, food gade silicone. The silicone is thick, so the edges hold firm and won't collapse when filled. They are dishwasher, oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, but clean easily in hot, soapy water... I wouldn't recommend a dishwasher, because of their small size and they don't hold enough to bake much of anything. Even mini-cupcakes would tower over these. All things considered, I do like the quality of the silicone and they make cute, tiny soaps, but I wish packaging and color variety had been better. I feel baking cups is a misleading description, since they are so incredibly small and the bag they came in had a lot to be desired for the asking price.

"I purcgased The Soap Exchange Vanilla Sandalwood Artisan Saving Soap to go with my shaving brush and old-fashioned barber blade. The soap arrived in a metal puck with a waterproof label, weighing 4.5oz. I have included pictures for reference.The tallow based soap was handmade on Fort Worth, TX with fresh, all natural ingredients. Sandalwood has been one of my favorite scents for as long as I can remember and the pairing with vanilla completes the perfect shaving ambiance. The mixture of Australian sandalwood, Madagascar vanilla, amber, musk, vetiver and jasmine essential oils invigorate my senses with the earthy, wood aroma. The other ingredients included: Grass fed tallow, stearic acid, distilled water, shea butter, potassium hydroxide, safflower oil, mango butter, cocoa butter, jojoba butter, kaolin clay, essential oils and fragrance. The soap is cruelty, chemical and toxin free. It is made without detergents, sulfates, petroleum, preservatives, sorbitol, triclosan, artificial colors, phthalates or any derivatives of the above.The soap works into a rich lather and provides plenty of lubrication for a smooth shave. The aftershave feel is amazing and I have not experienced any razor burn since I started using the Vanilla Sandalwood Shaving Soap.To use, I fill a bowl with hot water and soak my shaving brush. I then add a very small amount of water to the puck and wait roughly 5 minutes before using the brush, going between the bowl and puck until a rich, thick, amazingly scented lather is created. After I'm done I remove any excess water from the tin and allow it to fully dry before replacing the lid.I'm very pleased with the amazing quality, scent and function the soap provides.

"I received the Smart Pet Supplies Waterproof Hammock Backseat Cover for Pets to keep my beloved dog's fur off of my seats. My company doesn't necessarily enjoy riding with me just to be covered in dog hair by the end of our trip and the dog hammock has made a huge difference. It measures 56x54"" and keeps my dog more comfortable during our trips. I have included product pictures for reference.The cover is made from high quality, durable, waterproof polyester material. It protects my seats not just from pet hair, but mud, accidents and water as well. The hamkock has a convenient zipper feature that allows for someone to sit on half the seat, while my fur baby enjoys the other half. There are velcro covered openings that allow access to both seat belts and buckles, so I can even use my pup's harness.It is easy to install with adjustable straps and quick release clips. I can use it my car, mini van and my husband's large truck without issue. It is universal and works well with any vehicle that has headrests.

"I purchased the OneDayShop 4000 Lumen 3x Cree XM-L T6 LED Waterproof Flashlight to use while diving, camping, boating, at home for power outages and other outdoor activities where a waterproof flashlight is needed. I received the flashlight in a resealable ziploc bag along with a convenient neck rope. I have included product pictures for reference.The flashlight is rechargeable with 2 18650 batteries, which are not included, but I already had for other flashlights I use. It is completely waterproof and submersible with adjustable light control from low, to high. This is great feature to have, especially when underwater. It is designed from aviation aluminum, anti-slip materials and is double sealed to avoid water entering the device.I own other, similar flashlights, but none have the 4000 lumen power of my OneDayShop.

"The Homasy Portable Mini Dehumidifier works almost soundlessly and covers an area of 215sf (20 square meters). I have a hot tub in ty he terrarium are of my home and placed the dehumidifier in there to keep the humidity levels down. It has been working great to keep the moisture from leeching into other areas of my home. I have included product pictures for reference.The Homasy uses Peltier technology and is capable of removing up to 10 ounces of water from the air per day. It has a 16.9 ounce water tank and prevents mold, mildew and bacteria from growing in my home around my children.Operation is simple with single button operation and the lightweight, yet durable unit is easily portable. Sometimes I take it in my bathroom when I'm soaking, and I have used it in my kitchen when I'm spending the day cooking large meals. If I touch the button once, the device begins operating, a second touch turns it off.Once the maximum water level has been filled, a safety feature automatically turns the unit off. The convenient LED light informs me of what the dehumidifier is doing... Blue means it is on and functioning properly, while red means the tank is full and it has been shut off.I am very pleased with the overall function, durability, portability, capacity and quality the dehumidifier provides.

It is lighteight, yet can handle minor falls, which my children have proven.

"I grew up using hot water bottles for a variety of reasons. As a child they were given to me in stuffed animals to keep me warm at night and cuddle with. As an adult they still help to keep me warm and I still enjoy laying with them at night, but they're also great for cramps, especially menstrual cramps, when someone is sick and for injury pain relief. I received the NewCool 1.8 Quart Rubber Hot Water Bottle along with a soft fleece cover. I have included pictures for reference.Water bottles are still popular and a household necessity acoss most of Europe, but have decreased in popularity in the US. The ones I have been able to find are the large, red ones that smell like a tire and the noxious rubber scent makes me feel ill... Who wants to smell that when they're already not feeling well? The NewCool is transparent and has absolutely no scent whatsoever. I've had other bottles of equal quality imported from Germany and I'm quite pleased to have found these on Amazon.The fleece cover is extremely soft, nice to cuddle with and is machine washable. My only complaint is that it is impossible to remove from the bottle for washing. The bottle is easy to fill and can be used with hot, or cold water, depending on the desired use. The cap twists in securely and I have not experienced any leaking. For best results, fill only 2/3 with water.The bottle measures roughly 8x12"" and is the perfect size for adults. It works for children too and I have used it to relieve my daughter's colic symptoms. I fill it only 1/2 full with warm, not hot, water and place it on her belly while I walk with her. The warmth combined with the water sloshing around instantly calms her within minutes everytime.All things considered, I am very pleased with the overall quality, durability, function, ease of use and convenience the water bottle provides. I only wish the cover was removable and for that I am removing a star. Otherwise the bottle is perfect and at 1/4 the cost of those I import from Germany, so I am a happy customer.

"I purchased the HOVEOX Kids Baby Toddler Socks for my infant daughter.

"I received the Cure Ex Fungus Treatment Laser Device to treat stubborn nail fungus I have fought for years. I've tried a variety of medications, homeopathic remedies and even old-wives tales, but nothing worked. That was until I obtained this nifty device. I received the laser treatment, which resembles a pulse-ox meter that would be used at a hospital, or doctors office, along with a convenient charger and an adapter to use in the US.I've been using the device for 7 minutes each day for roughly 10 days now and while my nail fungus isn't totally gone, the results are amazing and it's already better than it has been in 17 years!! The directions state it should be nearly cleared up within 4 weeks, so I'm very impressed with my dramatic results in such a short time and I'm anxious to see what the next couple weeks of treatments will do. I have included both product pictures and before/after images of my nails. The fungus is tinted red from messing with dye that I could not get out of the rough, deep ridges of my nail. Now my nail is wavy, but not flaky and noticeably scared.The device is simple to use and requires no other treatment, lotion, creams, or medications to work. After charging and disconnecting the Cure Ex I place it on the nail needing treatment, turn it off with the convenient single button operation and wait 7 minutes. The time passes quickly while reading, or watching TV. If any other nails have fungus, they must be treated individually for 7 minutes each.I am very pleased with the overall quality, function, ease of use and most importantly, the results the treatment provides.

"I'm new to the world of weight loss shakes and drinkable supplements, but I am enjoying them. My problem is no matter what I do I still have little clumps of the expensive powder that stay in my drink no matter how much I shake my regular cups and it's not like I always have a blender with me.

"I purchased the Mask Bathroom Air Freshener Poop Spray to use in my master bath, which I unfortunately have to share with my stinky husband. I received a 2oz bottle in Santorini Breeze scent, which contains up to 200 uses. I fell in love with this stuff after trying the Moroccan Strawberry, then the Coconut Lime and wanted a variety of anti-stinky for the bathroom. The Santorini Breeze smells masculine and musky, making it a scent both my husband and myself enjoy. I have included product pictures for reference.The scent is pleasant and strong, but not overwhelming. It is potent enough to mask the odors that lurk in the bathroom in the early hours of the morning, which is something no other product I've purchased has been able to do. Other, similar products just add to the stink, leaving me with coconut, or strawberry scented poo, but Mask overcomes even the nastiest of stenches.Unlike other deodorant sprays, Mask is sprayed on the water surface before the toilet is used. My husband simply uses the eco-friendly (wife friendly too!) pump bottle to spray roughly 4 pumps into the toilet bowl to create a thin film on the water. Mask traps the odors and when the potty is flushed it releases the pleasant scent of the bottles contents, instead of the unpleasant scent of my husband's bum.Mask uses the same high quality fragrance oils used in expensive soy candles, instead of harsh chemicals. It's more eco-friendly than aerosol sprays and luckily for my husband, is not flammable. I toss mine in the bathroom drawer closest to the toilet for easy access and it has never leaked thanks to the steel gasket cap. It's constructed to never clog, and to date I have never had problems with any of the scents.All things considered, I am very pleased with the overall quality, function, ease of use, convenience and most importantly, the results Mask Bathroom Air Freshner Poop Spray provides. I know longer have to suffer walking into the bathroom after my husband has used it and we are both much happier.

"I purchased the incredible Mindscope Turbo Twister Light Up LED Stunt RC Remote Control Vehicle for my young son. The patented technology allow the car to spin a full 360* with a rotating front axle and combines with 6 bright, vibrant LED lights to provide the ultimate play experience. I have included product pictures for reference.The car requires 3 AA batteries and the remote uses 2 AA, which are not included, but even with regular use, I have not had to replace them. The remote control is easy enough for my 6 year old to use, but the amazing stunts keep my older children, myself and my husband entertained too.The above mentioned patented technology allows the car to perform stunts that rival name brand toys who make lots of promises, but can't follow through. The Mindscope RC Car definitely holds up to its promises with the car flipping, tumbling, dancing and able to perform wheelies. The LED lights shine through the transparent wheels and echo through the translucency of the orange car body. It is durable and even after several crashes that surely would have broke other, similar toys I have purchased (think flight of concrete stairs...

"I love fairytale retellings and beauty and the beast is really my favorite to read retellings of. This is probably because I love the idea of seeing through the broken beast, to the heart of the man inside. How can you make the retelling even better for me??? Change it up just enough, sprinkle in some witty banter, a cantankerous wizard and some sexy times. Although, you sort of had me at sexy times, I’m easy like that.Entreat Me is a slow burn. It takes a little time to get really going and most of the story is dialogue and character interactions with some real action towards the end.I loved:The lore changes instead of one beast there are two. A father and son cursed by a dying woman. Both trapped in their own ways and in need of a beauty to save them. Louvaen, a widow, comes to the castle to protect the virtue of her sister Cinnia in case the son’s intentions are not honorable making the possibilities of two couples.The Roses they were a living breathing thing that seemed to carry all the hate of the woman who cast the curse in the first place. I liked how the Flux worked and Ballard was scared from his time in the magic ebs and flows like the tides but not truly all beast until the Flux hit.The Sorcerer - his interactions with the household and Louvaen in particular were hilarious. I loved there semi-hatred for each other and how they teased one another.***  Upon her return from Monteblanco, she’d thanked him for not bespelling her off the cliff.  “Keep your thanks,” he told her. “And an eye on your ale. I’m brewing something that turns shrews into toads.”  “While you’re at it, brew something that bestows courtesy and swallow a cup or two yourself,” she shot back. ***The Slow Burn Love Story. It was easy to like Ballard, the man took on the brunt of the curse to free his son from it even though that meant that he would carry most of the scars. The way that Louvaen could see into the man that he was and slowly open up her own heart after losing her husband is the kind of love story that I really love.***  “You can spout honeyed lies better than any court minstrel.”  Her small smile faded when he lifted a hand to cup her cheek.  “No false words, Louvaen. All you have to do is breathe, and you seduce me.” He watched, entranced, as a blush purled up her neck to her face and into her hairline. ***The protection of Cinnia’s Virginity - Gavin took a long time trying to woo Cinnia. I liked that everyone was so worried about what a delicate flower she was and protecting her from knowledge of the curse and its affects. I’m was so glad when that all played out and she was stronger than anyone believed. But it made for some hilarious times as Louvaen made sure that her sister’s maidenhead stayed intact.***  “Lad better quit dawdling and marry the girl, or I’ll kill him before Louvaen does. This is getting bloody tiresome; guarding an uncracked pitcher like it’s the crown jewels.”  Magda chortled. “Best entertainment we’ve had in years, I’m thinking. Those two slinking off for privacy, and your lover flying after them like a hobby on the hunt.”  Ballard shook his head. “Come get me if Gavin returns full of holes.” ***The Humor it was sometimes subtle but it was everywhere. I chuckled to myself so many times throughout the story. I really enjoy the way that Grace Draven weaves her tale and some of the funny things that happen along the way. Like using the enchanted mirror to check on their father only to find him tupping the neighbor and just little gems like this thrown in as well.***  The week prior to her taking to childbed, they had agreed he would choose the name if she bore a boy, and she would choose it if she bore a girl. “I don’t trust you not to call her something silly like Aurora or Buttercup or Snowdrop,” she told him. “And if you named her Briar Rose, I’d have to kill you.” ***The ending of the curse didn’t really go as I thought it would and I actually liked the changes incorporated here. It wasn’t as simple as true loves kiss and I think that that made it all the better.The DrawbacksWell there really weren’t many for me. The beginning is a little slow but I never mind an author taking about 20% to get a good foundation going. And the middle there are quite a few sexy times….but again I enjoyed that part so I really liked it but still not for everyone.The Wrap up and epilogue gave me just enough to keep me satisfied but I always want a little more it seems when I’m really loving a story.Overall:If you like fairytale retellings with sex in them, then I highly recommend The world building and characters were a lot of fun. I still think that I liked Radiance for straight up Romantasy a little better but this is one of my favorite Beauty and The Beast retellings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B9K6C4QDBQ7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEKTLPO#wasThisHelpful","R2B9K6C4QDBQ7J","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate all the characters and want them to die.*** “Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, so she destroyed them all.” ***Okay that is not entirely true….I hate most of the characters and want them to die. But maybe that is how I’m supposed feel. This is pretty dark for YA. All of the main characters have their own ambitions and people who were once friends are now enemies.Usually in a YA story there are good guys and bad guys but in this it seems that everyone is a bad guy. The only truly nice person seems to be Violetta who wants desperately to atone for keeping Adelina’s power at bay when her father tormented her. Everyone else is either power hungry, vengeful, radical or just plain crazy. With that it is really hard to pick a side.I don’t think I was really ready to take a walk on the dark side. Adelina wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows in the Young Elite’s but in The Rose Society she plunges deeper and deeper into her dark side.***  “Fear motivates, more than love or ambition or joy. Fear is more powerful than anything else in the world. I have spent so long yearning for things—for love, for acceptance—that I do not really need. I need nothing except the submission that comes with fear. I do not know why it took me so long to learn this.” ***As the story progresses it is more clear that she is on a really dark path that will probably someday consume her. She is set on becoming Queen and taking all the power to be able to dole out her retribution to those she thinks have wronged her. It is a dark path and the voices in her head don’t make her seem any less crazy.***  “I will do everything in my power to destroy all who stand in my way.” ***Right now I’m not seeing a happy ending for Adelina. Especially with what she did at the end of this and the revelations made about the costs of having Elite powers.Terin at least I understand him. He is the normal bad guy in the story. The man that hates what he is so much that he will destroy all those like him thinking he is doing right and cleansing the world. I always understand his motivations and how love of Julietta has ruined and twisted his mind. He has suffered a pretty severe path in this and I almost feel bad for him. But then I remember all the people he has killed so I guess he really deserved it.Raffaele has a new plan after casting out Adelina and taking what is left of his daggers across the sea. He has made a bargain with Queen Maeve, but is it treason or patriotism. I guess it depends on how you see his role. There is a fine line and Queen Maeve is unlikely to give help that doesn’t benefit her in some way.When you are on the outside looking in and you see all the machinations of everyone involved you see how they are right and wrong at the same time. I wanted parts of Raffaele’s plans to work but at the same time I knew that Adelina’s plans might be better for Enzo’s dreams. Oh and Enzo my poor Enzo just a pawn to be used either by memory or by something else. I don’t know if I should be happy or sad for his fate in this, but I’m pretty certain that this will not go well at all.There are a few new characters that were good additions. Magiano the trickster thief is a fun character to play with although I’m not sure about how I feel about him as a potential love interest (seriously hate potential love triangles). Sergio the boy who controls the rain is also a nice addition to Adelina’s new team of Elites. And Elite’s pitted against other Elites does make for some good fight scenes. Still I hate everyone and think as of now they will all destroy each other in the next book. I do not see a way for a HEA in this series…it is not that kind of book.The huge revelations that came about towards the end were pretty fantastic while I wasn’t ready for the ride this took me on I did like how it concluded. The set up for the next book seems full of tragic possibilities and I’m pretty sure Lu isn’t afraid to kill of a character or five in the finale.I commend Lu for taking a chance and trying something this twisted and dark in a YA format. There isn’t always a clear good guy and bad guy and sometimes the people who win are not the people who should win. And sometimes the people who started out with the best intention become so twisted along the way they are only shadows of who they once were.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318TRG19UOF06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167846#wasThisHelpful","R318TRG19UOF06","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in the voice of Elvira…Because she rocks.So you know me, I know everything that’s goin’ down in Denver. See my girl Mara here comes with some pretty messed up baggage. She’s got some whacked crazy ass point system workin in her head and thinks she is on the low end of that scale. But I’ve seen the girl and she is hot, she’s got curves, she’s got ass, she’s got legs and hot guy, macho man, decorated, squeaky-clean po-lice detective Mitch has noticed. He saw that a long time ago, but couldn’t find a way to get in there.Well…can’t be haven none of that got me a premonition. Woke up and it said ‘you gotta give Mitch a in’ So I did. Shredded her sink washer, got my cousin LaTanya to volunteer Mitch to look at it. You’d think two people watching each other like they do it be enough. But some bitches need a little more push. Sortin' their s*** out is like herdin' cats.Mara got herself some family problems. Seems she has a no good cousin Bill..we all got one in the family. But Mara ain’t so worried about Bill it’s his two kids Billy and Billie because that is the kind of dirt bag loser Bill Winchell is he names his kids the same after him. He’s facin’ a not very happy future that includes a limited wardrobe selection. Mara heart of gold took on Billy and Billie and hot guy po-lice detective Mitch knows this is his shot. Keep Mara safe, keep the kids safe and out of all the crap their daddy got em into and he could have a smokin hot wife, mini-hot-guy and sweet baby girl when all this is over.Watchin all this play out Tellin’ you, girlfriend, this is better than TV.”Real Short Review.Mara drove me nuts in the beginning with hew point system and just how poor her self-esteem was. But once the kids came into the picture I was all in. KA kids always add something great to a story and Billy and Billie were totally adorable.Mitch, well I wanted to read his book from Mystery Man (MM) when Gwen met him. While it took a smidgen of time for the Mitch Lawson of MM to shine through we eventually get him and I loved the patient way he worked with Mara to pull her out of her head and teach her how to find strength within herself. We are not where we come from.The majority of this is a love story, there is a small mystery happening on the side but that is just to add a tendril of suspense or drama to the story and go in for the big finale. I was happy to see a few appearances of Hawk, Brock and Tack there when everything hit the fan at the end along with the Nightingale Men that I haven’t officially met yet (Rock Chic in January).If you have read anything KA you know the drill and the set up. There are some very sexy kisses among other things in this and I liked Mitch and Mara as a couple from the beginning even if she was stubborn and took some convincing. There is also a nice set up going into Tack’s book tying him to the Russian mob so I’m pretty excited to see were that is going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVQCPS5TZCM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455599220#wasThisHelpful","R2QVQCPS5TZCM1","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Short 3.5 Frosted Cupcake StarsI liked Tess - She doesn't play games, puts herself out there and makes great cupcakes. If she would just quit noticing how H.O.T. all the bad guys are that would be great.Brock - gets all the best alpha man speeches, like seriously swoon worthy speeches, and two adorable boys but a crazy ex-wife.Elvira - I want to be in that chicks girl posse because she is HILARIOUS and I loved all the scenes she got to be in. Elvira you can come to my Thanksgiving anytime, although I'm sure it won't be as interesting.Brock's Family - Wow I thought my family had some issues. But this crazy family took the cake so to speak. Full of love and dysfunction and some great moments.The big bad ended up being different than I expected but it was a nice change up and I really enjoyed most of the story. Also the best part was when Tess really kicks some butt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DMBS6SBFYUC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455599204#wasThisHelpful","R3DMBS6SBFYUC1","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.25 Lucky StarsI thought this was going to be the last book in the Ghosts and Reincarnation series but it looks like we will get one more after this about one of the actual ghost hunters sometime which is great because I have had so much fun this this series and I’m happy that we aren’t done yet as each book gets better and better.In any other book you might think Belle is a little scoundrel I mean she was dating one brother only to fall into bed with the other at a family party in a castle. But she is so shy innocent and it was clear from the first few pages that she was dating a man who didn’t understand her at all. So KA does it again breaking some of the boundaries I have set in my head about hands off your brother’s girl and I was totally on board with a Belle/Jack romance from the beginning.***“She won’t mind?” Belle’s sweet voice had grown louder. “She’s your Mum. How could she not mind that I came to her birthday party with one brother and spent the night with the other?”“Belle –” Jack tried to break in but she was struggling again in his arms.“She’s going to think I’m a slut.” Belle’s eyes had left his and she was muttering with agitation as she fought his hold on her. “And rude,” she added and then finished with hilarious melodrama. “Oh my God. She’s going to think I’m rude slut!”***That isn’t to say that they didn’t run into some really big obstacles other than that along the way. Between the sibling rivalry with Jack and Miles, some ghost children living in the castle and Belle’s own past with an abusive husband to get over there is plenty happening.Like most KA books there is a great cast of side characters that add to all of the fun in the story. Belle is so different from her mother, father and grandma that it is hard to think that they come from the same stock. But it did make for some great and funny times.***“Oh my God!” Rachel shouted. “You two have been fooling around!”Belle’s body gave a surprised jerk as she felt Jack’s go solid behind her.Mom wasn’t finished. “You’re fooling around with my daughter while there are ghosts in the house!” she accused Jack as if this was an act akin to rounding up innocent citizens randomly in order to torture them just for kicks.And“She’s mooning over Jack,” Gram informed Mom.“Lots to moon over,” Mom commented. “The man’s got a fantastic behind.”Gram turned from the window, looked at Mom and shared, “I like his hands.”Mom grinned. “Yeah, he’s got great hands. And, from Belle’s look this afternoon, I’m guessing he knows how to use them.”“Mom!” Belle snapped as she walked from the window and threw herself on the bed in front of her mother. She rolled to her back and her mother leaned over her.“It’s just my way of saying I’m happy for you, honeypot.”***The ghost kids….ah they stole my heart a little and I was really happy how that entire story played out and how the curse that tethered them to this plane was done.I’m not sure which book in the Ghosts and Reincarnation series I like the best. I still think Fairytale Come Alive beats this one out by just a smidge but this is definitely the less draining emotionally of the two. Still if you are only going to read a few books in this KA series I don’t think you can go wrong with either Lucky Stars or Fairytale come alive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDELDHL1YCIXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DDW4OQ#wasThisHelpful","RDELDHL1YCIXL","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lazy Review Time - since this came out forever ago and there are a bazillion reviewsThis series has 20+ books in it. I can see what it has been so popular over the years. It is just a good time wrapped up in a ball and transported to the 90s. A time when New Jersey was known for garbage and hydrocarbons and people still had answering machines and no cell phones….YES we used to live like that.Stephanie Plum is a fun character and this was a pretty good introductory book with funny shenanigans as she tries to figure out how to be a bounty hunter. She makes some pretty big mistakes that lead to a little bit of hilarity along the way. She is easy to like and I had a good time hanging out with her as she learns the ropes Eliza Doolittle style from a guy named Ranger that I could help but picture in my head as Dog the Bounty Hunter.A few things I liked:① - The Nostalgia I felt for the 90s② - The hinted at future romantic interest *crosses finger* I really liked Morelli and hope they ‘Play Train’ sooner rather than later.③ - Crazy Shenanigans i.e. hitting the boy who took your virginity and didn’t call with your car a few years later. (don’t worry he was okay)④ - Crazy Grandma’s. I love funny and ridiculous family members so this fit the bill well⑤ - Totally creepy psychopaths. The messed up in the head bad guy is a bit deranged and pretty scary.Definitely and easy fun and funny read with a little drama and suspense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZ6CSLE64EQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312362080#wasThisHelpful","R3LZ6CSLE64EQT","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe I’m finally getting used format of these books or this one is just less confusing and the author has really started to find their stride but FINALLY I feel less like I’m in the mind of someone with severe A.D.D. and more like I’m just in a fast paced story.In the conclusion to this series there are again a lot of subtle cons, twists and unexpected situations and turnabouts happening. Just when you think you know what is going on everything gets blown apart and our heroes have to do a lot to get out of all the trouble that they have now found themselves in.Add to that Desidora’s acceptance of her death priestess powers super cool by the way, Ululenia dealing with her new ‘urges’ since becoming a dark fae and Loch not being as dead as the reports led us to believe and there are even better side stories going on. Favorite character was really a toss-up between Desidora and Ululenia.***As the queen who eats her mate when she has finished with him, Ululenia’s voice rang in Tern’s mind, I am sex and death, desire and destruction. They will die in ecstasy, knowing that I was their fulfillment, my pleasure their end.***Also it seems that her mind boggle has morphed arching ardor, bejeweled bosom, curling caress, decadent desire but I’m gonna say a Unicorn dealing with her evil side is a ton of fun. And then there is Des. I love it every time she starts to channel her death priestess power and things start turning all black and silver.***”How’s Desidora today?”“Her aura isn’t turning all the plants into giant versions of those carnivorous things that eat flies anymore.” Kail smiled.***As always there is Dairy who all honesty and goodness even if he isn’t quite a virgin anymore *wink, wink*. Then Tern and Hessler who are an adorable couple. Icy whose past isn’t even close to what I thought it was and Kail with more your momma jokes in any language than a rap contest. Even his own.***”I’m glad your mother is safe.”“I think I saved the ancients from her more than the other way around,” Kail said, and grinned. “My mom will take anybody who gets up in her face.”Desidora shuddered, and at first Kail thought she was sad, and then cold.After a minute, he realized that she was trying to hold a laugh.“Diz, Diz?”“You,” she gasped, still trying not to laugh, “you say all these things about people’s mothers! And then you say that about yours, and I’m not supposed to think anything?”***The ancients are trying to return with the help of a few soul imbued weapons and Loch and company have to come up with a good way to defeat them. There is also the fact that every elemental deamon they come across is still trying to kill Loch and then there is the specialized assassin team sent by the ancients to help them make their way into the world.Wow things got so crazy in the end and it was amazing and I really enjoyed how everything went down in the finale. This really has been a fun and fast paced series. The Palace Job takes a little getting used to since there were so many characters to meet but once we picked up our team it was great to follow them through all the stories to get her to the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33H08DPLJN7EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503948730#wasThisHelpful","R33H08DPLJN7EL","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my most emotional KA read to date. I really went through the emotional ringer with it I laughed, I cried, I got warm fuzzies that went through my entire body, I cried and did I mention I cried…BUT IT WAS SO WORTH IT!!!Our Story Begins….with young love torn apart.***“When you’re away from him and you realize this is madness, you find me, you call me, you write me, I don’t give a damn what you do.” He leaned into her and took her head in both hands feeling her body go solid when he moved an inch away from her face. His voice dipped low when he continued, “I’ll be pissed off, baby, and I’ll make you work for it. But I love you enough to get over it and take you back. I promise you that.***Prentice thought she’d come back, he was sure of it. Isabella thought he’d come save her from the hell he didn’t know she was living in. But neither of those things happened. Instead Isabella stayed in her hell and let it eat her soul for almost twenty years. Prentice married a nice girl Fiona and had two beautiful children with her until she was stolen away from them too soon and left him widowed and broken. But then Isabella to Scotland comes for her best friend’s wedding and….That is really all I want to tell you about the set up. Seriously because I really didn’t know much going into this read and it was wonderful to let the story wash over me. The heartache of all the characters and how each one was able to fix a small piece of the other. It was all heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.Elle is so broken and it was heartbreaking to see how she was a good person but had been kicked so many times that she believed she did Prentice a favor by leaving his life. Prentice had a hard enough time putting his life together after losing his wife let alone figuring out how to help his children. There are so many great scenes where Elle was able to find a way to help the kids and Prentice.I love the way that a cute little six year old girl called her Mrs. Evangahlala because she couldn’t say Evangalista and how Elle was able to help a confused boy remember his mother without feeling bad about it and giving into the painful side.***“You know, she’s with you every minute. Here,” she tugged his hair gently.“Here,” she let his hair go and tapped his head with her finger.“And here,” she put her hand over his heart.“I learned that a long time ago,” Bella whispered. “My Mom left me but she left a lot with me and all of it I carry safe, every moment, right here,” she pressed her hand on his chest for emphasis and Jason closed his eyes.***I loved watching how Pren and Elle found their way back to each other. Yes some of it was really difficult, painful and hard but it was totally worth the journey and the pay-off was HUGE.What I didn’t expect were the PoVs from the dead wife Fiona as a ghost as she tries to help Elle find a way into her family to help them be happy. Those were bittersweet as she want the best for her family in order for her to be able to move on but at the same time it is difficult to also give them up to someone else.But for as much intensity as there was with the heaviness of the situation, there were also plenty of funny moments to offset it.***“Elle,” he cut in, “are you with Annie?”Bella’s shoulders went straight and she snapped, “Yes, and would you stop asking if I’m with Anniewhen you think we’re misbehaving?”“Oh crap,” Annie mumbled in the background. Prentice obviously didn’t appreciate her tone of voice and Fiona knew this by his tone of voice when he answered.“Were you with Annie two weeks ago when the police pulled you over for drag racing?” he countered.***Overall: This is one of my favorite KA reads. It is less alpha craziness than many of her stories and there are so many great moments that I’d love to share but I’d also like them to be a surprise when you get to them in the story. This is book 4 of the Ghosts and Reincarnation Series BUT….it can totally be read as a standalone if you don’t want to commit to anything else. Love It, Love It, Love It.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AU3Q9QLEKCV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006C4AFSA#wasThisHelpful","R3AU3Q9QLEKCV2","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story of reincarnated lovers and curses. You would think that once you meet your reincarnated love it would be smooth sailing right. But if some of the blood of your killer was used in the binding of the spell to bring you back together years later…well that might cause a few hiccups to work through.This is a blend of sweet and sour. Colin has been told his entire life that he is the exact image of his long dead relative Royce and he knew all of the stories surrounding the lovers killed on the day of their wedding destined to return to this world someday. He even believed in them for a time but he lost all hope of that a long time ago.***For Colin Morgan had been born with a broken heart, the broken heart of a long-dead warrior, a warrior who lost his love and his life at near the same exact time.***Sibyl has mostly lived with her head in the clouds for most of her life. She has dreams of finding the one man that she is sure is supposed to fit into her life. She has even had dreams/premonitions of him. But when both Colin and Sibyl meet what should have been easy turns into a fiasco of epic proportions.***Strangely, and distressingly, she felt like she’d been in this exact position before, facing off against him. And losing. This feeling was not a little familiar, but a lot, like it didn’t happen once but repeatedly. And it was bizarre, frightening and, lastly, bizarrely, frighteningly reassuring.***Colin is convinced that Sibyl is a con artist just out for his money and she is pretty sure he is slightly deranged. As they stumble and fall together in some weird twisted and possible slightly cruel ways each starts to open up a little to the other and the closer they get to each other the more danger they are in because history it seems it doomed to repeat itself and they didn’t make it out alive 500 years ago.***The dark soul stood hidden in the trees and watched the cottage. The soul saw the flash of movement as the body came flying to the window, a woman’s body, a woman with unforgettable hair. Then a man come to her to hold her, gently, carefully, as if the naked woman was an exquisite, fragile piece of priceless crystal.At this sight, the dark soul seethed.***I like Sibyl and Colin enough…their story is a bit contrived but it is KA and most of the time I just go with it since ultimately I like the journey she takes me on. Sibyl has a temper and seems to take responsibility for things that she has no control over. Colin is bossy, single minded and a bit emotionally detached in the beginning. It really takes a while for their relationship to shift from suspicion, distrust and smexy times to compassion, caring and smexy times…but don’t forget the smexy times because there is a lot of that.KA writes families pretty well, it is one of my favorite things about her writing the dynamics she uses between her side characters. Sometimes they are my favorite part of the story. I definitely loved Sibyl’s family and her mom especially cracked me up.***“We aren’t going to see Colin until Wednesday, you’re surely not going to allow him to leave town without an uninterrupted evening of privacy, are you?”Sibyl clamped her mouth shut.“Give her a good tumble, Colin,” Mags urged audaciously, pushing a stiff-with-humiliated-fury Sibyl out the door ahead of Colin. “She’ll need it to keep her in good spirits for the next couple of days.”***And I thought my mother had boundary issues. Still I enjoyed the way it felt pretty natural in the overall story.I will say the culmination at the end was really my favorite part. Shift between now and then seeing who/what else was reincarnated and helping out with this story.***Mallory pulled out of his early evening nap, got to his feet far more gracefully than he had ever done in his whole doggie life and he walked into the house, following the last person of the party to enter as they all went in to escape the oncoming storm. He walked directly to his master and mistress’s bedroom and sat properly, not lounged, at the door. And thus he stood sentry.* * * * * It wasn’t just people who were reincarnated, you know***For me the ending was intense and I really loved it all jumping between here and there, this and that with all the little added in snippets it built well.The epilogue totally killed me and that is why I love KA books because no matter what else happens I get so caught up in them that my emotions sway easily and she can pull me to the verge of tears either in happiness or sadness in an instant. But the epilogue was definitely happiness for sure.Warning: As always KA is not for everyone. She seems to be a love her or hate her sort of author. I’m an emotional reader so she usually works for me because she always takes my emotions on a journey. But if you are more on the side of a thinking reader than she might drive you bonkers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208QQXU61T4PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G7SUL8#wasThisHelpful","R208QQXU61T4PT","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 The House Doesn't Like Strangers StarsHave you ever walked into a house or room and it has a ‘feel’ about it? Whether it is good or bad there is just something that surrounds you and makes your emotions shift a certain way. Well Sommersgate house has that definite feel to it to all those who live there and it is unmistakable what the house is feeling.Worst of all, the house was tense and make no mistake about it, even though it was simply mortar and stone (albeit grand mortar and stone), Sommersgate could most definitely be tense.The house it seems is haunted by two lovers who were killed shortly after they were married and a horrific way and over the years they are made to relive their deaths time and time again. The curse will only be broken when the master of the house finds true love. But that it seems is hard to come by and so hundreds of years have passed.While I was immediately drawn into the first book of this series, this one takes some time. The beginning is a little slow at it is being set up and I will say that this is one of the few times I’ve felt like KA is guilty of info dumping. But, once we get the first few chapters in everything starts to pick-up.Douglas it seems is a broken man and a man of mystery. No one seems to know what he does, he is gone most of the time and once disappeared for two years. Julia had a bad marriage that totally broke her confidence and she hasn’t trusted a man since. When both her husband and father basically abandoned her she decided that she would never let someone that close again…then her brother died.Julia and Douglas are thrown together to raise the two children left behind when their parents died. It was Douglas’s sister Tamsin’s last wish that he and Julia raise the children together at Sommersgate. It is quickly clear that they are clashing over what each expects from the other and Douglas isn’t used to anyone standing up against him let alone a beautiful woman…..so let the sparks fly.“As for Tamsin’s wishes, I intend to carry them out to the letter. There was a reason she wanted you here, you and your delectable body and your enticing perfume and your legs that go on forever.”She was stunned by his words and could barely process them before he went on.“My sister was a romantic and she cared for us both. She had very specific intentions for this little arrangement she created and I’ve no doubt she talked Gavin around to her way of thinking.”The story might start out a little slow but that is the feel of coming into a house of morning and trying to bring back 3 children from the depths of despair that is left when both of your parents die. I loved the tender moments that we get as this family starts to put themselves back together. Sometimes it was so incredibly heartbreaking as each child comes to terms with it in different ways.Douglas is bound and determined that Julia will be his wife and they will raise the children together. But Julia after her horrendous last marriage keeps putting him off and saying no. Seriously even I was starting to get more and more disgruntled with her reluctance because it was taking sooo long. Douglas was definitely playing the long game on this one.Clearly, Douglas realised what Julia had officially termed (in her own mind) “The Tender Onslaught Strategy (with Vague Tendencies Toward Arrogance)” was working beautifully so he kept right on using it.Overall though this is one of the more drawn out of KA’s love stories and loved all the small gestures that Douglas makes not only with Julia but also with the children as he learns how to love a family and receive their love in return.There are always some hiccups along the way and the culmination of the story that will release the ghosts was interesting and really good. But for me one of the best parts of the story was the epilogue that gave little snippets of what all the characters did in the future. It was so interesting to see what sort of future they all had.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q20BO6SJHLHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056ZAJSC#wasThisHelpful","R1Q20BO6SJHLHJ","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 Flashbacks LOST style StarsIs Six of Crows a heist book? The answer is Yes but not really in the conventional way I look at a heist books. I really want to say that this is a perfect blending of Ocean’s Eleven trickery and LOST style flashbacks. Which for me is great since it gave me a clear idea of who each character was and their motivations. But that also means that most of the action is in the second half of the book. Not to say I wasn’t entertained in the first half, I was, I’m saying in the first half I had time to set the book down and make updates to all my Goodread’s friends and in the second half I did not.A few good things:1 - You do not have to have read the original Grisha Trilogy to read this book. There are some thrown in easter eggs and such for those who have but it isn’t necessary at all.2 - Complex Characters…they are everywhere and LB describes them beautifully. Of the six members of the Dregg’s crew four get the most attention and damn I loved every one of them for different reasons.Inej - The Wraith and Spymaster***That she was so very good at remaining unseen made her an excellent thief of secrets, the best in the Barrel. But the fact that she could simply erase herself bothered him. She didn’t even have a scent. All people carried scents, and those scents told stories—the hint of carbolic on a woman’s fingers or woodsmoke in her hair, the wet wool of a man’s suit, or the tinge of gunpowder lingering in his shirt cuffs. But not Inej. She’d somehow mastered invisibility.***Kaz - Dirty Hands the Thief and Magician of Sorts***""You’re a blackmailer—”“I broker information.”“A con artist—”“I create opportunity.”“A bawd and a murderer—”“I don’t run whores, and I kill for a cause.”“And what cause is that?”“Same as yours, merch. Profit.”***Matthias and Nina - Convict and the Grisha who is his distraction and destruction***In all his dreams he hunted her, sometimes through the new green meadows of spring, but usually through the ice fields, dodging boulders and crevasses with unerring steps. Always he chased, and always he caught her. In the good dreams, he slammed her to the ground and throttled her, watching the life drain from her eyes, heart full of vengeance—finally, finally. In the bad dreams, he kissed her.***3 - Worldbuilding. There wasn’t really a ton of it in the original Grisha trilogy but LB has put much more into the land, culture and structure of this world.4 - The flashbacks…I LOVE THEM. I loved getting glimpses into the pasts of the crew to see how they ended up in prison, a brothel, leader of a gang etc. and what the driving forces are to the people they have become. The major events that shaped them gave complexity and depth to the decisions each made.5 - The friendships. They might be deadly and tricky but to one another they would walk into hell and back, even if they don’t know it yet.***“I don’t know what your excuse is, Wraith. I’m the one who can never walk away from a bad hand.”She looped her arm in his. “That makes you a rotten gambler, Jesper. But an excellent friend.”***6 - THIS IS A DUET! LB doesn’t really like the term Dualogy but put simple that means there are two books to complete the story with this cast of characters. Six of Crows being the heist and the next one being a long con. THANK YOU! There are so many trilogies out there that I really think could have been summed up in one great book instead of three ho/hum ones. Two books is perfect sometimes and I wish more authors/publishers would use that format.7 - The first half of the books is a lot of getting to know the people in the story and why they are going to be great at this. But the second half is a mad dash at times with way more Boom Boom Pow Pow WTF OMG and ahhhhhh moments. Not exactly in that order.8 - Ships I want to jump on. While this isn’t really a romance book there is a clear indication that there might be hope for three couples to come out of this series (if they all live that is) and I SHIP THEM ALL. Plus no love triangle, thank god. But don’t be confused it is super on the back burner as they have to sneak into a fortress of sorts and rescue a scientist. Not a lot of time for any kissy kissy. But still I love all the slow burn potential there.***“Kaz is … I don’t know, he’s like nobody else I’ve ever known. He surprises me.”“Yes. Like a hive of bees in your dresser drawer.”Jesper barked a laugh.“Just like that.”“So what are we doing here?”Jesper turned back to the sea, feeling his cheeks heat. “Hoping for honey, I guess. And praying not to get stung.”Inej bumped her shoulder against his. “Then at least we’re both the same kind of stupid.”AND“Jer molle pe oonet. Enel mörd je nej afva trohem verret.”***I love this line so much but you will have to read the book for the translations…mewwahhahaha9 - The Plot…I love a good heist story so and this one has enough twist, turns and bad guys to keep you guessing. But the short of it is Kaz and crew are offered a lot of money to break into an impenetrable fortress to rescue a scientist who can make a super drug. Each member of Kaz’s team is going for a different reason and not all of them agree. But it is certain that if caught they will all die.10 - It’s so pretty. Seriously I don’t buy a lot of hardcover books (I live for ebooks and audio) but this is one of the most beautiful books I’ve seen and well worth getting the hardcover. Also just to note the audio was really good. There are 7 yes you saw that right 7 narrators. One for each PoV and they are all so good. They gave each voice a really distinctive tone and each one was done so well. I’m totally partial to Matthias’s PoV though because Jay Snyder is the bomb.A few bad things:There aren’t many but just a couple things of note. Since the first half has the majority of the character development it might feel a little slow if you just wanted chases and things blowing up. Nothing really for the heist starts to happen until the halfway point. Not a big issue for me but I’m letting you know anyway.The Grisha aren’t explained really well. Maybe I only think that because I read the original trilogy. I think if you haven’t read the Grisha Trilogy you will totally be fine, but maybe since I know many more Grisha things I was looking for just a little more in this area.Also there is a little bit of a cliffy at the end. I’m not saying it is so cliffy that you will want to pull all your hair out waiting for the next book maybe just a few strands. The epilogue made me desperate to find out what Kaz has planned because Dirty Hands has come to play and I really want to see how dirty he can get.But seriously I’m totally nitpicking here. I very much enjoyed this book and really can’t wait for the sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NE1Y8YTN5IXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792120#wasThisHelpful","R2NE1Y8YTN5IXH","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really ready not to like this book. I was totally loving St. Vincent in the last one until….well you know what he did.***“He didn’t seem to take it well, my borrowing of his betrothed.”“You k-kidnapped her,” Evangeline countered calmly. “‘Borrowing’ implies that you intended to give her back.”***But it seems that our little stammering Evie is just as desperate if not even more so than St. Vincent and needs a husband quick. Evie has way more strength and gumption than I had initially thought. Who knew that behind that little stammer and shy faade was someone so stubborn, determined and strong. I mean not just anyone can take on the dastardly rake St. Vincent is.***“It’s not a love match. It’s a marriage of convenience, and there’s not enough warmth between us to light a birthday candle. Get on with it, if you please. Neither of us has had a proper sleep in two days.”Silence fell over the scene, with MacPhee and his two daughters appearing shocked by the brusque remarks. Then the blacksmith’s heavy brows lowered over his eyes in a scowl. “I don’t like ye,” he announced.St. Vincent regarded him with exasperation. “Neither does my bride-to-be. But since that’s not going to stop her from marrying me, it shouldn’t stop you either. Go on.”***I’ll admit I couldn’t hold my grudge and distain for St Vincent. I grew to like him again quite soon as I’m thrown with Evie into their marriage of convenience. What is it with Jerky guys that are so broken you just want to fix them? Also it was quite obvious from very early that St. Vincent did care a lot for Evie, even though he never knew how to say the words he showed her with all of his deeds. But Evie oh our girl has been treated badly with words and deeds by her family for as long as she can remember and finally she feels comfortable and safe enough with someone to fight back with them.***“At the moment you’re too much of a novice to be worth the bother,” he continued coolly. “Perhaps I’ll seduce you in the future, after some other men have taken the trouble to educate you.”“I doubt it,” she said sullenly. “I would never be so bourgeois as to sleep with my own husband.”A catch of laughter escaped him. “My God. You must have been waiting for days to use that one. Congratulations, child. We haven’t yet been married a week, and you’re already learning how to fight.”***Evie was sure that after the marriage and initial consummation he would be ready to be rid of her. However, instead of just taking the money and moving on Evie’s challenges have made him want to rise to the occasion and turn her father’s club into something great again. He just has some growing to do and maybe with the help of Cam (who is totally adorable by the way) he might just learn a few things.***“You fault me for having standards?” Sebastian countered icily.“Not at all. I fault you for having two sets of them. The Rom have a saying—‘With one behind, you cannot sit on two horses.’***I enjoyed the growth of Sebastian St. Vincent and I loved how Evie really came into her own away from her dreadful family. The danger felt pretty real and the way it brought the couple closer together was so much fun and what I really love in Historical Romances.Another fun read in the Wallflowers series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1CE87Y714IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006056251X#wasThisHelpful","RL1CE87Y714IW","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fan book. Have you read the rest of the series and the short stories??? Well then Wickedly Ever After answers the questions what happened to everyone after… But if you haven’t read the rest of the series I believe you will be extremely bored and trying to figure out what the heck is going on.The best part is that we get to journey through Sang again and see Letitia’s transformation from human to a Bludman. We get to see Criminy and go on another journey with them getting cameo’s from every other important character from the other books along the way. I enjoyed seeing everyone, even if it didn’t seem likely that some of them should be in the area.The bad news is I was a little annoyed with Letitia and her Grandmother. Also the plot wasn’t as good as some others in the series. Grandma/Ruby gets a second chance at life in Sang. Tish thought they would stay together and things would be exactly the same except her grandma would be younger and hot. Grandma has different plans and has run away from the Clockwork Circus to the city to deal with the Witch who made it possible for Letitia and Ruby to even be in Sang.I wasn’t a huge fan of how the family drama started out and how both Letitia and her grandmother acted. The only person I really enjoyed the first half of the story was Criminy. At least by the second half of the story it all became more interesting and I did enjoy the story more.The best part though if you are a fan of the series is the cute epilogue at the end with how everyone’s happily ever after’s went. I liked seeing Criminy and Tish long with all the other couples 10 years later and how their lives turned out.If you’ve read all the rest of the books and novella’s in the series then you might as well finish up Tish’s journey into becoming a full Bludwoman and breaking free from the Witch’s pull over her and Criminy. If you have only read one or two books in this series then you might want to skip it at this time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFH6XOQW2RX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQP0O#wasThisHelpful","RPFH6XOQW2RX9","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Quick Rundown is it is the Wallflowers turn to help Lillian find a husband and what better place to start looking than at Westcliff’s estate. They have been invited to the country estate because Westcliff is doing business with Lillian’s father. It seems that even though Westcliff is bound and determined to do his duty and find a nice English girl to settle down with someday he can’t get the often crass and willful American out of his head. Every time he gets close to her his senses disappear and they are either fighting or kissing. She doesn’t seem to understand it any more than she does. But when another man enters the fray and vies for Lillian’s dowery/affections Marcus will have to step up or step aside.The things that I enjoy about this series so far are:They are quick and easy HEA reads. The plots are pretty simple with most of the focus being on the budding relationship between two people who seem an unlikely pairing in the beginning until it is realized they are perfect for one another. It is always fun to read a couple trying to force themselves apart when it seems they have magnets pulling them together. And as always be careful what you wish for.Lillian murmured, though she wasn’t precisely hoping for Lord Westcliff to find true love. Her wish was more along the lines of, I hope that Lord Westcliff will meet a woman who will bring him to his kneesI enjoy the banter between all the characters and especially the special relationships between the four Wallflowers themselves. Female friends who stand by you no matter is going on is one of my favorite things in books.This had the added rakishness that is St. Vincent as well. He actually got to have the best lines in the book and I was so excited to see he was the love interest in the next book, until I wasn’t (view spoiler). Still his actions prior to the thing were so great I really loved his character.***“Am I in danger from you, my lord?”Though his expression remained relaxed with good humor, his eyes were disturbingly intent. “I’m afraid so.”“Hmm.” Lillian studied the chiseled edge of his profile, thinking that for all his posturing, he had not taken advantage of her helplessness a few moments ago. “You’re awfully forthcoming about your evil intentions. It makes me wonder if I should really worry.”***O.o you should be worried. St. Vincent is charming and handsome and I could see why so many woman had fallen for his charms he was definitely solid competition.The couplings have been really good so far. Marcus Westcliff and Lillian do make sense together and they both have strong personalities that clash spectacularly at times. He is so starched and uptight while she is wild and adventurous. But they get some fun scenes together. There is a drunken Lillian in the library with a pear in a bottle predicament that was particularly funny among others.I had a good time with Westcliff and Lillian. I really enjoyed how much he was looking forward to telling his mother about their upcoming betrothal***“And I would like to hear what the countess will say when she is told that you intend to bring yet one more American into the family!”“She’ll have an apoplectic fit,” Marcus replied calmly, tying her corset laces. “She’ll go on a screaming tirade, at the end of which she’ll probably faint. And then she’ll go to the continent for six months, and refuse to write to any of us.” Pausing, he added with relish, “How I’m looking forward to it.”***So solid characters, humor, romance and HEAs sometimes that is all a girl needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGX388G11JGES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKERC#wasThisHelpful","RGX388G11JGES","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The prophecy Con is full of interesting characters, weird magic, different lore and a whole host of craziness. It has a very interesting story and I like it but…..due to the jumping PoVs and the sheer number of things happening at the same time sometimes it is hard for me to become really invested in the story. I get a little OCD with fantasy books wanting to understand the world and the magic and sometimes I struggle with this particular series as it brushes on the magic but I never really understand it. I like to equate this to an A.D.D. persons dream book since it is so jumpy.Still there are plenty of entertaining moments with:Kail always insulting your mother in a fight“Wait, were you just trying to get us to take everything off?” Kail asked, winking at one of the guards and moving to force eye contact in return. “Man, your mother is so much more polite about it.”Dairy’s unexpected continued virginity“Are you really certain that you don’t find Ululenia attractive?” Hessler asked. “Maybe it was first-time jitters. I mean, as far as I can tell, she is arrogant apple, babbling brook, creeping cat, all right, I’m stopping!” He glared at Ululenia. “There was no need to resort to cluttering up my mind.”“I disagree strongly.” Ululenia’s horn flared, and she headed back toward the office, her slim hips swaying in her white dress with every step.“You’re . . . you’re sure?” Hessler said. “Because while I am by no means a paragon of masculine attitudes . . . you don’t get many chances at something like that.“I’m sure.” Dairy looked at Ululenia, then Hessler. “I thought you were with Tern, Mister Hessler.”“Well, yes, but I’m not dead.”Tern and Hessler’s new relationship…it is a bit cute. Kail and Desidora’s complicated dance of something and Loch and Pyvic figuring out how to juggle their sometimes conflicting jobs with their relationship.There is quick wit everywhere“Can you go any faster?” Pyvic asked.“Yes, I’m just choosing to go this speed because your mother likes it when I take my time!”&“There’s not a lot to hold onto up on top.”“A lesser man,” Icy said, “would find a way to reference your mother in response to that sentence.”So with all that awesomeness you might say “Why Robin did you only give it 3 stars? Well my friends the answer is that after I set this book down I sometimes have no idea what the point of what I just read was. I finished this a few days ago and totally forgot what the direction of the entire story was and had to go back through my notes to refigure out the plot.The Plot…I think.To avoid war between the Republic and the Empire (seriously I have flashbacks to Star Wars every time I see republic and empire used in this book) Loch must steal back the Elfin book that she gave the elves so they would save the floating city in The Palace Job. Why do they need the Elfin book, that is a little unclear, there may be a prophecy in the book that could bring the ancients back or the glimmering folk. So Loch and team devise a plan and prepare to steal the book back. However along the way they are chased by A Grundle of foes. Not only do they have an Imperial Princess and her body guards tracking them, there are some Knights, the Justicars and apparently Demons as well. Sufficed to say there really isn’t much down time. Something is regularly blowing up or fighting breaks out.I will say that there isn’t much down time in this book. Something is almost always happening and just when our characters have broken free from one death defying event then another happens. It is a fun ride with quippy banter, action action action and an unexpected ending. Really I didn’t see that coming at the end. Still not my favorite fantasy series because, details I love them and sometimes I felt like I didn’t understand this world or it’s magic. However I do like the characters so it will be interesting to see how the final book plays out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THAA2UYZ0M8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477824715#wasThisHelpful","R3THAA2UYZ0M8P","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 Make Your Own Fate StarsWallflowers Binge Read.So many of my friends love this series so here we go….First I love the premise of this series as I’m sure that had I been alive at the time and in this culture more than likely I would have been a Wallflower. Four girls unite to help each other land husbands as something is undesirable about each of them to the gentry. I love stories that involve strong friendships between women that show them in a good light helping one another and not being caddy, jealous or vindictive.“I'm coming to believe that there are two kinds of people... those who choose to be masters of their own fate and those who wait in chairs while other dance. I would rather be one of the former than the latter.”Annabelle has just made three friends who have decided to help her land a husband. She is a beautiful girl with a name but no money to accompany it and has had no luck finding a husband in three seasons. This is her last chance and the vultures are circling already. If she can’t find a husband there are men who are ready to take her on as a mistress and due to her family’s financial state she might not have a choice.Her final hope comes in an invitation to Lord Westcliff’s estate where there will be a few bachelors in attendance that might fit her needs if she can capture the attention of one. It seems that Annabelle has caught the attention of a rich man but Mr. Hunt but he isn’t part of the Gentry and made all his money working *gasps*. He might fit the financial needs of Annabelle’s plight but he certainly doesn’t fit the idea of who she needs to marry.Mr. Hunt has always enjoyed his verbal sparring with Annabelle and while he won’t interfere with her endeavors to land an acceptable husband, he too is ready to jump in and have her become his mistress after this season fails for surely he is not the marrying kind *snickers*. But the more time that he spends with her the less he seems to believe that he could ever be parted from her. Now if he could just convince her of that too.“Where are we going?” Annabelle asked, resisting his hold on her wrist.“To the house. If they’re not willing to be witnesses, then it seems I’ll have to debauch you in front of someone else.”I enjoyed the story and how if played out. The building care that Hunt had for Annabelle and the time they spent together. There is a bit of a slow portion after the marriage (come on we all knew it was going there right) but before the galvanizing tragic event that solidifies them. But overall this was a fun HR read that had some great funny dialogue and silly laughable moments in it.Favorite Scenes✿ - Getting caught playing Rounders in their knickers.❀ - Playing chess in sitting room✿ - The Dance, to her favorite waltz❀ - The BOOTS, who knew I could be so excited about a man giving a lady some boots.✿ - AND OF COURSE the ‘I don’t want to live without you scene’ at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TO9CWUE4NGHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2KJ2#wasThisHelpful","R3TO9CWUE4NGHX","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Life is made of so many moments that mean nothing. Then one day, a single moment comes along to define every second that comes after.***I wasn’t going to read this book. I’d seen some varied reviews from friends and thought that it probably was going to have some of those YA trope in it that haven’t been working for me lately. But then I saw that Steve West was the narrator and I have a huge crush on that man’s voice so I broke down and gave it a try.The Good- There is the obvious benefit of Steve West being a fantastic narrator and audiobook performer. Fiona Hardingham also does a beautiful job but I’m not dreaming of having her read me stories before bed like I do with Steve I’m not stalking him I promise…mostly- Dual PoV switching between Elias and Laia. It made the story progress a little better than it could have and was able to show two very separate and distinctive classes within the society. Also I didn’t really like most of Laia’s early chapters so it was nice to shift out of her story- The competition to become Emperor. Yes competition tropes in YA are EVERYWHERE and I love them. There is a reason why The Goblet of Fire was my favorite Harry Potter book. But it really worked well in Elias’s story line.***Only the greatest of our graduates are worthy, the strongest. Only four. Of these four Aspirants, one will be named the Foretold. One will swear fealty and serve as the Blood Shrike. The others will be lost, as leaves on the wind. This, too, we have seen.”***He and best friend Helene are set to compete against each other and two of the meanest, deadliest soldiers to come out of their class.- The Jinn mythology. It isn’t overused in YA yet and was a different and interesting addition of magic and potential mayhem to the story. There wasn’t a lot of it, but I’m hoping that in the next book we will see more of the jinn and efrits, ghuls and wraiths.- The Commandant…we always need a bad guy/girl and she plays the part well if not a little crazily. She is the only female Mask and she is definitely the most deadly foe out there.***“She’ll punish me. Maybe kill me. I know. But she might do that anyway if I forget to dust her room or if I look her in the eye. Living with the Commandant is like living with the Reaper***- The Semi/Love Square – I know you are saying ’But Robin you hate love triangles’ and you are right I do. But this is the thing I liked about this particular set up. All the characters are pretty young. They are in some perilous situations and it isn’t like anyone is declaring undying devotion to anyone. Mostly it is flirting sorta feeling out your hormones and options. That click when you see someone you are attracted to and you end up looking at them or looking for them in the crowd. When it is all just possibility still and you are feeling out your options. There is only one person IN LOVE and it is a bit believable as she has been his friend most of her life. How do you know that the kiss you shared with one boy was the end all be all of kisses IF you’ve never kissed anyone else to compare it to? Had it been a better written romance where I felt like two of the people were destined to be together it might have bugged me…but as it was I liked how all the sides of the square worked out in the end.(view spoiler)- IZZI she was my favorite side character besides the kick butt Helene. Izzi has lived as a slave most of her life and has a missing eye from one of the Commandants punishments. But she is still a kind soul in a horrible place and I just wanted to hug her and keep her safe. I was so happy that she has a secret friendship with Laia. She was really just adorable. I loved that with all she has been through she is still such a loving person.***“Izzi.” I touch her arm. “I’m sorry. If I’d known about the raid, I never—”“Are you joking?” Izzi says. Her eye darts to Veturius standing behind me, and she smiles, a blaze of white that startles me with its beauty. “I wouldn’t have traded this for anything.”***The Bad- Oh Laia I hated you for ~ 2/3rds of the book. She is a bit whiny, a victim and extremely naïve. I do get that her character had the most to grow and go through but she really didn’t grow on me for a long time.- The rapey and brutal culture of living with the Commandant or even in the school. I get it that in the culture it would be seen as nothing to beat or rape the servant girls. Still I’m not a huge fan when this is overused in YA and honestly if I had a child under the age of 15-16 I wouldn’t necessarily want them to read it. It was brought up a lot and everyone just acted okay with it. Even Helene thought it was a normal part of life for her classmates to sometimes rape the help.- Marcus is flat as a villain. How do we make him horrible? We make him say nasty rapey things to all the women and be a cheat looking for an easy way to kill off the competition. He was pretty two dimensional and it made him just the bad guy. But not the bad guy with his own motivations besides being bad. At least the Commandant was a little more complex. You weren’t quite sure why she hates her son so much (view spoiler) but I think she has some complex reasons. And she disfigures the attractive girls that work for her but I couldn’t decide if she thought she was helping them by being less attractive to the male students and less likely to be raped or just because she is crazy…still hard to say.- The first half really dragged. Seriously, if I were to base my rating on the first half of the book it would most likely be a 1.5 stars. Laia made all kinds of mistakes and kept telling me how useless she was. Well yes I believed her. I’m glad she toughened up by the second half.- I really wanted just a little more magic or stuff with the tribes to be introduced since to me that was one of the more interesting aspects to the story. Hopefully the next book will have a little more of that included.OverallBy the end An Ember in the Ashes had a lot of potential going into the next book of the series, it just took a while to get there. There are some standard YA tropes but I’m giving a pass to most. If you have a younger reader some of the material in this is maybe to adult for the 12-14 ranges. The last quarter of the book was very good and I hope the next book can pick up and maintain that momentum.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAUDYT8Y4MZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595148035#wasThisHelpful","R2TAUDYT8Y4MZR","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*****  Once upon a time a Mollusk and an Eel fell in love….  ******Okay so it isn’t quite that. Ildiko and Brishen are two people who are insignificant to their families. They both have always known that they would be used by their families in order to form alliances. They just didn’t realize that they would be forced to marry outside their race to do it. Ildiko thinks that Brishen looks a little like and Eel and he believes her to look a bit like a Mollusk. Still it could be worse.****  “You don’t have to answer of course, but do you think the Kai prince will hate his wife?”  ….  “I think the prince expected to marry a Kai noblewoman and father children one day. He never imagined an arranged marriage with a human woman to seal a war and trade alliance between Bast-Haradis and Gaur. He might resent the circumstances thrust upon him, but I doubt he’ll bear any ill will toward his future wife. She’s as much a pawn in this as he is.” Brishen frowned. “Unless the bride is a foul-tempered harpy.” ****That statement is one reason I LOVED this book. This isn’t the marriage Brishen really wanted but instead of being a jerk to his new bride he accepts that they are in this together for better or worse and it would be more advantageous to make a friend of his new wife. They start out with a unique friendship and that simmers and grows until each sees the beauty of the other in a different way. <--I love stories like this.If that wasn’t enough there is also the danger of Brishen’s own mother, warring kingdoms and magic. I’m not sure what scared me more the raiders or Brishen’s mother. She is a fantastic evil creature and a bit creepy too.****  “Your mother is...”  “A soulless creature with a thirst for murder and an intellect greater than any other in the kingdom.” Brishen poured wine for himself in another goblet. “It makes her a ruler unmatched in both malice and strategy. My father would have been overthrown decades ago without her by his side.” *****Shivers* she is disturbing.Ildiko was a fantastic female character. She is forced to marry someone she finds visually repugnant and leave her home and her race to go live in a new land. But she doesn’t wallow or complain she takes it all in stride and make the best out of the circumstances given to her. She becomes an ally to Brishen and tries to be the best wife possible to him.A few of my favorite moments:❀ - Meeting the Queen for the first time and trading barbs.❀❀ - The moving pie (yuck)/ or the potato incident❀❀❀ - The meet cute in the garden❀❀❀❀ - Actually getting down to the nitty gritty *wink wink* bow-chicka-wow-wow❀❀❀❀❀ - And the complete Awe moment….(view spoiler) *happy sigh*BUT THAT ENDING…..I wasn’t expecting it. The epilogue came out of nowhere and WOW. My jaw was on the floor and now I have to wait a year for the next book. I’m so ready and I have found a few friends to hold my hand because it looks like it might be a bumpy ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9LCG5XSIYWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506119719#wasThisHelpful","R1R9LCG5XSIYWR","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Martian is what happens when you put a team of nerd in a room together and posed the question “What’s the worst that would happen if a man was stuck on mars?” Or at least in my head that is how this story was created.I can’t read much Sci-Fi because unless it is super futuristic or farfetched I usually nit-pick it apart. But The Martian is refreshing in that either I was so entertained by the story I didn’t notice or the science seemed spot on enough that there wasn’t really anything to get uber nit-picky about. Plus the entire time I was reading/listening because the audio for this is awesome I was thinking how this is going to look on a big screen and I believe it will be supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.The SkinnyMark Watney is left on mars and presumed dead…except he isn’t and now he has to figure out how to stay alive, let earth know he is alive and possibly be rescued. It is a tall order as it is MARS and there isn’t a 7-eleven down the street to pick up supplies. He has to get pretty inventive but it was amazing reading the things he figured out on his own and how they went right and how they went terribly horribly wrong. Not everything works like you think it will the first time through.***Things are finally going my way. In fact, they’re going great! I have a chance to live after all!LOG ENTRY: SOL 37I am screwed, and I’m gonna die! Okay, calm down. I’m sure I can get around this. I’m writing this log to you, dear future Mars archaeologist, from Rover 2. You may wonder why I’m not in the Hab right now. Because I fled in terror, that’s why!***Will Mark survive? Will they find a way to get him home before his supplies and ingenuity run out? Or will his tragic death be a tourist attraction in 300 years when humans are colonizing the red planet?WHY I LOVED THIS:There are a bunch of reasons why this book worked for me:❶ - The science explanations of how things worked. I enjoyed this part as I’m a bit of a science nerd and I didn’t ever feel bogged down by the math/chemistry/physics stuff. This part might not be as enjoyable for everyone but for me it was totally great.❷ - Mark was fantastic. He was totally likable and I wanted him to survive. He was real, he made mistakes, not everything he tried worked the first time and he has moments of despair. Who wouldn’t being stranded alone on a planet. But no matter what he kept trying, kept going and maintained a pretty good sense of humor along the way.***If I could have anything, it would be a radio to ask NASA the safe path down the Ramp.Well, if I could have anything, it would be for the green-skinned yet beautiful Queen of Mars to rescue me so she can learn more about this Earth thing called “lovemaking.”It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a woman. Just sayin’. Anyway, to ensure I don’t crash again, I’ll— Seriously…no women in like, years. I don’t ask for much. Believe me, even back on Earth a botanist/mechanical engineer doesn’t exactly have ladies lined up at the door. But still, c’mon.”***❸ - The supporting characters. Look I work in a lab and I’ve meet some very smart cerebral people who struggle with people skills. I would expect to find some of these people working at NASA or with their contractors. I liked the inclusion of all the types of people that might be found in job fields.***“Oh, sorry, am I being difficult?” Rich asked. “I’m not good with people. Sometimes I’m difficult. I wish people would just tell me.”…..“Are you sure about this?”“Absolutely!” Rich beamed.“Have you told anyone else?”“Who would I tell?”“I don’t know,” Venkat said. “Friends?”“I don’t have any of those.”“Okay, keep it under your hat.”“I don’t wear a hat.”“It’s just an expression.”“Really?” Rich said. “It’s a stupid expression.”“Rich, you’re being difficult.”“Ah. Thanks.”***❹ - The geek and nerd pop culture references. I seriously live for these in books like this. A reference to Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings etc…can totally make my day if woven in the story well. There are plenty of these throughout the story, but not so many that they become cheap. It is a fantastic blend.***“Elrond,” Bruce said. “The Council of Elrond. From Lord of the Rings. It’s the meeting where they decide to destroy the One Ring.”“Jesus,” Annie said. “None of you got laid in high school, did you?”***❺ - The ‘Moments’ and there are a few where I got a little misty eyed (I swear it is just allergies) as there are certain time in the story that squeeze the feelings right out of your heart. You know that moments in the movie that have the music playing in the background so that you know that at this moment you are supposed to be moved. Well in a book there isn’t music but I had no problem really feeling the situation.What May Cause Issues for Some:So if I worked at NASA and actually knew things about Rovers, HAB units, space trajectories etc…maybe this would be farfetched. But I don’t I only have a minor in Physics and so most of this worked for me.There is a bit of science and math going on especially in the beginning and so maybe if you aren’t used to things like that if might seem a little dense.Note: If you listen to audiobooks at all LISTEN TO THIS ONE ON AUDIO. The narrator R.C. Bray performed the book so well I felt like I was in the story. It was a movie in my head already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRZ61HM4PSLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418025#wasThisHelpful","R3BRZ61HM4PSLT","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is O.K. I didn’t love it or hate it. My problem is that I don’t really like Devi and everything is from her PoV. Maybe I’ve just been hanging out with Heroines like Kate Daniels, Nevada Baylor, Vin, Sirantha Jax (before the (view spoiler)), Jasnah Kholin and MacKayla Lane and so she never stood a chance.The best thing about all of those heroines is that yes they Kick-Ass but they also have some underlying personality traits that make them easy to relate too and likeable even when they are being mean, stubborn or killing those around them. I never felt that way about Devi and I should have I mean she has some cool mechanical suit that lets her kick butt and take names but honestly she wasn’t really a likable character to me.Devi:I should love her. She is a warrior with a metal suit that likes to kill aliens Ellen Ripley. But she is totally in it for her career, where most of the heroines that I’ve mentioned before are in it either for survival or to save the people they care about. Should it matter that it is only about her career….well it shouldn’t but it does since as soon as a guy comes along she totally forgets about it.Other Characters on Board the Glorious Fool:There was so much potential here. With a second in command co-pilot who was a cross between Big Bird and Kevin from Up.  A sexy cook who has some sort of military past and blue eyes that can look right into Devi’s soul….okay so that part was a little annoying.Nova the navigator who might be a little too attuned with space and definitely gives off that Luna Lovegood vibe,  A cannibal lizard medical doctor who just might eat you followed by the mysterious captain and his “daughter” who I think was the creepiest person in the story.It should have been great! Those are a lot of cool characters to work with but I never really got into it. Besides the building tension between Devi and Rupert there wasn’t much to the rest of the characters.The Plot:It took forever for anything to really happen. We were almost at 50% before there is a real conflict and just when I was getting excited about the mystery of why time was behaving funny, what are the captain and crew really up to (because they are definitely not traders) and what is with the weird alien creature hanging out with Ren (the Captain’s creepy Daughter) Devi just drops it. She goes on as if she didn’t just see a bunch of crazy stuff just happen that everyone is trying to cover up and life of the ship goes on as normal. *Sigh*So I wait to see where the story is going and it is just random fight, hurried sex scene followed by a contrived interference in the romance by the Captain and brooding by our completely career driven character that is now completely in love with a man that may or may not be extremely dangerous to her.Still I’d say that the last 20% got really interesting and I was super excited about the new developments in the story and getting really excited about continuing on with the series until…(view spoiler) *throws up a little in my mouth*I thought Devi had proved that she was an asset to whatever it is the captain and crew are up too. I thought she had totally proved her loyalty and so the fact that it was (view spoiler) was a little over the top.Overall Wrap Up:I didn’t get into the MC and so I probably didn’t like this as much as I could have. I DID like the idea of space and some of the species of Aliens that where touched on as well as plasmex. I’d like to learn more about those but this is one of those series that I’ll only continue if the rest of the series goes on sale or is available at the library.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BI32L82K5B06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316221112#wasThisHelpful","R3BI32L82K5B06","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Six has been living in the O’Kane world for a while now and she still doesn’t trust the things she sees. After being treated so bad for most of her life used an abused by the people of her sector it is difficult to trust in her new life and her new protector. But Bren has slowly been coaxing her out of her shell and pretty soon all that patience is going to pay off in some big ways.***  “Her fragile, wounded heart beat too fast, and she knew when she opened her mouth that she was offering it to him. If she was lucky, he'd be too distracted to realize it was busted until she'd jammed enough of the pieces back together to make it worth a damn. ""I trust you.” ***Six is a badass, but we all knew that when she beat Trent to death with her bare hands. Still it is good to see that the O’Kanes realize it too and that the gender roles in the book are pretty open. I loved the way she grew to find her own space in the gang and her own way to contribute. Also any girl who can pummel a guy in a cage is good by me.***  No, not just a roar. Female screams of approval cut above the noise, and she saw a swell of movement over her opponent's shoulder. The O'Kane women, standing on the couches and cheering her on like she was their champion. Like she was one of them. She was gonna kick Elvis's ass.  ***I love men like Bren they really are my reading candy. I totally have a soft spot for the stoic current/former military man who is slightly possessive. Bren is a little more that slightly possessive once he makes a claim he isn’t likely to share her. Bren also isn’t into the general type of dominance so the rules he plays by are a bit different than the other couples in this series. That doesn’t mean the sex isn’t hot, because it totally is. Bren might not share but that doesn’t mean he won’t indulge Six and her voyeuristic tendencies while another couple shares. I don’t care who you are Dallas and Lex having a threesome is going to be good. But Dallas and Lex having a threesome while Six and Bren watch and explore their sexuality at the same time….SCORCHING HOT.But Of course at some point someone in the couple needs to do something stupid so it all blows up before it can be put back together. Bren will need to discover what is really important to him and how much his vendetta against the man from Eden that burned him. Six will need to stand on her own two feet and find her true place in the O’Kanes if she is ever going to be one.I’ve enjoyed both the story lines and the sexy times in this series. Even the snippets of the side character couples that you are waiting to hook up later have been peppered in just enough along with cameos of those already together. I love it all, I know Ace and Rachel’s book is next but I really want Madd’s book. I’m totally loving that man especially when he says something like this… ***  “There was no answer he could give that would fix things, and that hurt most of all. ""I always do the same thing. Love everyone who crosses my path. Love 'em as much as I can, for as long as they need.”  ***I’ve been on a smut binge for about three weeks and I’m good for a little while but I’ll definitely be jumping back into this series when I need another fix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TS9DWD0FVHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPWDKYC#wasThisHelpful","R8TS9DWD0FVHX","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have read any of my reviews for KA books you know that I love her beyond reason. Silly dialogue, weird clippy sentences structure and alpha males galore but I love her. I like this story more than most of hers I’ve read since I really connected with the characters, cuz it is all about the characters. There isn’t really a story beyond them in this. Normally there are bad guys off page or some sort danger but in Deacon’s story all the pain has already happened to him in the past he is the only danger to Cassidy because he has been a broken man for so long.***“Every time I show, I pray to God there’ll be another truck outside your house, a man in your bed. Every time I show, nothin’. You’re alone. No clue why. You the way you are. Goofy. Sweet. Hard-workin’. Happy to sit outside on a porch and sit quiet, doin’ nothin’ but bein’ and listenin’ to a river rush by. The way you look. No man?” I saw him shake his head in disbelief. “It makes no sense. Then you rent a cabin to me knowin’ you should show me the road and that makes even less sense.”***I get Deacon, I can relate to him because he reminds me a bit of how my hubs was when we met minus that whole bounty hunter bit.Personal story time just skip this paragraph to get back to the review. When I met my hubs he was so broken. He’d had a really bad divorce and he wasn’t ready to meet me. He wasn’t in a good place emotionally and struggled so hard not to give his heart to me. But, I knew what a diamond in the rough he was when we met and so I was EXTREMELY patient with him. I waited and wiggled my way into his life and his heart. He was and still is really horrible with expressing his emotions verbally but with facial expressions, physical gestures and deeds I always knew where I stood with him. He tried to push me away a few times thinking he wasn’t good enough for me and that I deserved better (seriously silly since he is so fantastic) and no lie it took him over a year to tell me he loved me...even though I knew he did pretty early on in our relationship. We had a few bumps and bruises along the way and he still isn’t good with verbal affirmations of love but he always makes me feel it and now we are ten years in.Deacon watched Cassidy for six years…watched her break up with her lazy boyfriend..watched her improve the cabins she loved so much from childhood that she bought them. He watched her and wanted her but the entire time he never felt ready, never felt good enough and so he kept his distance. Always coming to cabin 11 and staying watching Cassidy and wanting her but never acting on it, until he did.***“Not easy, fightin’ your pull. Wantin’ to be right here. Knowin’ I was no good for you. Prayin’ you’d get a man so when I’d come back I’d have a reason to stay away.”***Once he was in though he was totally in. The only thing is that his current lifestyle is dangerous, off the grid, mostly illegal and he will not let Cassidy into that world at all.The entirety of this story is about Cassidy and Deacon learning to be together. He is a man a little words, but he is always honest with her and he is the first man she has been with that she has been able to explore some of her darker side sexually with bondage and ass play more on that later though. Deacon has a past that he doesn’t want to share with Cassidy, it haunts him and he never wanted her to know that a world like that existed. But if he can’t let it go or share it with her chances are that Deacon will lose her.I loved watching the building love between Cassie and Deacon. Their banter and play fighting was entertaining and maybe it is just because I saw parts of the beginnings of my own relationship in them I enjoyed it all the more. I could totally relate to them as a couple trying to figure it out. Now inevitably there is always something that happens in books like this and Deacon was an idiot for a little while after he did something really stupid. My only complaint is that I thought Cassidy forgave him too quickly. I get it she missed him terribly and her soul was torn apart but still it seemed a bit too easy for him to get her back. However I loved the idea of using songs in the book as an extension of their feelings in certain moments, because who hasn’t heard a song on the radio and attached it to a pivotal moment in their lives? I had never heard the song Beautiful War by Kings of Leon and had to go look it up so I could feel it at the appropriate moment in the story.***A few disclaimers about the sex in this book: Past the halfway point there is a bit of bondage and ass play. I don’t mind reading about stuff like that at all and there is more than one scene involving ass play on both sides. I found it written pretty hot, but some people are really turned off by stories with that in them so just fair warning on that part. I really liked though how the trust in bondage was portrayed and that it didn’t have to be about dominance, in this it was mainly about complete trust in your partner and experimentation to see what gets both of you hot without any judgement. I’m all for sex scenes like that.Short summary: If you can put aside KA’s writing quirks aside and connect to the characters then this is a really sweet romance between two strong individuals who learn how to share a life together.***“Heart and soul, gut and balls, I love you. There’s no one I’d rather hold . Not until I’m eighty. Not until the day I die.”I felt his words stir the top of my hair. “Do you love me too, my Cassie?”My Cassie.“Heart and soul, belly and womb, I love you too, Deacon.”***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5SUYEF18BNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8T7P86#wasThisHelpful","R1J5SUYEF18BNS","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actual Story is a 3 but BEST DIRTIEST SEX SCENE EVER (my favorite out of any I've read) is a 5 so 4 stars it is.First let’s just say that I thought Beyond Shame had my favorite sex scene ever. Well move over because that one has been bumped to the #2 position to be replaced by one of the sex scenes in this book which now claims the #1 position of Best and Dirtiest Sex Scene I’ve read. I really didn’t think that Kit Rocha could outdo it and then WOW my world was rocked.#1 – Lex’s fantasy come true in Beyond Control#2 - Noelle’s and Jasper’s couple interlude with Lex and Dallas in Beyond Shame#3 – Nora/Soren/Kingsley threesome in The Mistress (The Original Sinners #4)There was nothing hotter in this book than Dallas taking control and giving Lex her fantasy. Directing all the people that touched her and how and when. Making sure that it was all about Lex and her pleasure, reading everything she wanted out of the situation and then ensuring that she got that and more. It was illicit, naughty, dirty and OMG so HOT I melted.Besides that there is Lex who most of the time I love. I mean she is strong, feisty and doesn’t take smack from almost anyone. Plus she owns her sexuality, there is never any shame in her game and she is up for pretty much anything. Also she says stuff like…***”I was Cery's best pupil, but only in certain subjects. Oral sex and improvised weaponry, for example, though rarely in conjunction.”***She is so busy being a badass and saying cool things that sometimes you miss how totally broken she is. She is totally messed up and might be able to share her body and pleasure with almost anyone but she definitely doesn’t know how to share her heart or control.Dallas who is a control freak and just as messed up in his own ways. I mean these two have been circling each other for six years and have done just about everything you can think of sexually except actual intercourse. Because Dallas has rules and one of them is unless he has collared you and you are his alone he will not put his dick in you. He has met his match with Lex who pushes back and doesn’t let him get away with anything.***""What can I say. We like our women only mostly tamed. Where’s the fun in a woman who’d never stab you just a little, if you pissed her off bad enough?”***Lex and Dallas together are a force to be reckoned with and there will be some bumps and bruises along the way as Dallas tries to figure out how to keep a woman he has collared and balance an empire. Lex spends her time coming to terms with her new role, her past and how to be in someone else’s control on a permanent basis.The story wasn’t as good as the first book. It is still interesting as Dallas works out how to get sector 3 under control and rebuild it without compromising his own empire in sector 4. He has to decide what is more important to him, the drive for power or his need for Lex. But let’s be honest the story is really secondary to the sex and there was a lot of hot dirty sex had by all.Warning: This is not for the faint of smut. There are threesomes, foursomes, sexsomes and gender is pretty irrelevant. But I love that I never feel like at any time a woman is being disrespected or abused. It is all consensual and done in a caring and loving mannor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQXXHFP2T5L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTPZPZK#wasThisHelpful","R1WQXXHFP2T5L2","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 Only Half a War is Fought with Swords StarsOverall Series Rating:  3.75 StarsHalf a King: 3.5 StarsHalf a World: 4.5 StarsIf you have read books by Joe Abercrombie (JA) before then you know he never wraps everything up at the end with tidy ribbons and bows and Happily Ever Afters. Nope nothing as trite and cliché as that, he gives the reader some hard truths about the characters they have come to love. He makes sure we know the world is not black and white but many shades of gray and most importantly…***“Every hero is someone’s villain.”***It is two years after the events of Half a World and just like in Half a World a good portion of the story revolves around a few new characters. I want to say that I loved them right away but I didn’t. It took some time to appreciate the introduction of Skara and Raith into the story but they do eventually find a place that becomes interesting and make the story better.JA’s books are more about the characters and their journeys than the actual plots of the story. Skara learning how to be a Queen and use words as weapons and transforming from a scared little girl into a woman sure of her power. Raith was once a stone cold killer and hot head learning to becoming a protector and knowing the difference between the two. Yarvi is much changed from the boy he was in Half a King. He has become a ‘deep cunning’ man that many refer to as the spider now for all the webs he has woven. Thorn is not the same young girl full of anger and no direction she is a powerful woman sure of herself and protector of the Queen. Koll once a little boy saved by Yarvi has become a young man searching for a way to change the world but torn between the promises of greatness Yarvi dangles in front of him or happiness in the arms of a woman he loves.***“When you finally swear your Minister’s Oath, Koll, it will be a loss to wood carving.” Yarvi gave a weighty sigh. “But you cannot change the world with a chisel.”“You can change it a little,” said Rin, folding her arms as she looked up at the minister. “And for the better.”“His mother asked me to make him the best man he could be.”Koll shook his head frantically behind his master’s back, but Rin was not to be shut up.“Some of us quite like the man he is,” she said.***I cared about most of characters, so much that it hurt when bad things happened to them and it hurt more when they were the ones who did the bad things. Everyone has a breaking point and in a war the lines of right and wrong can become as blurred as chalk painting after a rainstorm. Some characters I wanted redemption for and others I wanted their blood.I don’t want to spoil anything for anyone. There are a few surprises in store for the readers. I took a few character deaths really hard and the fact a couple characters made it out alive at the end I took even harder. But that is how it goes right? Not everyone in life gets what they deserve. I think that everyone will have their own opinions on what some of the characters really deserved at the end.This was my least favorite book of the trilogy. A lot of that has to do with the fact that I am more of a sunshine and rainbows love conquers all ending kind of girl in my reading. JA likes to leave his stories at a place where it isn’t really the end but the start of new chapters in most of the characters’ lives. He leaves it open for the reader to decide what will happen to them next throughout their lives as they open up new beginnings.The ending even though I figured out who the traitor was at about the middle mark of the book was still really great. I am conflicted of course but I’m meant to be, that was the point. I was so torn between wanting some sort of redemption for that character or the death I thought they deserved. It is harder when you understand all the motivations of the characters and can see both sides of the situation so clearly, like I said shades of gray.******Quick Rundown*******Pros –✔ - Great complex characters. Love all the strong female characters in this book. Blue Jenner was one of my favorite minor characters in this.✔ - Outstanding Twist to the Ending✔ - Unconventional non HEA for everyone ending✔ - Repeatable quote lines like ”Death comes for us all.”✔ - The Elf City (a little creepy but it was an interesting inclusion into the story)Cons -✗- Unconventional non HEA for everyone ending (Yes I know this is in the Pros but I’m so torn. I love HEAs and seriously I think only 2 people got them out of everyone in the book and a few people haven’t got their just desserts YET )✗- Some boring time as I was getting used to the new characters. I didn’t initially like them in the story.✗- The destruction of the High King. It sorta fizzled at the end.Overall a solid trilogy and I could see some other stories being set in this world later.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1QE7MTHE5WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRQW7Y6#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1QE7MTHE5WF","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series isn’t your typical sort of fantasy. Most of the book is more intellectual than actionable in that I spent most of the time trying to figure out the subtle interactions between Eugenides and the Queen of Attolia.After a few books shown from the PoVs of Eudenidies and The Queens it was interesting that most of this book was shown from the perspective of Costis a member of the Attolian guard. At first I didn’t really understand what the author was doing, but then it made perfect sense. It was a much more interesting story to see how everyone else in Attolia perceived Gen and try to figure out what he was really up to. If we got the story from his perspective then the mystery of it wouldn’t have been half as entertaining. I almost feel bad for Costis caught in whatever game Gen is playing.***“Don’t hang Teleus. But I don’t see how you can hang Costis if you won’t hang his superior officer.”The queen turned back to face him.“I could hang you,” she said.Eugenides looked up at her. “You missed your chance for that,” he said.The queen lifted a hand to briefly cover her eyes. “It is remarkable how you cloud my otherwise clear vision,” she said. “What is it you propose?”“I propose that you let me trade him to Teleus. His life in return for Teleus’s good behavior.”***AND LET THE GAMES BEGIN…..The people of Attolia have made sure that Gen does not feel the least bit welcome in their country. Most of the time they like to refer to him as a jumped-up barbarian goatfoot and play little vengeful tricks on him in order to chip away at his resolve and respect. It was so weird to see what they thought of him since we know how deadly he truly is.***The gods above knew that the king could be laid out by a toddler with a toasting fork. What hope had he against an assassin, trained as a sword is sharpened, honed to one purpose, to murder?***I really enjoyed trying to figure out myself what game he was playing and why he was pretending to be so much less than he was. While I was certain there was something up I struggled to put the clues together. Everyone thought that they were getting the best of Eugenides, when he was really maneuvering them to move to the steps of the dance he set in motion.We get little glimpses of Gen and the Queen together and it made it all the more special to also see those through Costis’s eyes. There aren’t a lot of them as this is not a romance per say but the moments we get really are pretty beautiful and spectacular because there aren’t a lot of them.***“Tell me you won’t cut out my lying tongue, tell me you won’t blind me, you won’t drive red-hot wires into my ears.”After one moment of gripped immobility, the queen bent to kiss the king lightly on one closed eyelid, then on the other. She said, “I love your eyes.” She kissed him on either cheek, near the small lobe of his ear. “I love your ears, and I love”—she paused as she kissed him gently on the lips—“every single one of your ridiculous lies.”***There are a few moments of action in the book. But for the most part it is a political maneuvering conspiracy and most of the fun was in the revelation of clues and the big reveal of why Eugenides would put up with so much for so long. There was a great sword fight towards the end and I enjoyed the reason behind it and why it finally happened. It was great to see Gen finally figure out his place in Attolia and claim it in true Thief fashion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BA3J9CNP6MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OMZTQ2#wasThisHelpful","R30BA3J9CNP6MB","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shhhh….Kristen Ashley (KA) is the author that is my dirty secret guilty pleasure. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, I shouldn’t like her books. The dialogue is sometimes ridiculous with clipped sentences, silly alpha gruffness and pet names. Often she includes extra character details of side characters that aren’t necessary (more with The Burg series than her others) and she likes to describe clothes and setting BUT…I love her stories. KA’s blend of romance with uber alphas has this balance of angst, sweetness, drama and decent plots that I always get dragged in and I love it.Raid is no different once I started I didn’t want to stop until the end. Hannah is a cute small town girl that takes care of her grandmother and has had a crush on the same boy most of her life. Raid is ex-Military and really has no clue that Hannah existed. He’s dated some wild girls but never fathomed settling down until he met her. He has a dangerous not so legal job and a past to deal with, but once he sets his sights on the good girl next door there is no stopping him.***I’m tellin’ you, Hanna, you be careful. You go forward cautious. Hard to guard your heart from a man like that who’ll do nothing and everything to win it in a way you’ll want him to own it forever. But mind this, child. Raiden Miller doesn’t find a way to beat back the danger lurking within, he’ll go down and he’ll take you down right along with the blaze of hellfire he’s got burning inside, he battles that and wins, you will know nothing for the rest of your life, no taste, no experience, not even the birth of your children that will be sweeter than the love he’ll have for you.”***Everything between them is more intense than Hannah ever thought it could be. But to keep him she will have to find a way to help him heal the hole he has inside him and learn how to stand tall against him when she pushes the walls he has built up around himself.Hannah is easily likable and the relationship she has with her great-grandmother was so adorable. I always like the family relationships that KA includes in her stories. She likes to write about places with a small town feel to them where everyone knows everyone else and it is a place you would love to visit. Raid, well while for the most part I liked him he had some crap to work through and could be dick from time to time. But you never question what he feels for Hannah and how much he wants to be a good man for her and protect her.The unfinished hero series isn’t my favorite of the KA series but it is a good shorter fix in-between some of her longer books like those of ‘The Burg’ or ‘Fantasyland’ series and sometimes a girl just needs her KA fix.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X8D7EWS7Q9G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615766412#wasThisHelpful","R1X8D7EWS7Q9G5","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading The Casual Vacancy I had decided that I probably wouldn’t read any of her adult fiction books. I didn’t expect it to be like Harry Potter but I really wasn’t expecting it to be more of a character study and it was really bleak. I was depressed after reading it. I mention this because I didn’t have very high hopes going into The Cuckoo’s Calling and therefore I am pleasantly surprised.This is a pretty straight up who-dun-it. There isn’t a lot of action or anything like that it is an intellectual, interview the people and come up with the big picture. Think Rockford Files, Simon and Simon, Nancy Drew, Angel (without the vampires). I’ve read where some people figured it out and knew who the killer was and to them I say BRAVO…cuz I failed completely. Yes, all the clues were there and I should have been able to put it all together but I looked left when I totally should have looked right and so I was surprised. But I totally like it when I’m fooled.Strike is a likeable enough fellow. He is a bit down on his luck both professionally and personally but that is not going to stop him from trying to get something done. I was rooting for Strike he is pretty likable as a down-and-out-just-trying-to-pick-up-the-pieces-character. ***  “Other people his age had houses and washing machines, cars and television sets, furniture and gardens and mountain bikes and lawnmowers: he had four boxes of crap, and a set of matchless memories.” ***He has a very easy repore with people and a way of getting them to talk, controlling the situation without seeming like he is controlling the situation and he was a bit of a romantic in some ways even if his own romance was completely in the toilet.Robin his new temporary secretary has always dreamed of a job like this, even if her new employer doesn’t seem excited to have her there. But she is going to make the most of this experience while she is looking for a permanent position. This was a very good start to a working relationship and hmmm….could it go in the direction of a romantic entanglement eventually. Well Robin does have a fiancé now but things can change. Can’t they? I definitely see a budding relationship of some sort there, whether it turns into a strong friendship later or more I’ll be fine either way. But I think that dress will cause some problems...teheeOverall it was a decent mystery and I enjoyed the interviews with the various characters. There is quite a bit about Strike, his past, his current stalker and I liked diving into all of that. It made him feel far more real to me. I will definitely be continuing on with this pseudonym of J.K Rowling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VLCWC645IGUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316206857#wasThisHelpful","R1VLCWC645IGUE","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked The Thief it was a solid 3 star read, it took a little while to get into but the ending was very solid. The Queen of Attolia though….well let’s just say that it had some very unexpected and crazy surprises in store for me. It was so much better than the first book with complex characters and more than one twist I wasn’t expecting. I really love it when a book blindsides me with something that I never saw coming and there were exactly 3 instances in this book where I had no clue ‘that’ was going to happen until the bomb dropped.This series might seem to read a little slower than some other fantasy novels because a lot of the tension and build up is political intrigue and posturing. It is about cunning and sneakiness, who is telling the truth, who is lying and is everything what it seems or something else entirely. I like smart dialogue like that where I’m trying to figure out the true motives and intention of all those involved. I had inklings and suspicions of the actions and reactions of all the characters but I never once knew for sure and to me that is extremely entertaining.The characters and their emotions are complex and intricate. I started this book disliking the Queen of Attolia, shortly into this I despised her, then I grew to maybe feel some empathy for her, to finally possibly understanding her and perhaps maybe now I have an smidgen of like happening for her. It was an emotional journey and I can say definitively that I have a healthy respect for her character. She is smart, cunning, manipulative and merciless sometimes. But The Queen of Attolia is a great three dimensional character doing her best to rule a country full of Baron’s who do not want to be ruled by her and she is so alone.*** --There was a shadow behind the wardrobe, a deeper one at the edge of the window curtains. She sat up against her pillows. She pulled the bedclothes up as far as they would go and suppressed a perverse wish to have her old nurse come to chase away the darkness, perverse because she didn’t know if she wanted the shadows to be empty or not. She sat watching until the day dawned and the shadows lightened and were gone.***Eugenides totally WOWED me. His growth in this book alone is amazing. He is not just the scheming prankster of a boy he once was. He went through some very traumatic experiences in this book and they have changed him. He is different now, but we the readers get to travel with him through that transformation and it is not always easy. This book is sometimes much darker than the previous installment. Eugenides might have taken a little time to bounce back after his tragedy but he got there with a little nudging.***”Stop whining. Eugenides said.“What?” Eddi’s expression shifted from wary to puzzled.“That was the message. Fe me, alone among mortals, the gods send their messenger to tell me to stop whining. That’ll teach me to go hide in the temple.”***I had so much fun watching Eugenides get back on his feet and up to his old tricks. Everyone better watch out, he has a new ambition and plan that I think he was willing to go to the grave for.Eddis is another great character and smart Queen. It is so interesting to compare how similar and different she and Attolia are. Each is ruthless for their people and will do anything for those they care about. They are both smart, cunning and able to see into the true motivations of those around them. But where Attolia is surrounded by people trying to take a kingdom away from her Eddis is surrounded by family, friends and subjects that would protect and keep her in power at any cost. Eddis is allowed to seem softer and kinder because of this but do not let that fool you she is just as ferocious.***“Magus,” she said from the doorway. “I’d heard that you had come.”Eugenides swung to look at her. “You started a war in my name without telling me?” he asked.“You will have to excuse me,” said the queen to the magus as if she hadn’t heard. “I overslept, or I would have greeted you earlier.”“Are we at war with Attolia?” Eugenides demanded.“Yes,” said his queen.“And Sounis?” asked Eugenides.“Nearly,” said Eddis.***Being a Queen at war leaves no room for sympathy in most. The battle between the two Queens showed how each used their strengths to maneuver against opponents. I enjoyed the alternating PoVs to get a full picture of the story.I was happily surprised by the direction this story took and I had a great time trying to figure out who was going to outmaneuver who. I think Eugenides wins in that regard though. I think he could test a monk’s patience and get Gandhi into trouble. I’m really interested in seeing what he will do in his new role for the next book. Barron’s Beware, Eugenides is coming for you is really all I can think of saying on that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9DOGRFYJ0KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OMZTXA#wasThisHelpful","R3E9DOGRFYJ0KZ","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cast Iron is great for the great outdoors.  The best thing about this skillet is that it is made to fit perfectly on the any of the Camp Chef or Camp Chef Pro series outdoor grills.  This skillet fits over one burner.  So if you have the 2 burner version you can fit 2 of these skillets or combo it up with any of the other Camp Chef accessories. My husband likes to use it as is with the open flame burner.  The outside of the skillet is slightly hotter than directly in the middle and he plans the food out accordingly.  But if you need the temperature to be uniform I suggest getting a heat diffuser that will work in combination to make sure that everything is heated the same.  This is the heat diffuser we got to use with ours.http://www.amazon.com/Camp-Chef-FT10-Flame-Tamer/dp/B000PGG5BW/ref=sr_1_1?s=outdoor-recreation&ie=UTF8&qid=1437497533&sr=1-1&keywords=camp+chef+heat+diffuserCast Iron is easy to clean and take care of.  As long as you make sure it is seasoned properly they last forever.It is so nice to have the option for either the smooth surface for eggs, bacon and pancakes and then late flip it to grill burgers, chicken and hot dogs with just one skillet.  The grease catch is a good addition so you can keep your cooking area free of excess grease and oil.A must have for any camping trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173G1IUID4WJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J087N8#wasThisHelpful","R173G1IUID4WJL","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got a Camp Chef Pro 2 burner gas grill and found that the outside of the skillet or pan tended to get a lot more hot than the middle.  These are the best things we found to make sure that the heat from the burner is uniform.  We use these whenever we are cooking with a cast iron skillet, percolator coffee pot or dutch oven.

"3.5 Storm My Castle StarsTo me this book is like a Will Ferrell movie, in that sometimes the comedy and shenanigans were hilarious and working so well that at one point I was thinking ‘this is the best NA book I’ve read this year’ but then later it was so OVER THE TOP and the same gags just kept going on and on that I was thinking ‘I wish this book ended nearer to the 80% mark because now it is just driving me crazy.’Don’t get me wrong for 80% of this book I was having an extraordinarily good time and it would have totally had a 5 star rating but that last 20% I’m sad to say crashed it to a 3 star overall. Still I love the premise of friends from childhood who can’t seem to figure out how to move it past that even though it is clear to everyone around them that they are made for each other.Let’s talk about some of the things I totally loved in this story:① - Milo is a hot mess, if it can go wrong it does and she is usually in the middle of it and someone always ends up with a slight injury. But she is pretty adorable and I was rooting for her from the beginning to find a way to get Colton. They have this easy repoire when just kidding around and teasing each other but once they get close together it all becomes a jumbled mess. After Colton kisses Milo and then apologizes for it she is crushed and accidentally starts a chain of events that become hilarious.***“Milo, say my name if you did something really stupid and unforgiveable like the time you told me I wouldn’t get a splinter in my ass for using a wood sled.”“Max . . .” I purred, trying to sound sexy.Colton leaned in like he was trying to listen to our conversation. I glared at him, hoping he’d back off and give me space.“S*** balls. Oh, look, a bus! What? What was that? You want to throw me under it?”Her best friend is going to help her figure out how to get the man she wants so desperately even if that means he has to pretend to be her boyfriend for her brother’s wedding weekend. Which brings us to…② - Max. I’m not sure if I want a best friend like Max or not. Actually I take that back I totally do. How many best friends would give you the low down on how to seduce a man and try to drive him crazy with you? He totally went above and beyond and probably gave Milo a few tips along the way. No worries no love triangle here but Max pushed Milo to a few limits. I might have liked him more than Milo and Colton.***""I’m not your sexless friend, I’m not your damn brother. I’m not you gay friend. And I sure as hell am not thinking about anything right now except that your hands feel really good against my skin. So I’m going to kiss you, and you’re going to respond like the idea of my mouth on yours doesn’t make you want to cry---and you’ll like it.”I loved their friendship and how well they knew each other. Both accepted the other for who they were and they had an easy teasing banter about them that was so much fun.③ - The slapstick comedy of some of it. Poor Jason (Milo’s brother) it is his wedding weekend and it seems that every time the poor guys turns around something else awful happens to him, usually because of Milo. He has bumps and bruises all over the place. Most of book it is super funny and I laughed pretty hard.There are a lot of hilarious moments where someone walks in at just the right time. Milo is completely oblivious to the affect she seems to have on Colton and getting both PoVs makes that all the more fun. Also there is dealing with a slightly unhinged bride who might just not make it to the actual wedding without a huge meltdown.***“Honey, you said you wanted red.”Aw, poor Mom. The situation was like trying to calm a hippo. It was going to charge you regardless of how nice your words were. It would charge you, and then either drown you or sit on you.④ - No extreme tragedy in their pasts. I hate this trope in NA. You don’t have to have a completely broken and traumatized MC to carry your story. I think most people in their early 20s have had good and bad things happen to them but not every NA story has to come from somewhere so bleak to be good. Everyone in this story had a pretty normal childhood and they were relatable characters.Let’s talk about some of the things that didn’t work in the story:I was totally on board with most of this story until the touchy feely grandma showed up. She was funny the first time she did something slightly scandalous and pervy. After that it became a little too weird and it was the gag that just would not stop. It actually started to make me feel uncomfortable and it wasn’t funny but totally creepy.Most of the stuff going into the wedding seemed a bit over the top and then why can’t Milo and Colton get a freaking minute alone getting to some actual sexy time took forever.Overall:Most of the story is funny and compelling but the end needed a little work. However all’s well that ends well and I did like the ending of this story. I’m even going to read the next one because it is about Max and I loved his character.If you haven’t read Boomerang or Fangirl then I’d say give those a try in the NA genre first. But if you want something silly with some really cute moments and only a little bit of sex then this is a fun read. I totally recommend getting the audiobook version if you like those.Audio Note: Nick Podel and Amy McFadden MADE this book. This is probably one of those times that a book actually earn an extra 1/2 - 1 star just because the narrators do such a fantastic job performing the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7J28DE6ZPOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9QJVSW#wasThisHelpful","R3J7J28DE6ZPOC","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 I'm Gonna Burn in Hell Stars#whoknewi'dlikethat #smuttysososmutty #soashamednotashamed #myladypartsaretinglyI asked a few Goodreads friends for some recommendations for something sexy and hot. Well they totally came through THIS WAS SCORCHING. Thank you Sarah.I started it with the intention of only reading the first few chapters…I didn’t stop reading until I was completely done. My only warning is this is not for the faint of smut it has M/F/M, F/F/M, M/F M/F, /F/M, F/F, public sex and just to make it all the more naughty a little BDSM thrown in. I had no idea that I would love it so much.Let me just make this clear…this is total porn reading and I’m not a prude by any means when it comes to my sexy reading but I don’t think I’ve ever read something that totally dragged me in like this did (except possibly books 3 and 4 of The Original Sinners Series). I really didn’t think I would be all about a male dominated world where everyone is pretty free with sex and sharing partners. I thought I would feel like it was degrading to the women…IT WASN’T. Never at any time in this book did I feel like any of the male characters (who were still quite alpha) degraded or trivialized the woman/women they were with. If anything they were all about making sure the woman was satisfied in every way.--  “There was something dangerously seductive in his words, a promise that he'd been watching her, learning her, that he understood all the dark twists and turns that made up her desire and wouldn't hesitate to follow them. She could have anything she wanted--everything--but only if she trusted him to give it to her.”Beyond Shame had some of the hottest sex scenes I’ve ever read but what is really amazing is that it also had an interesting story line and characters. In a dystopian world there is the city beyond the walled in haven of Eden that is full of gangs, territories and every kind of debauchery known to man. When Noelle is cast out of Eden into the hard streets she meets up with one of the gangs that run them and learns what it means to really open herself to feelings and live the life she only heard rumors and tales about in her perfect princess world.--  “It was like one of her dark fantasies come to life. Jasper, looming over her bound, helpless body, rasping dirty commands. Orders that absolved her of any complicity in her own defilement.”Oh and Jasper is so willing to show Noelle the ropes and make sure she gets a taste of everything she is curious about. But beyond that there are other gangs to contend with, territory wars and possibly a threat from within Eden too.This was a great introduction into a completely different way of life and a sexy, deadly and interesting world. I loved all the glimpses I got of other characters and set ups for future relationships. I autoclicked on the next three books of the series without a second thought as I’m eager to continue on and see what else Kit Rocha can come up with.I don’t think it will be for everyone…hell if you asked me before I started it I didn’t think that it would really be for me…and yet I LOVED EVERY DIRTY WORD OF IT.

"Recently I asked a few goodreads friends to help me out with some recommendations for something light with some sexy times in it and if possible a good audiobook version to go along with the ebook. Let’s just say they did not fail me. I got some great recommends and this was one of them.This is my first Lisa Kleypas novel and I enjoyed it so much I’m sure it won’t be my last. The build of sexual tension was so good and even the storyline was really enjoyable. Mr. Bronson is new to the aristocracy, he has a lot of money but not the manners a true gentleman needs for society. Lady Holly is a widow still very much in love with the memory of a man who died three years ago. In a chance meeting in the dark Mr. Bronson mistakes her for the Lady he has arranged a liaison with and before he realizes the mistake he has kissed her and ignited something neither one was expecting. Now he just has to figure out how to claim her and make her his own.-- ""It was a special agony to be placed under the power of a virtuous woman. The only consolation was that she didn’t seem to understand how completely he was in her thrall""Lady Holly ends up in Bronson’s home to teach manners and etiquette to his sister, mother and himself in an attempt to help them be more accepted into society and find good matches. The Bronson’s are a fun lot and even though it isn’t like living with her husband’s family Holly finds that there is a place for her there. There is even a growing attraction to Bronson that she can’t deny.While I liked Holly from the beginning it took a little time to really start to appreciate and like Zachary Bronson. He has some tomcatting and debaucherious ways about him in the beginning of the book that detracted from his likability. He is overly generous to those he cares about with his money but it took a little time for him to discover that he wasn’t happy frequenting whore houses and such when he cared for the very innocent Lady Holly living beneath his roof. I especially loved how kind and attentive he was to Lady Holly’s child Rose. Rose is freaking adorable by the way.--  “What is that, Miss Rose?”“My button string.” The child let some of the length fall to the ground, displaying a line of carefully strung buttons…picture buttons etched with flowers, fruit or butterflies, ones made of molded black glass and a few of painted enamel and paper. “This one is my perfume button,” Rose said proudly, fingering a large one with velvet backing. She lifted it to her nose and inhaled deeply. “Mama puts her perfume on it for me, to make it smell nice.”Sure this has some of the things that most Historical Romances do. A rake of a man is tamed by a virtuous woman but this also incorporated the difference in classes and how the Ton didn’t take well to new blood without aristocratic lineage coming into their ranks.Definitely an enjoyable romance","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20AHAMIPNVZ3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2KI8#wasThisHelpful","R20AHAMIPNVZ3V","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before you pick this book up you need to ask yourself…’Am I ready to get my geek on???’ As soon as I saw that Ernest Cline author of Ready Player One had another book coming out and it was narrated by Wil Wheaton my amazon/audible one click pre-order went cRaZy and I shoved my money at them.I’m just going to put it out there I liked Ready Player One more. So if you haven’t ready that yet GO GET IT!!! But Armada has some very nice characteristics too that should make it a Pop Culture/Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Gamer lover’s dream. I know that my geek meter was pegged out as I had the best time looking to catch movie lines, character references and gaming lingo and there was a plethora of that dropped all throughout the story.The entire premise of the book really boils down to this –***What if they’re using videogames to train us to fight without us even knowing it? Like Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid, when he made Daniel-san paint his house, sand his deck, and wax all of his cars—he was training him and he didn’t even realize it! Wax on, wax off—but on a global scale!So pretty much think of a mash up of things like The Last Star Fighter and Ender’s Game (which are referenced many times in the story along with Star Wars and Star Trek). Hey even though I’ve seen this plot before it is a good premise and a lot of fun for the story.Zack is a kid with daddy issues and possibly a moderate gaming addiction. He is trying to decide whether his fantasy life has become reality or if he is just hallucinating when he sees an alien spacecraft from his favorite MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) Armada outside his school. Maybe he is going crazy or maybe…just maybe all the Sci-Fi movies, TV Shows and Books since the 70s has all been preparing us for THIS exact moment in time. That is when everything goes wonky and gets crazy.There are some fantastically funny side characters that give us plenty of opportunity for some geeked out fun of dropping movie quotes, song lyrics and debates on the best cinema Melee Weapon.“Sting wasn’t even really a sword,” Diehl was saying. “It was more like a glow-in-the-dark Hobbit butter knife, used to spread jam on scones and lembas bread and s***.”Cruz rolled his eyes. “’Your love of the halflings’ leaf has clearly slowed your mind,’” he quoted. “Sting was an Elvish blade, forged in Gondolin in the First Age! It could cut through almost anything! And its blade only glowed when it detected the presence of orcs or goblins nearby. What does Mjolnir detect? Fake accents and frosted hair?”And possibly my favorite since I also like to use swear words from worlds in books and movies…Airsick Lowlanders!!! (<---This is my favorite to use)“S***!” I heard Diehl shout over the comm. “I just lost my gorram shields because I’m already out of frakkin’ power!”“Dude,” Cruz said. “You shouldn’t mix swears from different universes.”“Says who?” Diehl shot back. “Besides, what if BSG and Firefly took place in the same universe? You ever consider that?”Remarkably I’ve had discussions similar to this with Hubs and friends so this book easily called to me. There were shout outs to Authors like Patrick Rothfuss and Orsen Scott Card, along with so many Star Trek and Star Wars references I couldn’t keep track. Also Cline hit on Galaxy Quest, Navigator, Aliens, 2001 a Space Odyssey, Iron Eagle, Top Gun…Say Anything (okay you might not think that one fits but it totally does) and much much more. There is even just enough time for a minor blooming romance to start. So you might be asking yourself…Why Robin did you only give it 3 stars? Well as much as I loved the pop culture geek fest in this I got bored with the action scenes and I’m iffy on how I feel about the ending.My gaming experience is limited to World of Warcraft, Bejeweled, Wii, Super Mario Cart and Candy Crush…don’t judge me. I’m not a huge fan of first person shooter games and a large portion of the fighting is based on that. My imagination totally sucks when it comes to flying robots and ship fighting one another in space shooting lasers. I KNOW it should be exciting and if someone had pulled out a Katana and started hacking away through enemy lines I would have totally dug it and been able to really imagine it well, but I struggled so much with this part of the story and lost a little interest in it.Also Ready Player One had an upbeat ending and a HEA feeling to it. While this is not all destruction and mayhem, although there was a lot of that, the ending didn’t leave me feeling happy or even sad I was just OH…I’m not sure I liked that. I’m not sure I didn’t like it either but definitely felt odd about it. I was slightly upset that it went the direction that it did in the final chapters.While the ending does close out this book to be read as a stand-alone, there is just enough of an opening for there to be a sequel down the line. Would I read it??? WELL YESSS of coarse I would and I’d probably autobuy it as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ0KGS4YLLN58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137250#wasThisHelpful","RQ0KGS4YLLN58","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a quick read full of lots of smexy time. I think about half the book is spent on smexy time, this is not a bad thing when that is what you are looking for and it was totally what I was looking for right now. Sometimes I love to just shut my brain off and just go with the ride which is exactly what I did with Burned.--  “What am I going to do with you, Collin McDaniels? You make me want things I haven’t thought about in years. You make me dream things I never thought possible.”He shrugs and uses the tips of his fingers to brush my bangs out of my eyes. “It’s never too late to live your dreams. You just have to want them enough to make them come true.”I understood Finnley for the most part, the struggles she had with her soon-to-be ex-husband and his addictions. I was once in a bad relationship with someone with addiction issues and they can be master manipulators, it doesn’t start all at once they slowly drag you down until things you never thought you’d put up with ever become normal, but just like Finnley once you hit that wall and you are done you are done. Time to move on and move on Finnley did quite well.After running into Collin her ex-boyfriend from High School, Finnley is reminded of the person she used to be and how much chemistry there is between them. She definitely finds a piece of her sexuality that she thought might not be there anymore either and realizes that with the right person exploring your sexuality can be an exciting and erotic adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed the smexy times throughout Burned. There were some interesting scenes and Collin was definitely into expanding her horizons. I’d never thought of using a speaker like that.While there is some angst with Finnley’s ex-husband to be Jordan, it added to the overall story plot line. Jordan might have gone a little over the top but I was having too much fun with the other stuff I didn’t care. I also enjoy it when there is a great girl friendship in books. Phina and Finnley have been friends forever and always have each other’s back. I love it when girls don’t let a handsome guy come in-between them.Wanna know why Phina is my best friend? Please tell me how many women would walk away from a make-out session with a gorgeous fireman without a single protest.So if you are looking for something cotton candy with a lot of sexy and a decent plot, this is a quick fix. I think I read it in about 3 hours.  I actually listened to half on audiobook and then finished the story with the ebook.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ZFXXGJHJT9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUXDTNW#wasThisHelpful","R32ZFXXGJHJT9X","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reason that we purchased this model over some of the other Camp Chef’s really came down to the front interface.  On some of the other Camp Chef models the burners are positioned in a way that the knobs are angled in.  This seemed inconvenient to us.  You also needed a fire source to ignite the units.  The benefit of Camp Chef Pro is the front panel with the easy access knobs and the igniter switch.  This make the unit a little more like our BBQ at our house and so it is more user friendly.The amount of heat generated by the burners is great and we love to use this with our cast iron pans.  But we did notice hot and cool spots so if you need more uniform heating I suggest getting a heat diffuser to equilibrate the spread of the heat.

"The case is pretty well constructed and fit snuggly around the phone.  All of the holes were in good locations and all ports needed are easily accessible.  The rubber over the power button and the +/- volume button are a little stiff after first installed but seem to be loosening up a bit after the first few days.  It is a little more difficult to undo the power cord cover because of the case thickness but I found I also got used to that after a few days.The kickstand in the back works really well if the phone is horizontal but when the phone is vertical it tips over easily.  It does work fine vertically if the phone is upside down but then you have to change your setting to allow the screen to swivel to that, which was more of a pain than it was worth to me so I just use the kickstand when the phone is horizontal.I like the color and it doesn’t seem like a cheap screen print that will just run off.

"If I can say nothing else about Rick Riordan (RR) I will say he is without a doubt an entertaining storyteller no matter what age you are. While his Percy Jackson series are still my favorites I enjoyed this book more than The Red Pyramid.The best thing about this book is that there are more kids. It just makes for a little more humor when you have kids interacting with other kids instead of adults. Now that Sadie and Carter are helping to train some new kids at Brooklyn house there is rooms for some new and interesting characters.--  “Felix believed that the answer to every problem involved penguins; but it wasn't fair to birds, and I was getting tired of teleporting them back home. Somewhere in Antarctica, a whole flock of Magellanic penguins were undergoing psychotherapy.”Carter and Sadie need to find a way to awaken Ra if they are going to beat Apophis (god of Chaos) but he has been missing for quite awhile and they will need to find some ancient artifacts to help them.RR adds his own spin on Egyptian mythology and ‘The Gods’ that is entertaining, informative and interesting. I always feel like I’m learning about the culture as well as being entertained by the story. There were all kinds of new gods and obstacles to deal with along the way and Sadie and Carter have to prove even to the gods that want Ra to return they are strong enough to complete the task.I love the sibling relationship between Cater and Sadie. They antagonize and provoke each other but they are also the firt to stand up and fight for their sibling if they are ever in danger. Sadie’s PoV chapters were my favorites but that is probably because she is so snarky and gets to have most of the funny lines.-  “Our camels plodded along. Katrina tried to kiss, or possibly spit on Hindenburg, and Hindenburg farted in response. I found this a depressing commentary on boy-girl relationships.”Carter still feels responsible for Zia and has been trying to find her ever since he found out she was hidden away for her safety. But he might just be a little obsessed, so much so that he is seeing clues everywhere.-  “Carter, not to be unkind,"" I said, ""but the last few months you've been seeing messages about Zia everywhere. Two weeks ago, you thought she was sending you a distress call in your mashed potatoes.""  ""It was a Z! Carved right in the potatoes!”There is always something happening with all the mini quests before the big one and I will say that Ra really wasn’t what I was expecting, which kinda made it all the better. Who said waking up a god would be easy never went looking for one with and evil Ice Cream vendor hot on their trail.Add in the hint of a blossoming romance between Sadie and Walt or Sadie and Anubus and this story has a little bit of everything. It is the cutest crush triangle I’ve read and I’m not sure which way I want it to go. All in all a fun and entertaining ride. Sure this is a MG book but it is just as fun for kids of all ages.If you haven’t read the Percy Jackson series I’d say read that first (so much better than the movies). But if you have might as well expand your RR mythology and add a little Egyptian to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PWR3M25OXQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KZP18W#wasThisHelpful","R7PWR3M25OXQW","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EVERYONE told me not to expect much from this book and to be patient. They said the beginning isn’t very good but the second half is pretty good and the next two books are amazing…so just hang in there. Well I found that to be true and false at the same time.It is true the second half of this book is much more interesting, there is more going on action wise and the last 100 pages just fly by. But the first half isn’t that shabby either if you are paying attention. The only reason parts of it felt a little long are the backstories to the gods feathered in a little like info-dumping. They are interesting lore stories but it is unclear how they fit into the book until later and almost felt like filler while I was reading them. However with Gen the Master Thief there are clues to be found and double meanings to a few things that don’t become clear until the end of the book. I found it to be quite entertaining trying to figure out who/what Gen really is and what his true purpose was.But even if you find the first half a little dull this is a short book at only about 215 pages so it really doesn’t take that long to go through and figuring out Gen’s story is totally worth it. He is a lot of fun to read as he is antagonizing his traveling companions.-- 'While we ate, I picked at the magus. I liked to watch him lose his temper and then regain it when he remembered that I was supposed to be beneath his contempt.'I did guess quite a few things about Gen correctly, but I also guessed just as many wrong so there were still some surprises to be had and enough interest generated about the three kingdoms in the story that I’d be interested in continuing.Even though this book is listed as MG/YA it didn’t really read that way and I hear the later books are more adult than this one. Overall a really quick fun read that had action, mystery, betrayal and a few unexpected surprises that made it all the more interesting to read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1056DLGDLDXLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060824972#wasThisHelpful","R1056DLGDLDXLJ","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Buried Life first introduced us to the underground semi-steampunk world of Recoletta. Cities and Thrones takes that world and expands it past the one city of Recoletta and exposes us to a few of the townships above ground and some of the other underground City States. Each has its own individual cultural feel to it that expands the world building well.Where The Buried Life was a who-dun-it with a little political intrigue involved, Cities and Thrones is much more of a straight political intrigue. It all seems to revolve around the hidden Library outside Recoletta. Factions either want to use it, burn it or control it. There are more mysteries to be solved involving the Library and why it is both wanted and feared by those in power.The major players from the Buried life are back as the dust is settling in Recoletta. Jane has found herself on the run and in a new city. She has also found an interesting way to be right in the thick of things all over again. Taking some of what she learned from Roman, Jane is starting to play a dangerous game as a novice spymaster engaging in cat and mouse antics as she acquires information in a new political intrigue.Roman, quite the spymaster is floating at Sato’s behest between the New Recoletta post Sato’s revolution and foreign states to solidify Sato’s reign in Recoletta. It seems he can’t get a certain former seamstress out of his head. Good thing they bump into each other along the way, bad thing that it appears they might be on opposite sides at the moment. But I don’t think that will stop someone as morally ambiguous as Roman. He still seems to be playing a lot of different sides at the moment and will always have multiple back up plans to stay alive.Malone has also risen into a play of power within the police force. The city is in a state of chaos and it appears that a few groups are out to snatch a bit of power in the upheaval. She is trying to find the source but has to team up with people she might not trust and make some decisions about which path she plans to follow.It took a little time for me to become drawn into the story for a couple reasons. First is that Jane was traveling for a while in the beginning before coming to her new home, there is quite a bit of set up to get to the new city. The other is that I don’t read a lot of political intrigues and so some of the nuances are lost on me, I was a bit bored with the set-up for that (totally a me thing just not into political maneuvering and such) I prefer it when bodies are being splashed around and it is more murder mystery than political thriller. But when things picked up in the story they really picked up and it was difficult to put the book away towards the end.The ending came together well and I was a bit surprised by a few of the developments. It left us in a place where the next book could go just about anywhere. I am really interested in the Library and all the secrets it seems to hold, I’m also looking forward to seeing what happens between Roman and Jane as I really want a little bit more time with them together, I crave the budding romance/flirtation between them and with where the story left off we have a bit of a cliffhanger happening. Looking forward to more revelations, more revolutions and more Recoletta in the next installment.Thank you to NetGalley and Angry Robot Books for the ARC in exchange for review","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YE7PKYI6SY2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857665537#wasThisHelpful","R1YE7PKYI6SY2R","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simon is a mess. He is a complete and utter disaster who seems to always do the thing that will get him into the most trouble or the most hurt. He was one of the most interesting characters of the disillusionists series so I was excited to get to know him a little better.  “Do you ever win?” she asked.  “I hold my own.”  When there’s no chance in hell. That was a kind of winning.  “Do you zing them with your recklessness? Dump it into them and make them go wild? Is that your edge?”  “Hell, no. I keep it all for myself.”  She snorted. “So that’s your special talent? Huge amounts of recklessness?”I can say that I know him better now and understand his obsession with recklessness. Simon has an interesting back story that I didn’t see coming, it was an interesting twist. I didn’t initially see he and Fawna hitting it off so well but they go from frenemies to lovers in 2.5 seconds. It was super fast but it seems that Carolyn Crane does have a tendency to escalate things quickly.Fawna was perhaps as interesting as Simon. She is a prisoner to her predictions and he was able to bring her out of that and show her how to spit in the eye of fate so to speak so that she wasn’t trapped by her gift.--  'It wasn’t just her—almost any time she told someone good news about his or her future, there’d always be that ‘but what about this…’ moment. Everyone kicked the tires. Happily-ever-afters belonged to people who couldn’t know the future.'They are a pretty good fit overall and maybe if the story was longer they would have had a slower building relationship but as is it goes really quickly.Simon is who he is and I’m glad he wasn’t ‘cured’ or changed at the end of the story. It wouldn’t have felt true to me if that had happened…he fell in love and it ‘fixed’ him. I like that he fell in love and did something even more reckless…because that IS Simon.This is definitely not a much read. It is a little uncomfortable in Simon’s head but if he was one of your favorite characters from the series it is fun to see where he ended up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7U745TGU94CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EAZRKC#wasThisHelpful","R7U745TGU94CI","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m not really sure what it is about this entire series but I got sucked in. The writing is good but not great, the plot has a few minor holes and sometimes the escalation/resolution of events is incredibly fast. But the story, the overall premise and the characters really carry this for me. Once I picked it up I had the hardest time setting it back down until it was over. Sometimes that is all you need in a book.  “I love you. I won’t stop waiting—”After the crazy ending of Double Cross I had to jump into this book immediately after. There was no time waiting, I needed to know how it would all end. It was another whirlwind ride start to finish and I totally enjoyed all my time. READABLE is the best way to describe the entire series.Justine has a tendency to bother me from time to time in the prior books as she waxed on in her inner dialogue. But in this book she is trying to reconcile her emotions with her knowledge and it was interesting reading how she was working out ‘the situation’ she is in. I actually enjoyed Justine much more in this last book as she finds herself.I do not want to give too much away because that is sorta the fun of this series. The surprise and resolution of it but it was totally interesting how Justine’s subconscious and emotions played into this story. Some of it is so dark and series so it is a good thing there is Shelby and Simon for some much needed comic relief. Mostly Simon though, he is hilarious in his absurdity.--  Simon wears a cape identical to Ez’s, but that’s where the similarity ends. His chest underneath the cape is bare, except for two crisscrosses of leather and one chain, allowing for yet another display of his many dragon tattoos. His black pants are shiny as can be, and his boots reach up nearly to his knees.  The bruises on his face from the impound-lot fight complete the insane effect.It’s what all the male bridesmaids will be wearing next season I’m sure. I love that Simon is so unpredictable and in his own way is being the best friend possible to Justine.The tension build up goes pretty well and I’m so happy that we finally get some tender moments from who was my team from the beginning #teampackard, because it was about time.But there are also sleepwalking cannibals still left to deal with, a bunch of serial killer copycats running around the city and a megalomaniac to deal with before anyone can have a chance at happiness.The Ending……well almost everything gets resolved. I still have a few minor general questions but I’m going to let them go because I really enjoyed the entire story. This book nicely rounded out the other two and I’m happy with the overall conclusion to the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TS42XMRLMB9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BDKTBK#wasThisHelpful","R3TS42XMRLMB9R","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"--'She couldn’t even say when she’d begun to hate herself; she’d lived with low-level self-loathing for a while. Lately it had gotten a lot worse. God! She’d crawl out of her own skin if she could.'Well I know when I started hating Sophia. I’ve never liked Sophia. I didn’t like her in Mind Games and well by the end of Double Cross I absolutely hate her. But I was hoping that she might find so sort of redemption in this novella. The thing is the hole that she is in is so deep that it might be a little insurmountable.Disgusted with herself and her life Sophia seeks out the Monk to disillusion her. The problem is that no one knows who the Monk actually is so finding him will be harder than she thought.Okay even after reading this and finding out about Sophia’s past I’m still not a fan of her but I do understand the motivations of her character a little more. The one reason to maybe read this is Robert and the Tanglelands. I loved the concept of this a structure that totally reflected the emotions of the creator.-- 'He and the Tangle became deeply connected. The Tangle lived and breathed, or more, Robert lived it, Robert breathed it, morphed it to match his undulating despair.'Robert makes Sophia a little more human to the reader and not just Otto’s puppet. It is interesting to see where her mindset is going into the final book of the series. While I still don’t like Sophia I did love the story of Robert and the Monk. It was an unusual and interesting expansion on the disillusionists world.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJYMMBP8VNKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMSTLHA#wasThisHelpful","R1SJYMMBP8VNKU","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about this series is that it is really readable. I picked it up and finished in a day, this book has the kind of angst that I really love. Not all silly misunderstanding angst but actual internal emotional angst and some deliver by the plot. The mix is done so well that I couldn’t stop reading. Neurosis as superpowers is a really great premise.The book isn’t perfect there are a few little/minor plot hole things and a few times I really hated being in the Heroine’s head but I’m supposed to feel uncomfortable in there. Juliette is a neurotic hypochondriac that tends to obsess over and fixate on things. When she does that to the extent that she drives herself into a frenzy I’m not supposed to feel okay about it, in that regard the author did a fantastic job.The Dissolutionists now work to reform some of Otto’s prisoner’s so they can be reformed and released out into the wild. The thing is that some of them might be innocent, specifically one of them who has the ability to enter dreams. Justine is having a severe crisis of conscience on that end. Should they really try to reform the prisioners? Is that their right? She also had the another problem she touched the dreamwalker and now she is connecting Justine’s dreams with Packard.  -- “I’m sorry I didn’t wait for you.”  Slowly Packard turns to me. “It’ll almost be worth it, just to see the look on Otto’s face when he finds out. You and me, conferenced into each other in dreams.”  “Why should Otto care? So she screws around in our dreams.”  “Dreams that she creates from our memories. She uses memories as her raw material.”  “So what?”  “Do you have any memories that you’d prefer not to revisit—with Ez and me along for the ride, experiencing everything from your point of view? Think of the experiences you’d most prefer to keep private. Those are the ones she’ll grab.”Well I can think of a few and I can’t wait to see them again. There is the semi-love triangle going on with Packard/Justine and Otto. I get it Otto is what Justine wants to want but I think we all know that Packard is who Justine really wants. I know I usually hate Love Triangles too but….This one works pretty well. There are some scenes that are a little uncomfortable because I’m not a fan of Otto at all but I get why Justine and her neurotic hypochondriac mind clings to the idea of him.--  “I can tell you this,” he says. “Otto may be the man the frightened little girl Justine fantasizes about, but he’s definitely not the man the brave, smart, grown-up woman wants—or needs.”This is not just about the romance though. HighCaps are being targeted and killed by a team of serial killers and the city is in a panic yet again. Justine is trying to keep both Packard and Otto safe as well as find out if the Dreamwalker Ez is innocent of the crime she was accused of. She needs to hurry the dreams are getting more intense and the soon Ez will have enough pull to make Justine help her even if she doesn’t want to.There are also all the fantastic side characters. I love Shelby and Simon they make this story so much better. Simon is the train wreck that you can’t look away from. It is like he chooses to do things he knows he can’t win or walk away from without getting hurt. He is bound and determined to push every envelope and every relationship to its max.--  ""This, of course, is pure Simon. Always taking chances. Always on the losing end. Which is why I’ve slipped out my stun gun. He realizes it seconds before I show it. He smiles, thinking about how to get to his, no doubt.  I say, “Don’t move. Just tell me where you have the descrambler.”  “I’ve taken precautions,” he says.  “You never take precautions.” We both know how this will end, but we have to go through it. “One. Two.”  He lunges. I press the button.Shelby always a true friend will always tell Justine how it really is and I love that about her. She doesn’t hold any punches and she always tells the truth.  ”… He was a momentary diversion for me, on my way to Otto, who is my ultimate perfect mate.”  “In other words, not real. Otto is fairy tale.” Shelby smirks at her own cleverness.  “Helpful hint—most girlfriends pretend to like their friend’s boyfriends, and act happy for them, or else they zip it.”  “Such a friend is useless. You and Otto, you comfort each other. That is all.”  “We fit.”  “Your fears fit.”This story was clipping along and was a good fun 3 star read for me and then the twist at the end came and the OMG WTF just happened bumped it completely up to 4 stars easy. It was horrible, it was amazing I felt so many things about it and there was no waiting to jump into the next book. I couldn’t stop to write a review first because I NEEDED to know how this entire story was going to play out.Warning: Have the final book ready to go because I can’t imagine that you will not want to read it directly after finishing this. So happy that this series was complete when I picked it up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OB5IUL7S944M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F3FJZA#wasThisHelpful","R3OB5IUL7S944M","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is it just me or does there seems to be a lot of UF/PRN series out there lately? Some I absolutely fall in love with from Book 1 and others seems to take time to warm to. SPI files has a lot of great ideas and I do like the world but had I not read Lucky Charms SPI 0.5 in an anthology with some other series I really like I probably would be calling it quits after this book. But I’m really hoping for a smidgen more in the overall arcs of the series and if I don’t start seeing it in the next book I’m most likely done because there are a ton of UF/PRN series out there lately.The Grendel Affair took a really long time to seem to find any forward momentum and at least that was solved in The Dragon Conspiracy. It starts out very interesting when some cursed diamonds linked with the Romanov family and Rasputin are stolen in the middle of a packed art gala. An event that every supernatural baddie seemed to be at so the list of possible suspects is longer than Vivienne Sagadracos’s tail (She’s a Dragon so that is long). Mak and Ian have an extremely limited time to find the stolen loot before it can be used for evil intentions on Halloween.Lisa Shearin has a better plot and pacing in this story. But it still didn’t have the magic that Lucky Charms brought to the story. But there is enough humor and plot tension to keep it going for the most part.  Grandma said that a skillet’s good for three things: frying chicken, baking corn bread, and going upside an obstinate man’s head.What it is missing for me is character chemistry. This series can’t seem to make up it’s mind. Are Mak and Ian flirty or friendly? Is he her bodyguard or partner? Do they have any chemistry or is it totally plutonic? I seriously don’t know and I’m not sure Lisa Shearin does either. If you would have asked me in Lucky Charms I would have said they will have a slow burn romance throughout the series, but right now I’m not sure one minute they seem flirty and the next like casual acquaintances not even partners who spend all their time together. The thing is I feel that way about all the characters in the book. No one has great chemistry together Mak doesn’t have a girlfriend she hangs with sometimes or a confidant in SPI that she tells stories too. The closest thing to a friend seems to be the dragon boss lady and that is a little awkward since you know boss, dragon and so much older than Mak. The two people who had the best chemistry in this book were actually Ian and Rake and they sorta hate each other.  “I don’t trust you.”  “That makes two of us. I don’t trust me, either. I do not take offense, Agent Byrne. Goblins get a lot of practice with distrust. If anyone ever does trust me, I must be doing something very wrong.”Do I need there to be some romance in the story???…not necessarily, but it really helps me at least. That said at least the plot and action kept the story pretty interesting even if I’m missing some of the other stuff. There is also the different lores involving Harpies, Dragons, Gorgons and Goblins. Who knew goblins were sexy and that pink is the most evil color to a goblin. I do like the lore change ups for the most part so far, they have been pretty imaginative.Mak is also not your typical UF/PNR heroine. She isn’t a badass able to kill things with a single bound. No she can see past illusions and it makes her useful but not the usual skill set of the lead in these. She doesn’t have any magic powers or a tragic past even. Still sometimes her insertion of southern etiquette while probably meant to make her endearing to the reader seems a little forced.The most interesting character in this book was Rake. He is a little walk on the wild side for sure. I’m all for cheering on the anti-hero and Rake seems to fit the bill but even he is changed. In Lucky Charms he was practically the bad guy and now he seems more like Mak’s own personal brand of kryptonite that is trying to use seduction to win her to his side.So overall Fun Book, solid interesting plot but wonky character chemistry. I enjoyed it while I was reading it, but I could totally set it down and walk away without withdrawals as well. So far this is a take it or leave it series for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2DS1AWIJGGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266923#wasThisHelpful","RT2DS1AWIJGGR","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just a basic scale without all the bells and whistles.  I bought it to replace a scale I previously had that tracked water % BMI and weight loss.  The thing is with all the fitness apps out there really I didn't need all the extras anymore I can just enter my weight in the app I'm currently using and it will calculate those things and graph them for me.  I personally use Lose It but I'm sure iFit and others are just as good.  I just need something that will weigh me accurately.This fits the bill I just have a few notes on it.  The first time you step on the scale it will be your weight + the weight of the scale.  I panicked for just a moment the first time I weighed myself.  No worries I was not almost 10 lbs heavier than I thought I was.  Another thing to note is every time you move the scale you should recalibrate it.  I think I've found a permanent home for it now so hopefully I won't need to do that very often, but if you change surfaces definitely recalibrate, it was a few lbs different when we moved it from tile to wood floors.It is a little sensitive and I had to work a bit to find a good standing position to get a weight that didn't jump around a lot.  I think this will be different for everyone the first few times of use but then it becomes habitual where to stand to get the best reading.It will show you the weight of the last reading taken but if more than one person is using the scale it is a little pointless.  I do now know my husbands weight every morning when I step on the scale.  So if it is just one person using the scale that is a good function, but useless to us.  There are no profile settings or anything like that so you can't differentiate between people using the scale.  Again not a big issue for us since I'm using an app on my phone to track those things.The tape measure that came with the scale was actually more useful than I originally thought it would be.  If you are measuring yourself without help there is a space to lock the tape in so that you can get an accurate reading all by yourself.  That is pretty nice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6CXINPNH640D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX0S4DC#wasThisHelpful","R6CXINPNH640D","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 StarsOverall Series – 3.5 StarsMark of the Tala - 3.5 StarsTear’s of the Rose - 3.5 Stars  But if it came to your life or mine, I’d choose yours.”Ursula’s tale is one of love and sacrifice, she has given more than anyone realizes for family and country.I love it when a story comes full circle and closes all of the threads nicely. Talon of the Hawk not only tells Ursula’s story but it also definitively closes up any threads left hanging from The Mark of the Tala and Tears of the Rose. By the end of Talon of the Hawk I think that all will agree that the fate of the Twelve Kingdoms and Salena’s daughters has been set and drawn to a great conclusion.I was really excited for Ursula’s story. She is the warrior daughter, the one that has always had the brunt of the burden of the kingdom and dealing with their father Uorsin. She is adept at handling him, giving just enough information and treating each conversation with him as a battle where she must dodge, parry, retreat and advance with great skill. Ursula holds a special place in my heart as I have a soft spot for women who wield swords, I blame Xena warrior princess for this . I just didn’t expect the betrayal of her father to have run so deep and the pain that Ursula dealt with to be so much. While it wasn’t particularly expected it did explain some of the excuses that Ursula made for her father.Ursula has returned home after defying her father and not bringing with her the son and heir Amelia birthed. As she enters the city she finds it is full of mercenaries hired by her father for extra protection. Uorsin is acting more paranoid than ever and his new paramour gives off a bad vibe as well. Ursula isn’t quite sure what to make of Harlan the handsome leader of the mercenaries. She also isn’t sure how she is going to get back out of the city to be able to help Amelia find her daughter or get through the border to Annfwn to find Andromeda either. So many problems and no one to rely on but perhaps Harlan can help her Ursula just needs to learn how to put her trust into another person, something she isn’t good at it, at all.There are really two parts to the story. There is the romance between Harlan and Ursula and then the journey to find Stella, reunite the Twelve Kingdoms and avoid a flat out war. I liked the romance and Harlan is a great leading man. I’m not sure why he is taken with Ursula from the beginning, she is combatant and exceptionally mean to him at times, but he takes it in stride and does everything he can to break through all the walls she has built around herself. He was patient and kind and I appreciated the way he helped her come to terms with not only her past but also with her role in the future.  ”Your people will look to you to save them in the days ahead. They love you. You are their hero—we all can see it.On Harlan’s end it was a little insta-love/lust but I liked how the story between them grew and took it’s time throughout the rest of the story.The second part is the great adventure of saving a kingdom from falling into war and finding a way to reunite all the parts. Even though this is Ursula’s story it wouldn’t be complete without Andromeda and Amelia. It is the bringing together of all of the sisters and the goddess each one serves to form a trinity of sorts that is bigger than each of them individually. I loved the time spent in Annfwn . It is such a magical place and I love the stories of Tala that live there. A world where people change into animals as part of a magical culture is just wonderful. Andromeda has really grown into her role as queen and become comfortable with the magic that lives within her. She and Ursula had different paths and finally could come to an understanding about those paths.  ”I found something that mattered.”  It stung. “Ordnung should have mattered to you.”  “You can’t force loyalty, Ursula. I never felt the way you did.”Reading about all the sisters together again was wonderful and I think that they came to have a better understanding of each other after each went through their own trials. The bonds of sisterhood between them are strong and by the end of the series I knew that each sister was fierce, bold and strong in their own way.It was a great world to visit, full of strong and wonderful women. Dafne and Jepp were a few of the favorites of mine in this book. Dafne is the logical, bookworm full of good advice, hard questions and intense loyalty. Jepp is the fun loving/deadly with a knife Hawk who will give any of the mercenaries a lesson or two in how to kill a man. She will also give them a lesson on how to *cough* play with *cough* a warrior woman off the field. I loved her adventurous and fun nature both on the battlefield and off.I found something special about each story and each sister. I’m totally satisfied with the conclusion to each sister’s journey and will probably visit the Twelve Kingdoms again sometime.Thank you to Netgalley and Kensington books for providing the ARC for review.

"My dog is getting older and is a little senile, a little blind, a little deaf and a little incontinent.  But she is my dog of 16 years and I love her.  We were having issues with her using the living room for a bathroom in the middle of the night.  We needed something that was easy to use during the night and while we were away from home but that wouldn't be a hassle to put up and take down.  I also didn't want to spend $150.00 on something either.This works perfectly for what it is.  It folds out a maximum of 9 ft for the 5 panel one I got and that is enough to cover the entry into my living room and only give her the option of going outside.  Also it folds up easily and pretty small so it will fit in a closet when not in use.  The wood is also untreated so you could stain it to match you living room or furniture if so inclined.  I also like that it can fit various size entryways so if needed I can put it in other areas of the house when I'm cleaning.  I've also found a way to trick my partly blind dog into thinking she can't get past it and showing the younger non-livingroom-peeing dog how to still get into the living room.This is for a small dog.  I have shih tzus which are 17-20 lb dogs if you have a larger dog this probably isn't going to work as it isn't very tall and could easily be jumped by a larger dog.  Also not going to be good for children as it is movable and I imagine a toddler could get in all kinds of trouble around it.For what it is it works great.  It was by far the best system I found that would work for me for under $60.  If you need something a little better constructed or secure this probably isn't the best product for you.  But if you just need something that stores well and will provide a barrier between your pet and an area of you house than I recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDXAAU1R1NTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003C5THR2#wasThisHelpful","R3QDXAAU1R1NTD","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog is going a little blind...and when I say a little I really mean a lot.  We were having issues with her not being able to find her way out of the bedroom down the hall and to the dog door to go outside to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  I'm so happy I found these since they are working out great.A few notes, I didn't like the sticky tape included in the packaging because it doesn't release so once you apply it you better want the light in that location forever.

I couldn't put one in my bedroom as just the comforter moving on the bed set it off.  Another reason to have the mounting strips since it might take a little time to figure out the best location.I like that the light comes on for about 15 seconds and then turns off.  This works perfect even for me as I stubble down the hall to the bathroom and now I don't have to worry about waking anyone else turning lights on and off.My only complaint is I wish I could adjust the motion sensor or that there was an on off switch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Y2UPV2SEU3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FCGI8Y#wasThisHelpful","R15Y2UPV2SEU3I","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 Why Don't I Love This StarsThis is one of my favorite series to read so it totally pains me to say ‘I didn’t really like it’. I’ve pondered my feeling about this for a few days now and there are a few things that I just can’t let go. Have you ever read a book in the series and wondered if you remembered everything from the previous book incorrectly? As we were wrapping up this book that is totally how I felt.There is one glaring thing that happens in this book and even after it is explained I didn’t buy it. I looked at my notes from book 7 and still didn’t buy it. It is one of those things that I either loved everything else in the book so much that you just let it go….or the book is just ho-hum so it is the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I’m so sad to say it was the later for me.BUT….I have loved many of the books in this series so while I didn’t like a lot of stuff in this one I will still read the next book. In a series this long there is bound to be one possibly two that I didn’t adore.❣ Some of the Good Stuff ❣Charley is still funny and punny and full of spunk. She has an A.D.D. quality that really makes me laugh and if you are at book 8 with me well then I’m pretty sure you feel that way too. There is still some fun dialogue and antics between her and the other characters.  “Do you need anything else?”  “Pitocin?”  One corner of his mouth rose. “What’s that?”  “It induces labor. It’s about time for Beep to move out. Cut her hair. Get a job. I need a flat belly.”  “Have you tried crunches?”  “I just don’t get it. I’m supernatural. You’re supernatural. Why can’t we have one of those quick pregnancies like Bella and Edward? Gwen from Torchwood. Scully. Deanna Troi. Or even Cordelia when that demon impregnated her. Twenty-four hours later, bam! Demon child.”The Chapter headings still always hilarious. --  My death will probably be caused by being sarcastic at the wrong time. – TRUE FACTThe side characters are always wonderful. I adore Cookie, Amber and Quinton. There are a plethora of others and Osh is becoming more interesting all the time.BEST PART OF THIS BOOK – I finally know who/what Mr. Wong is. I mean I needed to read eight books for him to finally do something but FINALLY, one question answered. There are a few more answered about the Army and the Twelve but honestly some of that was just confusing, I had a hard time picking out who was supposed to be who. That might have been done by the author on purpose so she could define them better later, but I read that area of the book multiple times trying to figure it out.I’m not entirely sure how I feel about the ending of this book. I both liked and hated it for practically the same reason. But…I hope that it leaves a really good set up for book 9 which I will definitely read but no commitments past that.☁ And now to Rain on the Parade☁I was a little worried about this because anytime you write a baby into a story you have a chance of becoming a little boring or losing that thing that made you character interactions great. Charley used to run around town solving crime and getting into all sorts of trouble. But that is really hard to mimic when you are trapped in a convent and 8  months pregnant. All the characters have to come to Charley since she can’t leave and even though everyone comes to the convent….and I mean everyone it just wasn’t the same.Charley still gets into plenty of trouble even when on the grounds but some of it just seemed stupid to me. I mean for someone who just had a baby she makes some very un-motherly choices.There was a ton of time spent being all lovey dovey. Reyes is totally to most understanding a puppy love husband ever. WHERE IS MY SON OF SATAN.....he just lets Charley walk all over him and get herself into dangerous situations with no consequences and not being really mad. GRRR….I miss Reyes of books 3,4,5 and 7. He seems like he went from a Wild Tiger to a housecat.There was a little situation that was supposed to introduce some contrived tension between Reyes and Charley but that ended up being nothing at all in the end. It was almost like D.J. changed her mind half way through and went a different direction in the story. I just didn’t even understand why it was even in there. Charley is keeping secrets from Reyes and Reyes is keeping secrets from Charley and both of them had stupid secrets to be keeping so I didn’t buy into it.The ending is a little jumbled some big revelations are made. I’m just going to say that I didn’t buy into the revelation with the Hell Hounds at all. It didn’t make much sense even after rereading my notes from book 7. Also who is who in Beep’s army was also not well defined as mentioned above, but I guess we definitely know who the 13th warrior to tip the scales will be. There was also the Denise of it. I’ve never cared for her but I also wonder about the timing in her plot line.I also don’t think I like most of the ending. Holding out final judgment until the next book though.∞ Hope for the Future ∞With how everything ends in this book there is a lot of hope for the next. The story might have a more clear direction for the future. Reyes might get to be a PoV because of what happened there at the end and all in all things might shake out for the better.I’m really hoping D.J. has a definitive plan and plot moving forward as I’ve enjoyed most of this series and I really hope my dislike of book 8 is just a fluke.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8F08XVBC6WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXID39K#wasThisHelpful","RF8F08XVBC6WL","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rick Riodan (RR) is one of the few M.G. authors I read, I mean I’m in my 30s so usually a M.G. book isn’t going to hold my attention but RR is one of the few authors who can pull it off and does it well at that. What makes him special???? Well there are a few things that I really like about his writing.① - He writes teens like teens. They aren’t 12-16 year olds who act like they are in their 30s they are kids, behaving like kids. Carter and Sadie argue like real siblings would and I totally enjoyed their interactions and teasing of each other.② - Action….Action….Action. Seriously there is always something happening. The stories move along quickly with chases, fights and discovery scenes everywhere. There are lots of clues along the way and some of them can be misleading until you get to the big picture of it all.③ - The mythology used is fantastic and so well thought out. I love RR’s interpretation of the Egyptian gods, magic and lore. There is a new interesting interpretation of them and how they interact with the world. It is new and exciting and I really loved how it was all shown and explained.④ - The magic and world building. I get so upset when reading a book and not understanding how powers work. I don’t care if it takes a little while to roll it out but I NEED to understand it. I want to feel like if I lived in this world I too could do magic. I’m still convinced I would have done as well as Hermione at Hogwarts if I got an invitation. So I appreciate it when authors incorporate learning how to use the magic in their story. After this book I was sure I could do the magic of this world if I was in it.⑤ - Interesting cohesive story and plotting that lend to a bang up conclusion. RR totally has a good voice and knows where his story is going. I never feel at the end that he has just thrown something in at last minute to fix everything. It is a fantastic trait to have in a story teller.There are a ton of reviews on this so I’ll just say Sadie and Carter were separated and raised apart after the death of their mother six years ago. But now through a series of events they are thrown together and must find a way to work with one another to save their father. With the help of a few unusual friends they must find ways to unlock the Power of the Gods (Egyptian ones) within themselves and try to save the world. Easy peasy….if they can quit squabbling long enough.If you add a few Gods, an albino crocodile, a cat named muffin, some spunky clay creations, a secret magical society and an orangutan with some special dietary needs together and shake you come up with one hell of a good time.I liked the Percy Jackson stories just a tad better but if you like mythology then this could be a great time for you too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWS6R258QYQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423113454#wasThisHelpful","R3NWS6R258QYQR","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 Who Else Could Want To Kill Harry StarsFive books in and the world and characters keep expanding a little at a time. I enjoy reading this series to a certain extent but the thing is Harry isn’t the reason. Mostly I like all of the side characters more than him. Each doesn’t get a lot of page time but the glimpses I see of them…well usually the side character steals the show from Harry, at least for me.It isn’t specifically Harry’s fault I mean sure he is a wizard with a snappy wit, pop culture references and a keen sense of humor in the face of danger but here is a list of the side characters that make an appearance.BOB - Although he is a little out of it this time and didn’t get his normal page time for banter the spirit/lab assistant to Harry housed in a skull almost always steals the show when on page.Micheal - *Swoon* I totally crush on The Fist of God. Good men are hard to find and he is the best of them. Anyone with a holy sword and Crusader Armor is interesting in my book.Molly - The Fourteen year old daughter of the Fist of God. She was hilarious, a little bit of a romantic and full of enough teenage rebellion to be interesting but not annoying she was one of my favorite new additions.“Ohhhh,” Molly said wisely. “Those are fun-time handcuffs, not bad-time handcuffs. I gotcha.”“No!” I protested. “And how the hell would you know about fun-time handcuffs anyway? You’re like ten.”She snorted. “Fourteen.”“Whatever, too young.”“Internet,” she said sagely. “Expanding the frontiers of adolescent knowledge.”Shiro and Sanya - Holy Crusaders and Michael’s equals Shiro is like the Mr. Miyagi of the book much knowledge and a great sense of devotion to his cause while Sanya is very different from what you would expect of a holy crusader of God.IVY - Also known as the archive. Imagine all of the world’s knowledge in a 7 year old girl. I’m thinking of the daughter in Dune, slightly creepy but infinitely powerful. I hope she shows up in future books as she was really interesting.“You know how to use magic?” I asked.“I prefer calculus.”“But you can do it.”“Yes.” Yikes. If the reaction of my wards was any indication, it meant that she was at least as strong as any Wizard of the White Council. Probably stronger. But if that was true… “If you know that much,” I said, “if you are that powerful, why did you hire a bodyguard to bring you here?”“My feet don’t reach the pedals.”Waldo Butters - Medical examiner who has caught on to the supernaturalness of some of the some of the corpses coming in lately. A little on the unusual side, I can tell I’m going to love him in this series.There are so many more including staples such as Murphy, Charity, Marcone, Thomas and Susan. There are some and new additions including the Oracle, Ortega, the Fallen and Nicodemus. So many people for Harry to interact with it gets staggering at times.While I really like most of the characters of this series I sometimes find the plotting kind of thrown together. It sometimes feels jumbled crashing together until we get to the end. Don’t get me wrong I’m entertained the entire time but I feel like I have a difficult time following parts of the plot occasionally.That said though Harry is an easy guy to root for even if the entire world seems out to get him and really it seems like the ENTIRE world IS out to get him.In this corner, one missing Shroud, one impossibly and thoroughly dead corpse, one dedicated and deadly vampire warlord, three holy knights, twenty-nine fallen angels, and a partridge in a pear tree. And in the opposite corner, one tired, bruised, underpaid professional wizard, threatened by his allies and about to get dumped by his would-be girlfriend for John Q. HumdrumSeriously, tell me that isn’t a lot to deal with. I will give it up to J.B. for the way he pushes the expectations of people’s roles in the story. Sanya in particular is a Warrior for God but…..he isn’t quite what you would expect at all. I loved the twist to his character. The inclusion of the 30 pieces of silver that were paid to Judas as well was a fantastic re-imagining of how to incorporate Christian lore into story. I also very much liked the addition of a duel between Harry and a Duke of the Red Court and how the rules for that were incorporated.There are a ton of great ideas in the story. Possible even too many which is why at times it felt slightly jumbled to me at times. Still right now this is a series I could read a few and walk away for a few months then read a few more. I haven’t fallen in love with Harry’s character enough yet to want to plow through 15 books before I move onto something else like has happened to me with a few of the other series I really love.Still Harry is a good dude to hang out with and go on a ride into crazytown. Also you can feel better about your life because I guarantee he has way more problems with romance, people trying to kill him and just paying the rent than you do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UCTSV218D7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451459407#wasThisHelpful","R7UCTSV218D7G","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"✬✬✬✬½ Overall Series✰✰✰✰✰ Angelfall✬✬✬✬½ World After✰✰✰✰ End of DaysEnd of Days took what I loved in Angelfall and World After and added to it some of the things I missed, more of the stuff I loved and gave it entirely new dimensions.A List of Awesomeness in End of Days:✔ - More Romance - OkayIwaswrong (totally sigh worthy trust me) and some YA hot fans-self worthy moments….hint rhymes with missing✔ - Weirder Imagery (who knew it could be done) it was disturbing and I will never think of hell the same way again.✔ - More Raffe!!! I missed him in World After – WE NEEDED more Penryn/Raffe banter time after World After.--  “Might as well fly into the heart of the enemy where the primitive natives can tear me to pieces, sell my body parts for money, and grind the rest to be consumed in teas for sexual potency.”I tighten my arms around his neck. “We’re not that primitive anymore.”He arches his perfect eyebrow at me, sending waves of skepticism.“We have Viagra now.”✔ - DeeDum antics including a Talent Show AND who would win in a fight between Godzilla and members of Penryn’s entourage. I know who I’d put money on.✔- Penryn’s crazy/not-so-crazy mother. Sometimes there is rhyme to her reason and other times…well you’ve read the other books so you know.✔ - #TeamFallen – I’m totally on the Fallen Watchers team.✔ - PAIGE - *sobs* that little girl has been through hell but at least Penryn isn’t afraid of her anymore.✔ - POOKY BEAR – is as epic and awesome as ever with a few new tricks up her sleeve.✔ - Redemption a character I thought unredeemable.✔ - Angel Elections a fascinating blend of democracy, fighting and survival of the fittest all at the same time.✔ - Crazy creatures and epic battles✔ - AND FINALLY – an ending that I really liked. not perfect I still have so many unanswered questions, but I’m really okay with how the series wrapped upEnd of Days starts exactly where World After ended. It is a crazy wild ride from beginning to end and I really don’t think I could have guessed how any of this would play out. Actually I did guess and I was SO SO Wrong, I don’t think a single theory panned out for me except for my one on little Paige.Susan Ee gave us some new and fantastical scenes from hell, she bridged new territory with her imaginings of the demon realm and I for one am in awe of it. Just when it got too heavy and too gruesome she tempered it with quick wit and humor to keep it from becoming overwhelming. Plus there was romance….shhhh I know I know, but I loved every touch, kiss and tender moment shared between our star-crossed couple.The only reason I deducted a star was there are a few things that either were ignored or didn’t wrap up or I still have a ton of questions about and was left pondering them well after I finished the book. THEY ARE ALL SPOILERS…..do not click on the tag unless you have finished the bookWARNING SPOILERS BELOW - read on at your own risk① - The immortal/mortal thing not even broached? Raffe totally still immortal, Penryn completely mortal so they get 50 – 60 years together and poof done. It wasn’t even really mentioned. Don’t get me wrong I love that he ended up staying on earth and SUPER LOVE that he took the demon wings back because seriously I thought they were way cooler. But that just seemed a little glossed over and under fleshed out. Layla sorta fixed Paige (vague description) couldn’t she also just randomly added something to Penryn for a little extended life mojo….just saying.Also the very end hook up was slightly cheesy…..or maybe that was just me. I wanted possibly a smidgen more on that front.② - What the hell happened to all the 666 creatures with their consumed heads? Do they still just hang out in our Ocean or did they go back to the demon plain with the Pit Lord?③ - Would Raffe and his watchers really have participated in the Blood Hunt to win? I really wish Penryn would have asked and that Raffe had a different plan in mind. That is quite a big thing to forgive if he was going to decimate all those humans.④ - The Nephilim – this is really my smallest thing. Susan Ee totally changed the lore and the Nephilim were harmless and just babies…no monster flesh eating tendencies. Now most humans have a little diluted angle blood in them. Hmmm….was that why Penryn could touch the sword she is a little small bit Angel.Mostly that is it. I gave up on the Raffe is millennia old and Penryn is 17 thing a long time ago so it doesn’t bother me…in my head with all of her mom crap and raising Paige she is easily the equivalent of 25. Nothing really bothered me so much that it diminished my overall enjoyment of the story.I really wonder if Ee is going to revisit the hellion realm or this world again in future stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SAP6FDB2ENUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477829709#wasThisHelpful","R2SAP6FDB2ENUZ","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ஐBeauty and the Beast meets Faerie ஐ – I should ADORE this but overall it was just okay. There are things I totally loved about this story, but they are marred by the things that didn’t quite work out for me and so what I’m left with is feeling in the middle where I didn’t love it but I didn’t hate it either.I’m a huge fan of beauty and the beast retellings or most fairytales actually, but Belle is my absolute favorite heroine because she is smart, reads and doesn’t fall head over heels for the first pretty face that happens along. She and I could totally be BFFs. Then there is the Fae. Now I’m not a big expert on faerie stories or anything like that, but I find the Fae to be totally interesting creatures and usually like it when they are incorporated into stories. Instead if this being a magical mashup that made the story soar to new heights of awesome I found myself seeing some serious sour notes that disjointed the story and made it feel clunky.The stuff I totally LOVED –✧ - Tamlin and his Faerie world - There are some really interesting descriptions of the time spent at the his manor. The lake full of starlight, the manor, the art and his court cursed to all be in masks. Tamlin is completely likable right from the near beginning.✧Lucien – He is a spunky guy full of vim and vinegar that Fayre has a lot of fun verbally sparring with and getting into general trouble. He is also a great friend to Tamlin and I love the brotherly bound between them. While Lucien has an easy way with people he is working hard to help his friend find the right way to woo Fayre.✧ The Love Story – I enjoyed the time Tamlin and Feyre were getting to know each other and the tentative flirting the best. I really wish there was maybe just a little more time spent on it as it was the basis for the last 40% of the book.“My father once told me that I should let my sisters imagine a better life—a better world. And I told him that there was no such thing.” I ran my thumb over his mouth, marveling, and shook my head. “I never understood—because I couldn’t … couldn’t believe that it was even possible.” I swallowed, lowering my hand. “Until now.”✧ The ‘Tasks’ – I like the idea behind completing some challenges to prove your worth and love. I liked even more that it was Feyre The Girl who had to do this instead of prince charming. It was a nice twist to a normal Fairytale.✧ - The Curse – while not particularly a fan of the fact the curse made Tamlin and his court all have to wear masks (since I really thought it would have been better if they all had to remain in animal form) I did like the final symmetry and cruelty of the curse. It was different and I totally respect that, it was a truly Fae curse in the level of cruelty behind it.✧ Rhysand – was my FAVORITE CHARACTER and I’ll totally admit I’m still not sure what exactly I think of him. I will say this though, he is the most interesting character in the book whether he is playing on the side of good or evil….well you will have to make your own decision on that. But I seriously hoping the next book is about him.As this is the start of a new series I will give it some leeway at getting started. There are some really fun parts to the story and even though it is a bit clunky at times I still got to a point when they are ‘Under the Mountain’ that I needed to get through the story to see how it all worked out and this is where the story mostly stayed on the like side of the line.The stuff that missed the mark:✦ - When writing about a well-established lore I think there are some things that perhaps the reader will ‘accept’ or ‘not accept’ based on how important or ingrained it is OR the story the author puts with the lore change. Based on my various readings there are a few things about fantasy creatures that are ingrained into me. I KNOW that➜ Vampires – Drink blood, Can’t be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heart➜ Werewolves – Silver bullets, Shifting (of some kind), Full Moon➜ Fae – Immortal Tricksters, CAN’T LIE➜ Zombie – Human dead, eat fleshI’m not going to say the Maas changed the Fae lore so much that she *Stephanie Meyer’d* it but she pretty much made a change to the Fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight.  It isn’t quite a deal breaker for me, but I’m not a fan of that particular lore twist either.✦ It pains me to say this but Feyre and I didn’t get along until about 75% of the way through the book. She does so many stupid things that honestly I went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with her.She began strong and independent with a family to support and I really liked that she wasn’t your typical virgin heroine. She hunted for her family and was the main supporter. Not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strong.After ending up in Tamlin’s court and promising to stay the first thing Feyre tries to do is escape, when Tamlin assures her that he has seen to her family’s comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again. She puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresome.“Weren’t you warned to keep your wits about you?” Tamlin snapped. “That your human senses would betray you?”He stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark. “Fool,” he said to me, turning. “If you’re ever going to run away, at least do it in the daytime.”I liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likable.✦The Curse –( Yes I know that it is up in the like part as well, you get +5 points because you noticed) - The story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly I thought it made Tamlin hotter instead of diminished. Masks are sexy I don’t care who you are just think about it Zorro, Phantom of the Opera, a slew of superheroes AND….The Dread Pirate RobertsTamlin had a beast form so I thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality. Just an opinion.✦The ‘Rite’ – There is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival. I’m not a prude I swear but it really bothered me how that played out. The whole scene made me feel a little strange and I really wasn’t sure what to do with my feelings about it. Maybe if I knew some other Fae stories and knew that was what ‘The Rite’ of spring was I wouldn’t have minded but I was not prepared. On a good note I was happy that it didn’t have any negative residual affects between Feyre and Tamlin.Overall Thoughts:Sometimes at the beginning of a new series you can’t see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you. I will say that when I read Throne of Glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then I loved both Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire. I’m hoping that is also the case with this series.Based on how the book ended I have some really high hopes for the next book of this series. If you like fairytale retellings or Faerie stories then I say still give this one a go. If anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is Maas so I’m not concerned and think she could be off to a solid start.Begs Sarah J. Maas to have the next book be about Rhysand and dare I hope for it..….Nesta","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HIAWZ5MBRM3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZP5VRS#wasThisHelpful","R3HIAWZ5MBRM3T","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'''WARNING: This is for mature audiences 18+'''After the cliff hanger stop point of the last installment I was more than ready to see how this would all play out. Hailey was after all in a pretty precarious situation and I was more than a little concerned for her.It starts out very intense as Cole is desperate to find where Hailey has been taken and get her back before she can be damaged. It was extreme and pretty dramatic there for a little while. But all and all it is resolved pretty soon and then we can get on to the hanky panky of it all…AND there is a lot of hanky panky.There is hanky panky all over the place and in every orifice….just saying. Cole is the epitome of a loving, caring and protective boyfriend. Sure he might do some bad things in his job but overall he is a nice guy.  “We’ve got our problems, but you’ve never been as far on the wrong side of right as you think you’ve been.”  I’m tired, and I ache in a million different ways. “That doesn’t make an ounce of sense.”  “It does to me,” Hailey murmurs.So Hailey and Coles relationship becomes a little saccharine sweet for me. He is everything she needs him to be for the most part. They work together to come up with a way to deal with the trauma of being taken and how to put Lively away for a long time.Everything wraps up well and I did like the HEA of it all. You can tell that there will probably be more stories from the Horus Group. Will I read them? I’m not sure. The sex is really hot and there is a lot of it so if I was just in the mood for that I’d maybe try another out but there are a lot of books like that out there so the jury is still out.The downfall to this serial is that the Title indicates the story is about one thing when in the end there was never really an angry/hate sex scene involved at all. I still liked the story but was a little disappointed by that one glaring fact.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZL0R0ZYV1VYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTP83LC#wasThisHelpful","RZL0R0ZYV1VYC","A1W1G846DJ5HFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W1G846DJ5HFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This blanket is freaking awesome!It is such a cute size, and has vibrant colors. I went with this Ivory version of the Chief Joe, and the oranges and greens stand out so much, I absolutely love it. I actually bought this for my dog to use while camping, lol. He loves it!, and it fits our lifestyle well.If rolled up it measures about 4 inches in diameter and a foot or so long, so it packs up nicely and unrolls out to  almost 3 feet by 4 feet. Works as a great ground sheet for him to lay on, or it it's cold, to cover up with.In time this will make a great piece of wall art.  You can't go wrong with these little guys.

"This isn't the brightest light out there but it is a good light.It's a quality build from Goal Zero, that is about the size of a Switch 8 if you're familiar with those.For $15 bucks you can't go wrong for a light that you never have to put batteries in. Throw this in your daypack and keep it there for when you need it. During the day clip it onto your pack and it will charge up while you hike.

"This is a cool little accessory for my Tuo Cub pad. It's a little big as if it was ""mainly"" made for the Astro Short pad, but would technically fit the Tuo Cub too.It does fit though, and provides a nice little washable sheet cover for the pad. Without this, the pad itself feels a little slick, like you could slide off of it easily. With this sheet cover, it gives you a little more traction and comfort of sleeping on cotton. It is thin enough so you can roll your pad up and leave it on, it still fits in the stuff sack the exact same way and size.It also adds a nice splash of color to your camp!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15N8RX01EO4OC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J1SVR0#wasThisHelpful","R15N8RX01EO4OC","AXYUV7EFQYKVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXYUV7EFQYKVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So yeah, these are great pants. I own all 3 colors at this point, and I do have to say that this Cargo version has a different and in my opinion, a better fit than the Non-Cargo original version of the Royce Peak pants.These pants provide the crossover I was looking for, being able to wear these to work, and go out a climb a mountain afterwards without changing. They are very comfortable, the fit and finish are spot on, and they come with some nice features. The gussets and articulation, the Omni-Shield tech is one of my favs (DWR), and nice pockets, which double as air vents if left open.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4TLXZSVPVEOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWNI6UU#wasThisHelpful","R4TLXZSVPVEOW","AXYUV7EFQYKVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXYUV7EFQYKVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sweet blade.The other reviewer may have gotten a defective knife and they should just contact Gerber for a free replacement, they would be happy to do that.I have had no such experience with mine, and it is rock solid. It has a very clean action, the blade locks in tight and I love every aspect of mine. I love the engraving on the blade, it will make for a good collectors piece. I have sent mine to my wife in the U.S. Peace Corps as an EDC. She carries it on her side everyday for utility and protection purposes.This knife came pretty much razor sharp out of the box and didn't need any touching up at all.

"Yeah it's $10 for a spoon, but wow...it's awesome.The polished bowl makes all the difference. I have used many other backpacking spoons before (Sea To Summit) and I can say that abrasive/chalky feeling when you eat with an unpolished one feels really weird after a while. They're certainly useable but weird in the long run. This one with the polished bowl is just that much better. It feels like a spoon from home but made with ultralight titanium and perfect for Mountain House meals. I mainly bought this to accompany my ""Jetboil Sol Ti"", while out and about in the backcountry or camping. It is a great addition to my kit and I stand behind it 100%!The orange pouch it comes with is a nice touch too, it fits in there all the way and has a funny ""foot"" logo drawstring closure and is nice for keeping the spoon clean and protected while traveling.

"OK! There is a lot going on with this knife, bottom line is it is badass and is very versatile.Keep in mind, this is not a heavy duty blade, this is not intended for abuse (though it may be able to take some), but more something to always be on your person for when you need it.First let me start off by saying that there are 2 Ghostrike Fixed Blade Knife options, the regular, and the deluxe kit. They are about $15 difference, so if you see 2 products that seem the same but have different prices, that's whats going on. One is just the knife, and one is the deluxe kit.This knife is ultralight for a full tang fixed blade, I believe it was designed to be as low profile as possible. A fixed blade your could have on your body at all times without noticing it. Great as an EDC knife in the backcountry for the minimalist, the way this is set up it will attract everyone from ultralight hikers and survivalists to tactical law enforcement and military. Most will use this as a backup, but some...will use this as a primary.The steel is 420HC which I know some people are not the biggest fans of, but man when you hold this, you will love it. Sharp out of the box, the grip is perfect, and it just contours right to the hand like it should. The sheath is a whole other story. The blade locks in with these 2 tension locks for left handers or right handers. Also it has these belt loops that can be adjusted to mount on a belt vertically or inverted, and also horizontally left or right...and it sits flush. That's the beauty behind it, I just love being able to mount it in so many different locations or variations. The deluxe kit comes with this awesome ankle wrap which is made from neoprene. The sheath mounts directly to the wrap and can be worn on the ankle and does not feel uncomfortable in any way (I have went on a hike already with it mounted there). It actually feels pretty bad ass, and looks cool too. I could see myself or anyone wearing this with shorts on at the beach or near water as a river/dive knife or wear it paddleboarding. It does have 2 drain holes at the bottom of the sheath for water to escape and feels locked in pretty well. It is designed for concealed carry and many will get this just for that concept. I believe this knife would be great for self defense situations, or for anyone who may not ever want to carry a knife on a belt This offers a nice mounting option as an alternative to just belt or neck carry. This can be mounted to MOLLE webbing and I currently have it mounted on the side of a Maxpedition Remora with two 3"" TacTies.The best part is the knife is made in Portland, OR. I believe many will get behind the Ghostrike and find many many uses for this versatile knife and all its mounting options. Highly recommended.I just don't know why Gerber didn't utilize the rest of the wrap that does not have the knife on it for ""other"" things...like an elastic sleeve for a mini ferro rod, or some tiny pocket for cash or whatever you may want to put in there. I guess its because it's part of the Gerber Tactical category, and not the Survival or Outdoor categories.Anyone with questions feel free to ask!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15K5NKNRG43G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMBY01C#wasThisHelpful","R15K5NKNRG43G1","AXYUV7EFQYKVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXYUV7EFQYKVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am surprised that there are no reviews of the Ghostrike Punch yet. This is a great little knife and well worth the buy.First off...this is made in Portland, OR. Made in USA, and is stamped proudly on the backside of the blade and on the outside of the sheath too! Love it. Secondly, this knife is RAZOR sharp out of the box. No need to do anything to it but put it where you need it and be ready for that moment. For as thin as this knife is it feels very comfortable in the hand and fits great in-between the index and middle finger, or in-between the middle and the ring finger. The rubber overmold is really nice and keeps the low profile the knife has gong on and provides excellent grip.Gerber says you can tie this down to Molle Gear with 550 cord, and I will vouch that although it may not look like it can be done cleanly, it actually does tie down to it pretty good. The holes on the sheath actually line up with a 3 high, 2 wide Molle configuration. I have mine tied to a Maxpedition Remora right now...it looks perfect. This knife has such a low profile, it is only 1/4"" thick including the sheath. It mounts completely flush with whatever surface you mount it too, or if you choose to toss it into a pack or kit, it would be hardly noticeable at all. This thing can be worn as a neck knife, strapped to a belt, tied off to Molle (or anything for that matter), there are so many mounting options. It can go into the sheath lefty or righty, vertical or inverted...I could go on and on about this knife but the bottom line is, it's an awesome piece of kit. I intend to use it primarily as a backup blade in or on my Remora. It is a quality knife, made here in USA, and you will love this little guy too when you buy one.Highly recommended to anyone into tactical gear, being prepared, minimalists, ninjas, or people that walk their dog late at night...","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXU69M7WHDDGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9Y7A02#wasThisHelpful","RXU69M7WHDDGH","AXYUV7EFQYKVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXYUV7EFQYKVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own all 3 of these and use them with some of my other Insect Blocker gear from Columbia. I will say they look and feel like a typical bandana but have the Insect Blocker tech in them. I recommend washing them once before using them to make them feel more comfortable.The IB tech works just fine like the rest of the lineup but the main reason I bought these was for my bulldog to tie around his neck while hiking to offer him some relief from bugs and things like that.

"First off, this is Dakine! Enough said...Second, it is made of great materials, YKK zipper, and the ""Hood"" color scheme is awesome, I have almost the whole collection. This sleeve fits my Kindle Fire HDX just fine. It actually has a little breathing room inside both ways, and even with an OtterBox case on the Kindle it fits perfectly. All in all, I couldn't ask for a better little sleeve to protect a small investment like the Kindle, and for $8.00 there's not much to complain about.PS. The other reviewer on here, should have checked the dimensions of his equipment and of the sleeve before hand to make sure the Surface would fit. Being a Tablet/Laptop hybrid design, one would assume it would fit, but that's what you get for chancing something. No big deal though, Amazon has free and simple returns too. I should also mention that Dakine sells a designated ""Laptop Sleeve"" as well, and the reviewer should have chosen that one over the ""Tablet Sleeve"" in the first place.

"I ordered two of these, black small and black medium. Just did a trial run with these on a quick frozen mile. They performed fantastically! The medium's I got for myself fit me perfectly in my size 9 Timberland's. My wife's size 6.5's fit perfectly in the small's.We both loved the performance these Microspikes provided. They were even quite comfortable to wear on ice or gravel trails.

They offer a tote bag, for an additional $10-15, but I like a bunch of other reviewers agree that the tote should be included with the purchase of the Microspikes.Product came out of Backcountry.com, and was sent with free 2-day UPS shipping.

"So I got this for recovery purposes as well, like other reviewers on here, except it works for me...It has a 4,000lb limit, my Suzuki SX4 only weighs 2,900lbs.

"So first off, let me say I ordered this with my Prime account, and it comes with free 2-day shipping...it got here in 1 day. I immediately took it out in the frontcountry for a day hike with the dog to give it a test in the field.We made it to a nice frozen shoulder of the Rattlesnake Creek in Missoula. The temp was below freezing, i'de say 20-30°F, or somewhere around there. I chipped through an ice shelf on the creek and dunked the bag into the ice cold water. Filling it was easy with the current but I can see some wishing it came with a bigger bag because it doesn't look like much when the bag is filled. I use a 32oz Platypus bag I have, and carry the included 16oz bag as a backup! Anyway, I screwed the filter onto the bag, tipped it upside down and water came out with a very effortless squeeze. After I got done laughing about how simple this was, I gave my boy Yoshi a drink as well (my English Bulldog). He also took to it well, as he's a big fan of drinking from water bottles anyway. So yeah, this is a dog friendly design!Also out of curiosity I affixed the straw directly to the filter and drank directly from the creek and it was quite easy to do. The amount of suction required was similar to drinking a milkshake, and the flow rate was surprisingly great. At that point one can either shake the filter free of the water still inside the filter, and/or blow through it providing the same effect. (I should note that if using this in freezing temperatures, to prevent the filter from freezing after use, you will want to keep it on or near your body's core).When I got home I did the back flush with the syringe twice, and the thing flushed perfectly. This thing was a piece of cake to use, and was exactly what I was looking for to carry in my Heli Pack. I would recommend this filter to anyone!...and for $20, you cannot beat this. Plus you get a bag, straw, and syringe with it. Buy one now!Anyone with questions, feel free to ask/comment. Glad to help.UPDATE: After 18 months of steady use, this thing is still running strong! I have also come up with a cool addition to this water filter...I removed the sticker on the white middle section and I have replaced it with about 5 feet of standard width 1.88"" DUCT TAPE! Using the filter AS the spool for the tape, allowing this filter to be a multi-purpose device. Some people will carry duct tape with them as a emergency repair kit, but we all know duct tape has a million uses, it's the cousin of paracord practically. Trust me it is cool, with the duct tape wrapped around it multiple times, the tape will eventually be flush with the filter end caps and not look sloppy at all. Plus it's a cool way to personalize your filter with a color or pattern to match your kit. If your a little picky like me, I didn't exactly want a ""blue"" item with my stealth gear. Anyway, this method allows you to carry a decent amount of duct tape spooled around an item you are already carrying, and not taking up ANY extra space than the filter already is using inside your kit.Why not carry some...it might come in handy sometime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKR6JLBDFFRAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FA2RLX2#wasThisHelpful","RKR6JLBDFFRAG","AXYUV7EFQYKVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXYUV7EFQYKVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why these things are not being produced like they were last year, I have no idea...but they are freaking awesome.This could possibly be the perfect dog bowl for backpacking/hiking if you are already carrying a backpack. Which was my sole purpose of buying them. However, they were noticed by my fiancé who is going into the Peace Corps, and said they would be perfect for that scenario too.

"Just got the bag in the mail today, I ripped it open like it was x-mas and hopped inside.I can relate to what ever other reviewer has said and everything is true about this bag. I had done a significant amount of homework before purchasing this bag and for good reason, it costs $369! BUT, I would say it is worth it, especially when I used my REI 20% off member coupon that brought it to $295, and I had a gift card or 2 that brought the price down quite a bit more for me.I was so excited to get this though, this was my 1st down bag ever. My biggest concern was would it compress down enough to fit in my Osprey Volt 60's designated sleeping bag compartment. The packed dimensions say this measures 17""L x 9""W, which is true in it's included roll-top stuff sack. The rough dimensions of my sleeping bag compartment in my backpack was 12""W x 9""D, and Compressed, this bag fit with room to spare. I hand rolled this bag up as tight as I could get it, and it measured 5"" wide by about 14"" long. The bottom line here is the chances are if you are wondering if it will fit into any specific area of your backpack, you will be able to manipulate it to fit in there somehow. Very compact, and able to compress down alot!With that I should mention that it ""lofts"" up really well to!I wanted to see it in my tent (Nemo Espri LE 3P) so I pitched it quick in living room, and threw it in there for a quick glimpse of how it would look, looks good in there. I also threw a pad (Nemo Tuo Cub) inside the bag just for a quick reference and it was to big for a 20""W pad. Definitely need a 25"" Cosmo pad to really give it that loft it can handle. Can't wait for that.The materials feel great, the zippers are nice YKK, and the pillow pocket is a nice touch too! I am roughly 5'8"", and I could get lost in this bag. I even had Yoshi, my english bulldog (65lbs) hop in the bag with me and I was able to zip it closed with both of us in there, and still had room to breathe.Nemo is going to release the Mezzo Loft in 2014 which is a synthetic fill bag, so if the price is the only thing holding you back, you can wait till next year and there will be a little more affordable PrimaLoft version, but if you want the packability of down for backpacking, this is your bag.Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R136YDAKHNLMMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN9YE7M#wasThisHelpful","R136YDAKHNLMMQ","AXYUV7EFQYKVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXYUV7EFQYKVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, I just got this little guy, i'm a big Gerber fan and BG fan.This axe feels great in your hand and was very sharp right out of the clam package. Yoshi and I immediately went out to field test it. We built an impromptu debris shelter with it and I was very impressed! I was able to hack through 3"" branches with a half dozen swings or so, and 1""-2"" ones with just a few swipes. The edge held up nicely and was just as sharp after the shelter build than before we started.I haven't gotten into any of it's finer carving abilities yet but I do not doubt it one bit.I have a Heli pack that I always carry into the backcountry and my pack seems to have a sleeve that fits it perfectly it even allows you to carry it without the sheath if you want. Which is the only reason I took off a star in my rating. I wish the sheath was a bit better quality or a different style. Yeah, you can wear it n your belt, but...I just wish as much effort went into the sheath as the hatchet itself. There could be a ferro rod incorporated and/or even a field sharpener. Maybe Gerber will come out with a PRO version down the line with updated materials but for now, the axe is sweet and that's what really matters.Glad I bought this one, good solid piece of kit here!

"First off, holy s***...$14.00?!?!WOW. I almost bough 2 just for the h3ll of it.Anyway onto the actual sleeping pad. I had never bought a Nemo pad before, and this was a really cool opportunity to buy one and just test out the quality and see what everyone has been talking about. For $14.00 why not.Size: I actually will end up using this for my dog while camping since it is sized on a 2/3 scale and my dog happens to fit it well. When I lay on it, 5'8"", everything from my mid-thigh/knees down are off of the pad. Though that is the point of the short pad. The short pad allows your hips/butt, back, shoulders, and head to sit on the pad. The concept is to potentially conserve weight that not needed all the time.Quality: The feel of this thing is top notch, like every other Nemo product. It feels better than some other ones i've seen on display at REI before.Setup: This is so easy to use, it comes in a nice drawstring cinch bag, then a velcro strap is holding the rolled up shape in place, undo the strap, roll it out, open the 2 valves and 3 breaths into each valve fully inflates both chambers. You can then drain some air from the top chamber if wanted to fine tune any sort of soft/firm-ness. It will also deflate and roll/pack up just as easy, in less than a minute.Comfort: Ok, so since this pad is only 1.6"" thick, don't get the impression that it is a mattress. It's a thin pad mainly designed for insulation from the ground...with ""some"" comfort factor. If anyone is looking for more comfort than insulation, go with an Astro/Cosmo pad. Anyway, laying on this pad is MUCH better than laying on the ground without it. It's actually quite comfy due to it's 2 chambers. I could see this pad being a cool thing to have in the bed of a truck too, deploy it when you need it.I would definitely recommend this pad to anyone, and wow for the price this pad is crazy. I should also mention that even though the notes or product info state that no matter what shipping option you choose it will take a week or whatever. I ordered this with my Prime account and it got here in 2 days. Just an FYI.

"I use my Heli Pack 11L as an EDC in the backcountry.For me it's the perfect low profile pack that carries my 10 essentials. Not to mention the ability to carry a snowboard!I usually carry a canteen w/cooking cup, survival knife, a medical kit, tinder kit, a few emergency items, and a packable fleece or something similar. I do have the 2L hydration reservoir specific to this pack too, I just do not always use it. This pack stays in my trunk all the time, and whenever I get out, I put it on my back. Ya never know!Also Dakine's quality is awesome, affordable, and they tend to have creative color scheme's. The waist belt is fixed, and the sternum strap has a rescue whistle buckle which I think is a nice touch, that every pack these days should have. The ""insulated hydration sleeve"" is a cool feature too specific to the 11L, not the 20L.

"Wow, this is my new favorite knife!A rugged Post-Apocalyptic ECD, just like Gerber said it would be. For the time being I will use this as a Pre-Apocalyptic EDC!Rick Grimes has this knife in a Modified Clip Point version, and he seemed to really have alot of fun with it. So I wanted to give this one a shot in the Tanto. I may have to get the other one too after playing around with this, it is just that nice. Might be cool to have one of each blade type so you can carry the same knife for different situations.Wicked sharp right out of the package. Just touch that Tanto blade to paper and it melts right through it.The weight of the knife feels great. Some say it's too heavy, but I say it's just built well. There is metal all inside the handle to support the pommel and locking mechanism. Everything feel 100% secure. You will love the way this beast feels in your hand!Some people have stated that they can not open this one handed and will need to pry it open with both hands...I was able to open this one handed immediately (very easily in fact), and if you have the right wrist flick you can open it without using any thumb studs at all. The action is so clean, you'll almost get addicted to opening it. I haven't had a knife that made me smile this much ever.I wasn't sure on the ""wedge lock"", as I have never had a knife with one, but I have to say I like it alot. You don't ""need"" to pull both sides down at the same time but you can if you want. (A cool little fun fact that I found just from playing with it is, if you depress the wedge lock with your thumb, you can give a gently but firm wrist flick and the blade deploy's as fast as the AUTO version). It's really cool, never had a knife I could do that with.Some people have also mentioned that they don't know what the blade steel is, and just say, ""must be Gerber's mystery steel. Well for anyone that does want to know, the new one I just got has that info right on the packaging and states that it is 7Cr17Mov! Which in my opinion is not bad at all. In fact it is better than I thought! Which for those that don't know, it is a really good middle of the road steel type. 7Cr17Mov is equal to 440A. (Which means: Daily use where corrosion resisitance is desired over long term edge retention). Nice huh? Better than most actually.The added angled pommel is a nice touch too, I could see this coming in handy at some point down the line. Glass, faces, etc...lol.The G-10 scales on this thing resemble a carbon fiber weave, and they feel pretty good in your hand. The finger grooves fit the average hand nicely and there are also some decent jimping on the backside...nice touch! Man what a solid grasp on this thing.This is my first Tanto, and I have to say, yeah I f'n love it. Can't stop playing with this knife.Also, the clip feels and is very sturdy and I have to say I love the new Gerber logo's!For $40 I think this is a steal and would recommend it to anyone looking for a rugged EDC. Good job Gerber on this one.

"I have had one of these for 15 years and loved it. I bought another after I lost the original velcro shoulder straps and it started to wear out.This holster has a lot of room for adjustment, to get the perfect fit. You can wear it lower or higher to your liking. I've had to maneuver mine a little so that it doesn't rest right against my rib cage, but after a little finessing, it tucks in perfectly. I can wear this all day with a light shirt and not worry about imprinting. It will hold a Glock 26/19 and multiple spare magazines.  You can throw it in the wash (on cold, hang dry) to clean it and it will last for over a decade. Simplicity, service and function.One caveat; it's a DEEP conceal, meaning it's not made for quick draw. If you need/want fast access; this isn't the holster. It's going to sit under a layer, deep under your armpit and may be secured with a velcro strap. Fast access is not it's purpose, so know what your need is.All in all, I give it top marks for use and durability.Please check yes below if this was helpful.

"It's a well made holster designed perfectly for the Glock 26. However I had a few issues with it.Firstly, if you're looking for a true concealable CCW holster, this one is still a little too bulky (at least for me). I'd have to wear a large over shirt or jacket to avoid imprinting with this holster. The convenience of the magazine pouch, does add bulk that makes it more visible. That being said it's well made, sturdy and the clip has enough power to hold well.The clip was my second issue. Weirdly enough on 2 occasions I pulled the bottom of the clip out to slide it over my belt and the metal was so finely shaved it immediately cut me. To the point, my wife asked why I had blood on my shirt. It's razor sharp. I'm a young guy, in good shape and not on any blood thinners, so nay sayers'; it wasn't my fault. The clip is just shaved too thin for it's purpose. Maybe mine was an aberration as the reviews of this product are pretty good (reason I bought it). But be forewarned.All in all, a good holster depending on your need. I went with a tried and true Blackhawk inside the pants holster, which has a much slimmer profile and a deep concealment shoulder holster. Both of which work perfectly.Please check yes below if this was helpful to you.

"Great Look and Sound: Absolutely terrible fit and install: I've installed these on multiple bikes but for the softail; they are terrible. The exhaust mount bracket is snug up against the swing arm and very difficult to get to. Vance and Hines did not weld the nuts onto their exhaust, so you've got to try and get the bolt and nut into a tiny space. It's too tight for almost any tool, including open ended wrenches. It's an absolute nightmare. This would have been so much easier if they welded the nut in place like the stock pipe.Just be warned. If I was doing it over, I would not buy these. I'd buy a different pipe or a full system simply because slip on install shouldn't be this difficult. They are typical Vance and Hines finish and sound. Excellent, loud, throaty sound. Just not worth the pain.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASTYNHWPSLN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FG9J6BY#wasThisHelpful","RASTYNHWPSLN7","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this frother and the Aeroccino Plus. I use one at the office and one at home and have had them over a year. This one performs much better in my opinion. It's taller and narrower than the plus and doesn't have a handle, however the frothing is much smoother and more consistent. I've used this with whole milk, 2%, Almond Milk and Silk. Without the mesh whip it delivers a creamy froth and a fair amount of whipped foam. For me it's the perfect amount. With the mesh whip attached it produces a full amount of cappuccino style foam and less cream.Having used both for over a year, I can say they are both good, reliable and a required addition to any home latte/cappuccino system. I would take the 3 over the plus. I'm not sure why Nespresso and stores package the plus and push it, being it's the older model.Maybe they have an excess of stock? Both are easy to clean, reliable and consistent. Both are fairly quick, completing the whip silently within 2-3 minutes (depending on amount). This combined with my Nespresso has completely changed my coffee drinking. I love making Latte's at home and have cut my store bought coffee drinking by 2/3.  This frother is an essential part of that package.[...].

"I installed this on my 2015 Forty Eight with a Screaming Eagle Stage 1 air cleaner and Vance and Hines 3 inch slip ons.It's so easy I wouldn't even consider it an install. Plug it in, turn on bike done. It immediately connected with my iPhone. I was able to originally select stock HD pipes and high intake air cleaner. The bike immediately ran a little smoother and cooler. This was great since the bikes (especially in CA) come extremely lean from the factory to meet emissions standards. Just upgrading your stock bike with the fuel pak will help it run richer (cooler) and smoother.After I installed the new pipes, I upgraded it selecting the exact V&H pipes, high intake air cleaner and uploaded a new map again. Bike runs smooth through the gear range, has quicker acceleration and sounds incredible. The Fuel Pak made it easy and saves you $150-200 you'd pay each time the dealer flashed the map.I leave the FuelPak installed and am able to see everything on the bike in real time.  You can see intake temperature, operating temperature, spark, fuel economy etc.  Download the app and check it out in demo mode. You can see everything it has available.  I haven't used the autotune (don't need to) but it's simple and comprehensive if needed. You can also go in and individually adjust the map parameters if you're so inclined, but I don't need to and don't have the level of knowledge to make individual decisions. But the flexibility is there if you need it.This or the Powervision Dyno jet? Both great units. The Dyno jet has some additional features. You may have to call them and give them your specs to download a specific map. But you can load custom maps from other sources into it. You can leave it attached to the bike, but you'd have to mount it on your handlebars. Dynojet is operated through it's screen, while the V&H is through your phone app (which is more convenient to me). The dynojet is a little more complex and flexible, but also not quiet as simple or accessible. Depends on your need. For more advanced programming and/or racing probably the dynojet. For casual riding, regular use and ease; I like the V&H. The only 2 downsides I think to the V&H Fuelpak is the lack of brands represented in pipes (i.e.; V&H, Roland Sands, etc).  If you have Bassani, Cobra etc, you'd have to either call V&H and they will tell you which map to use, or use a base map and autotune. Both acceptable and easy, but it contributed to my decision to buy the V&H pipes. Just easier.  Second is inability to load custom maps. Ie; you can't download a map off the internet and load it, if that matters to you.Overall; excellent product, well designed, easy user interface, reliable and typical Vance and Hines quality. Couldn't recommend more highly.  [...]. Thank you!.Update: 08/09/15: I added this unit to my 2015 Harley Softail Fat Boy. I had the same easy experience. I used the AutoTune on the FatBoy and it worked well smoothing out acceleration and riching up the engine. It works as advertised, very simple and very effective. Secondly; I installed hard bags on the FatBoy during which, I dropped the fender. Unbeknownst to me; the FuelPak slipped through a crack down in front of the fender. I recently went to remove it after AutoTuning to discover the accidental ""relocation"". It was bent, seared (from contact with the motor) and the case was cracked open. I about had a heart attack. I snapped it back together, used electrical tape to close it back up and plugged it in. Works perfectly.Full and complete acknowledgement to Vance and Hines for making a very durable, tough, Harley worthy product! It literally took a beating, burning and cracking and keeps on ticking.

"I put these on my wife's 2015 Forty Eight. They look great. The fit and finish is very high quality. The matte ""denim"" black perfectly matches the stock Harley denim black on the header heat shields. The were fairly easy to install. The only challenges is the stock muffler clamp is barely fits the V&H pipe. I used a rubber mallet to tap it in place and it worked perfectly.  This was about a 45 minute install, including aligning the heat shields.They sound great. Absolutely great. A word of warning, these are loud pipes. I expected them to be quieter than the Vance and Hines short shots. I'm not sure they are, they're very close. So if you're looking for quieter you'll need something different, or you'll have to try the quiet baffle.  That being said, obviously if you want loud, they are much easier to install than the short shots and look great.I paired mine with a Screaming Eagle stage 1 air cleaner and the Vance and Hines Fuel Pak (separately reviewed).  Excellent combination. Great sound, excellent torque, bike is smoother through the gear range and it runs richer (cooler).Overall we couldn't be happier. Sound is great, look is excellent, fairly easy install.  [...].

"A can't live without. I've referenced this for multiple repairs/upgrades in the first 5 months and it's been incredibly helpful.  Although some descriptions are generic across different years of different sportsters; it's mostly spot on. The images and descriptions have saved me a few times from making a mistake, or missing a small, critical step.  If you wrench on your bike, you must have this.

"I use an Xbox, Apple TV and computer streaming. I thought the Fire Stick would be a good way to consolidate some of that streaming and be able to take it with me when I travel (which is frequent for work).  The Fire Stick has proven to be a simple, easy, fast way to stream. I couldn't be happier with it.It has a small form factor and the remote is small (er than the Roku), which I like.  Plugging it in and following the directions was incredible easy and took less than 4 minutes to log in, select settings and watch the tutorial.  It took a few minutes to put in my passwords for Hulu and Netflix etc. I used the iPhone app which made this process much easier, since I could type answers using the keyboard vs selecting single letters with the remote.Some people may not like that Amazon puts it's menu content front and center, but that seems a minor thing.  If you are a control freak and want to adjust every position of the menu, you may be disappointed. I found it cleanly laid out, intuitive and quick to navigate.Video quality is excellent. Shows start quickly (with Amazon content starting near instantaneous) and are clean, bright, crisp 1080p (depending on content of course).  The audio is equally excellent, streaming in 5.1 surround.Ease of use, speed, quality and function, this is an excellent product.  Why did I choose this over Roku? 1) I don't like the big, clunky outdated Roku remote. 2) Spec wise the Fire Stick has a more powerful processor, faster speed and more memory. While only a negligible difference now, as the 2 products update (and they do, my Fire Stick updated as soon as I plugged it in), the Roku will possible start to slow down. 3) I stream a lot of Amazon Prime and this is incredible fast/easy with the Fire Stick. 4) It came with an HDMI extender, Roku doesn't 5) I like the Amazon app better than Roku's. 6) I like then clean black form of the Fire Stick. Simple and it virtually disappears.[...].

"Firstly; my wife and I are huge coffee lovers. We spend a few hundred a month on Starbucks, CB&TL and Peets (sadly). We've used keurigs, the Vue and other home pod systems. We were looking for a coffe maker that 1) makes good espresso/latte 2) makes good coffee 3) doesn't require massive clean up and 4) doesn't cost $1200. This one beats all I've tried and meets all the criteria.I'd held off the Nespresso because you have to order the pods and it didn't make regular cups of coffee. Both issues solved. Firstly local boutiques sell the pods and you can order them through the Nespresso app & Amazon with a 2 day delivery. The Virtuoline makes regular coffee. Sweet!About the machines;The Virtuoline is completely reengineered. It takes a bar coded pod (which the machine reads), spins the pod at high speed while injecting over 19 bars of pressure. The result is a very creamy (Crema) coffee or espresso before you even add creamer/milk. Works exactly as they advertise.The Aerrocino plus is my new favorite toy. Somehow it froths milk into either a creamy blend or whipped froth (depending on which whip you use). My wife loves a foamy cappuccino and I like creamy latte's. It delivers every time. Coolest thing, one touch button and go. Simple and consistent. If you want to control the temperature, hear the steaming sound etc and then have to clean the nozzle everytime; you'll want a full espresso machine (ie pay 3 times as much and do 3 times as much work).Pros;* easy to use. Everything is literally 1 touch button.* Easy to clean. Auto eject pod, rinse milk frother. Done.* great performance: cream/milk frother; perfect!* Excellent espresso; vacuum sealed perfectly roasted coffee beans ground and pressurized.* Impressive Crema both coffee and expresso* Well made, heavy duty components.* Good selection of espresso and coffee* Superior customer service* Cost vs other options.Cons;* regular coffee (not espresso) is a little watery (but flavorful) if you don't short the cup at about 6 ounces.* lack of ability to customize, options (if you really want to meddle)* ordering pods* separate milk frother.Summary;This is an absolute keeper. Meets all my needs, is affordable, doesn't require a massive cleanup every time you make an espresso and delivers consistent delicious coffee. Worth waiting for![...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4J7ZTMI5E98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILLV46Y#wasThisHelpful","RM4J7ZTMI5E98","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a casual enthusiast that travels a lot and wanted a comfortable bag that holds my camera gear, some other gear and an iPad.I returned the canon camera backpack and bought this one. The main 2 reasons; access and comfort. The canon forced the heavier items higher on the pack, which pulled causing soldier strain eventually (FYI I'm 6'0 and fit, so not a physical issue on my part). Also I discovered I really wanted to be able to have side access. Nearly every other backpack I compared required you to take it off or sling it oddly around your waist.I love this Tamrac. First, it's sturdy, well made, has solid zippers, a reinforced flat bottom and a great layout. The camera and heavier components sit low and close to your back properly distributing weight. It's easy to adjust the gear customized inside so that with an easy left or right swing you can access the fear and change lenses. I can't tell you how much better this is. You don't appreciate it until your in cold weather fiddling with your gear, gloves and zippers (my trip to DC).Positives;  * great layout with dual side access  * Sturdy construction, good zippers and specialized pockets.  * comfortable to wear, adjustable padded straps  * sits upright on flat bottom  * fits up to 2 iPads or notebook  * included raincover  * completely customizable and expandableCons;  * price (worth it though)  * less waterproof than other tamracs  * not a great tripod attachment (if u need that)Overall a great versatile backpack with excellent side access, durability and function.[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLXKG6ELKM2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004USLWUA#wasThisHelpful","R2LLXKG6ELKM2A","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Casual hobbyist photographer.I used this lens recently in DC outdoors and in the Smithsonian. Amazing! It was great for portraits out side and capturing some beautiful depth of field shots of memorials, reflections etc. Color, clarity and depth are beautiful. I shot mostly at 2.0 or 4.0. I can't get over the elegance of the photos!The only downside is the motor. It's not STM so you'll hear it and it seems a tad slower. It also may draw a little more battery. But that's the only downside I can see and that never affected my shooting. Regardless of materials (plastic) it feels durable. It's not a weather sealed, all metal lens (hence price). But the mechanics and glass are clearly very good.For $100+/- it's crazy not to get this lens, unless your paying $400 for the 1.4.

"I carried this pack on multiple trips, one recently to DC. I'm a casual, hobbyist photographer.Generally this bag is well made, with many pockets, adjustable compartments, durable (albeit thin) construction and a multitude of exterior straps. I found a day of wearing began to really pull on my neck and shoulders with only a medium load. You must keep it cinched very high and tight to limit the pull. The default setup (main body on top) doesn't help as the weight is high and pulling off your back vs low and against you. This setup makes the most sense though, otherwise you have to dig to the bottom of the bag for your camera or gear. Also, there is no ""quick"" access. This killed me shooting in 15 degree cold of DC. It took too long to change setups/lenses. I had to remove it and unzip each time. Not fun in cold weather.  Also had to set it on the ground. I did like the space though. The exterior pockets held an iPad, my over the ear headphones and small accessories. Excellent flexibility.All in all a good pack if you understand the limitations.  I traded mine for a Tarmac Zuma 7, which fixed my issues noted below.Good:* flexible, multiple straps, spacious* good zippers with weather fold to provide some protection* customizable interior for a full set of gear* well designed and durable.Bad:* feels thin, padding seems average with gear in it* no quick or side access (must remove and unzip)* uncomfortable after a few hours* feels top heavy when loaded* no rain guard included* not great in cold weather (see; no quick access)* top handle feels cheap*[...]","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPE88CU665I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009R6TA#wasThisHelpful","R1NPE88CU665I1","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this vacuum recently as I was feeling my older Dyson pet vac wasn't really doing the job. I was absolutely right. Firstly, the Dyson was not sealed and although it has a ""hepa"" filter, it was losing dust. You could see the dust around the ball and around the base of the body. I vacuumed with the Dyson, brought home the Shark and revacuumed. Incredible! I have a 2 story 1800 sq ft place. The Shark filled up 3 canisters of dirt on the previously vacuumed floors. WOW. I was immediately sold.The Shark has an on/off switch for the roller brush, lights, cleanable filters, long cord, several attachments including a long wand for under appliances or the couch (priceless) and a  small roller that is great for couches, furniture, steps etc. It's so powerful that the roller frequently stops spinning on my longer ""shaggy"" throw rugs. It also emits no dust. Its clean, tight and quiet keeping the dust in the canister system where it belongs.  The small roller works awesome. I used it on upholstery, steps and pet furniture, delighted at how powerful it is and how much dust/dirt it pulled out.I also like how sturdy the Shark is made. The buttons are firm, the latches are strong and intuitively placed. It feels like a vacuum that will last. The roller ball makes access to tight areas easier and it almost feels self propelled gliding along most areas easily (not so on my throw rugs as described above).  My wife has some mild allergies so this vacuum is a god send as we can already see a reduction in dust through using it.Cons:None reallyDoesn't have a height adjustment?

Junk all your old remotes, at least put them in a junk drawer because you will need them when this one breaks. And it will.All 3 of mine worked for a while, maybe even several months, then suddenly when I push a button, it lights up, starts the activity and then restarts. Every time I push a button it does that. New batteries don't help, reprogramming it doesn't help. This remote has some flaw in the power system or power connections that causes it to lose power and restart. Take my advice and don't buy this.I've had the Harmony One for 3+ years.

"I bought this a few years ago and have loved it every since. Firstly, I'm not a germaphobe and am not really anti-household cleaning chemicals. I don't mind using bleach etc and knowing it's really clean. But this is different. I can't even fathom going back to any mop system and pushing dirty water around my floor. Or using a swifter and having to pay for refills just to basically wet wipe my floor.  This steamer is lightweight, easy to maneuver, easy to use and works flawlessly every time. Fill the water, turn it on and steam. I love that it's high temperature kills germs and ""sanitizes"" without having do anything special or add anything to it.Some people complain that ""they still have to scrub their floors"". Really? What's on your floor? Dried chocolate, candle wax, spaghetti sauce? Maybe some people don't understand steam cleaning. You have to go slow and sometimes let it sit over an area moving it back and forth in very small movements to release dirt/grime etc. The steam has to have time to penetrate the stain, heat it and lift it. I suspect many people take a quick pass and then wonder why it didn't remove any and all dirt immediately.  Also understand, it's a steam cleaner, not a pressure washer and not a magic wand. I have had a dog and I have had cats, suffice it to say they dirty up floors. This thing works on probably 90%+ of the floor dirt I need removed. Anything else I wouldn't expect it to get anyway. Don't even get me started on bathrooms. The first few times I used it in there I could smell the stains and dirt it was lifting, that I thought was already pretty clean. Thanks steamer for showing me how much I needed to really clean.. :-(.Lastly, I've used the carpet attachment and it's awesome. It steams cloth surfaces or carpet and does lift odor and/or some stains. Again it's not magic, but I've been really impressed. Steam and heat lifted things that normal cleaning struggled to remove. Great way to remove odor or dirt in carpet fibers.Cons:Cord is too short (I added a black extension cord)Water volume is low (wish it had a bigger reservoir, but I just refill, 90 seconds no problem)After a while the pads don't retain their velcro ability (not a big deal they still stay put)You have to go slow for steaming to work (adjust to it).Overall:I love this steamer. It cleans incredibly well (I compared it side by side against swifters and mops), it's easy to use, kills germs, kills dust mites and keeps my house fresh and clean.[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36W0BTQDB8YUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F2G20O#wasThisHelpful","R36W0BTQDB8YUG","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this mostly for my wife's diamond rings, necklaces and other jewelry. I use hot water, the recommended cleaner and 120 seconds (3 minutes).  The jewelry comes out noticeably cleaner and the diamond regains it's sparkle.  Clearly the water is a dull dirty cloudy color afterwards and you can tell that the sonic vibrations loosened substantial dirt.It's important to follow the directions; stubborn oils or dirt may need to be pre brushed with a toothbrush etc, to loosen it up. Also, I always rinse them in clean water and blow dry them after cleaning. If you handle them wet or store them straight out of the cleaner, the moisture is going to collect new oils and dirt, making you feel like the jewelry is dirty again very quickly.I've used this for a few months now on all sorts of jewelry including bracelets, earrings etc. No complaints.  It did vibrate the coating off an old cheap piece of fashion jewelry, but I shouldn't have put that in there I guess. It did reinforce how powerful it is. No complaints and it's doing what i expected.  I'd say be realistic though, it's not magic and won't remove five years of tarnish on silver or dirt that accumulates over time in prongs etc. Some supplemental cleaning is still necessary, but it's a great way to keep jewelry clean or freshen it up before a night out![...]Thanks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7T8PZCYO4JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MBE6WQ#wasThisHelpful","R1A7T8PZCYO4JT","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a huge fan of Goodkind and this series. But in the last couple books culminating in Chainfire, the series has lost it's way. Im not sure if there are additional writers supporting him or if he's just gotten too busy to devote his full attention to these books, but they are no where near the first 6+ quality.Specifically? 1/3rd of the book feels like rehashing old story lines, reeducating a new reader to the series and awkward historical summaries. Another third of the book are character monologues about vague and/or uninteresting philosophical ideals usually with Richard using some type of childish comparison to try to convince a group of people to see his way. Not to mention, the actions of the characters never truly reflect their growth into their roles, making the dialogues feel inconsistent and artificial. To top it off, after losing a defined antagonist, Goodkind has struggled to identify meaningful tension. The whole ""Chainfire"" premise is vague at best. The solution makes you suspend all belief and is certainly not up to his prior storytelling.I don't enjoy writing this review, but sometimes writers need to quit when they are ahead and stop churning out drivel just to satisfy ambitious publishers.[...]","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226DHFCHYAJ0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CYERO0#wasThisHelpful","R226DHFCHYAJ0M","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought one of these for my wife who discovered that she is allergic to cats after we had our cat for a year. Dang.We put one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Yes, as the machine kicks on the first 24 hours there is an ozone smell from it. This fades quickly and isn't a big deal. I don't even know why people mention it.Usage:It has 5 settings, which is really just fan speed so don't be impressed by the ""germ"" label. We use it on 1-3 mostly. At 5 it's pretty loud, but will quickly recirculate the room air if needed. At 3 it's still fairly fan loud, but tolerable. 1 and 2 are the only ""quiet"" settings. The ambiance lights can be dimmed if needed and it has a filter warning reminding you to clean it.  I LOVE the auto off timer setting. I frequently set it for 2, 4 or 8 hours and leave. A great feature. I also love that the filter is cleanable and I don't have to buy an expensive filter every few months.After approximately 3 days, we noticed a huge difference. Firstly, even time we walk in the bedroom, it has a clean fresh smell. Not that it didn't smell good before, but it's noticeable. Most importantly though, my wife has been sleeping better. She hasn't coughed in the middle of the night (which she did about 4 times a week, loud enough to wake me up). She also doesn't wake up congested and stuffy. This is a huge difference. She's reduced her intake of claritin and is sleeping better. I'm sure it's not a magic fix all for allergies, but it absolutely helped my wife.Overall:I have nothing but positive things to say. It works well, performs as advertised, is nice looking, has solid electronic touch screen buttons, a full feature set and an economical washable/cleanable filter. Most importantly, it seems to be helping.[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6BERH0JPMNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P7SVHS#wasThisHelpful","R3R6BERH0JPMNY","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im a casual photographer, who travels a lot and wanted a SLR to take with me. I also want to enhance my photography as a hobby, although I don't plan on ever being professional. I've owned several compact digital prior to this camera.Size:Even though I knew what I was ordering, I couldn't get over the size. It's so small for an SLR and so lightweight. I've checked multiple times because I didn't think it was loaded in my bag, it felt empty. No kidding, it's that light weight. But still has all the buttons you need, well placed and easy to operate.  It also feels tough and durable, so don't be dissuaded by the light weight or small size. I'm not sure about the concern some voiced about it being ""too small"" to hold. It's very comfortable. If you are going to shoot for 2 hours straight and/or have shot with a larger camera for 5 years, then maybe this would take some getting used to. But it's very easy to manage, comfortable to hold and feels solid in my hand.Performance:I've been experimenting for a couple months now with various settings, different creative shots and I love the camera. Any failures are certainly mine as an amateur. It's easy to shoot, fast enough (I'm not shooting for the NHL) and takes accurate, colorful pictures that are only limited by my creativity. I've shot macro, landscape, architecture, pets and portraits. I love it. It has a deep, feature rich set of custom options, menus and settings. I'm almost addicted to loading my amazing photos into a post photo software (name omitted) and playing with them to see how incredible they can get. That being said, they look incredible (when composed properly) straight from the RAW image. Also remember, this is a canon, so you can use virtually any lens ever created by them.Video:The improved AF Focus and STM lens is evident when shooting video. Video is amazingly clear, the AF does a good job keeping up with most subjects (again not shooting NHL or nocturnal animal scenery). The touchscreen, nearly silent lens combo is a huge improvement over prior versions. All but the most demanding professionals will find it does a remarkable job.Cons:Not many, seriously.No built in stereo mic..(minor issue use an external)No built in wifi (use an eye fi card)I kept this simple as there are some more technical reviews out there. I thought simple usage from a consumer standpoint would be most helpful. My advice, be very careful hanging your hat on some of the Amazon reviews that are overly technical. Some of the reviewers don't know as much as they pretend and quote erroneous facts, like the fact that this camera uses ""contrast phase detect"" for it's auto focus. Wrong, older canon's did, not this one.  If you really need the technical details read a review by dpmag, dppreview, camera labs etc. They will be spot on accurate and not a pseudo  professional opinion.

I tried a stationary owl, didn't work and birds landed on it's head after 2 days.I bought this one, and it worked immediately out of the box. Within 24 hours, not one bird poop on my patio. It was miraculous, seriously.  I hear the head click and spin every so often, it wobbles in the wind and keeps all the birds off my patio.  I don't even have to relocate it, maybe 1 time every few weeks just to be safe. Love it and it's has totally allowed me to reclaim my awesome patio and view!No downsides.

"I bought this bike for my wife to use at the beach as we cruise (almost daily around town).Setup:Not sure of the other reviewers issues. My bike came very well packaged, wrapped and protected. All parts were in perfect condition, not a scratch.  Assembly took me less than an hour and I was moving slowly trying to do it while she was asleep so as to surprise her when she woke up. It was not complicated, fairly simple and I had no issues. It doesn't require ""professional assembly"" as another reviewer stated, unless you aren't at all mechanically inclined.  As for adjustments; the manual tells you how to adjust the brakes and gears. This can't be done until the bike and wheels are assembled, so again I'm not sure why people were commenting about this? It's a very straightforward adjustment. I set mine and in 4 months it's been perfect, no further work needed. Definitely didn't need to pay a professional tune up.Bike Itself;Great bike, comfortable, multiple gears are a must and it works well.  It's well designed and my wife loves it. We added an electra basket to the front and lights. We live in a beach town full of cruisers and this one get's compliments all the time as it's unique.Downsides:NoneYes you have to put it together yourself (if you don't like this then go buy a $500 bike from a box store)The rear gear is exposed versus sealed, so they can slip IF out of adjustment.

"I bought this to keep my cat off certain areas and to help him stop eating my plants. It works very well. Set it up, turn it on, position it and forget it about it. We do and my wife sets it off accidentally.It has a good radius and definitely startles my cat, shooing him out of areas he shouldn't be. The downside is that I think he's learned the unit and steers clear of it, but once it's relocated, the area becomes fair game again. This is the general downside to all deterrence products.  Eventually though, maybe he'll just avoid the area, we'll see.No downsides, it works as advertised, is harmless to the animal, doesn't annoy humans and is more flexible than some of the competitor items.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYGNFZ9IACN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000DZFFN4#wasThisHelpful","RAYGNFZ9IACN9","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this bag to fit my small Canon SL1, extra equipment and an iPad. I returned it as it wasn't a good fit for me.Design:The bag design is well made. Reinforced zippers, heavy duty ballistic nylon, some weather proofing and a lot of customizable padding. The clips work as advertised, locking in to prevent any accidental opening of the bag, but left unclipped with an ""easy pull"" tab you can quickly access the camera.  The upper compartment has room for accessories and could fit a small bottled water, snacks etc or camera gear.  The iPad pocket was disappointing. It's very snug and couldn't fit my iPad with a case on it. It was also very difficult to get in and out due to the tight fit. Technically it fits, but this didn't work for me.Comfort:The bag is bulky due to it's square/cylindrical shape. It felt bigger on my back than it looks. The straps were very stiff and didn't feel comfortable to me at all. Maybe over time they would have loosened up or softened, but I didn't want to wait and find out. Although I looked the idea of the 3 in 1, in practical use I found the set up cluttered and honestly annoying. Any straps you don't use, have to be tucked against your back (which is also where the iPad sleeve is). Although the back's well padded, it adds to the bulkiness of the feel. If you really need 3 in 1 options, maybe this is ok for you, but I didn't want to deal with the bulkiness all the time I'm NOT using the backpack or extra straps.Overall:A very well made and well designed bag. It's protective, versatile and would last. I'm not a fan of the straps, the bulkiness or the iPad sleeve space.  It falls into the old adage, Jack of all trades, master of none. A good flexible bag if you can deal with the idiosyncrasies.Downsides:ipad sleeve is too small, requires you remove the case and isn't functional (for me).The bag is bulky for it's measurements (boxy)The straps were not comfortableThe multiple straps are cluttering when not in use (even tucked away, see bulky above).Too expensive for the bag itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D0UOB3R9GFT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UHKR5Y#wasThisHelpful","R3D0UOB3R9GFT1","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my Canon SL1 with the stock lens, a hood, a few extra cards, extra battery and filters.Design:The bag is well made. The zippers are strong, all the seams seem completely reinforced and it's very well thought out.  It has solid padding inside all major pockets and across the sling. The main compartment has a neoprene ""patent pending"" hammock. My camera lens with the hood attached pushes nicely into the star shaped opening and it holds the camera in place. It is velcro so it can be adjusted or removed if needed. I'm not a huge fan of the hammock as it requires a little force in and out, but it seems to work so I'll try it for a while before removing it. The interior space is ample and would support a much larger camera body than mine.  There is plant of depth for my 18-55 lens, Im sure a larger lens would fit, but probably not a huge zoom. It has a large side pocket that I was able to fill with a small bottle of water, multiple protein bars and a small bag of nuts. There's an external set of straps that are designed for a tripod, I've also used it to latch in my jacket or sweatshirt, perfect.  I really like that the slings unclip in both places allowing you to easily adjust or put on the pack.Comfort:The pack is very comfortable for a sling. Meaning, slings always put additional weight on one shoulder. This one has ample padding, spacious adjustment (for tall or shorter people, I'm 6'0"") and a secondary strap to secure it so it doesn't swing. I rarely need this and keep it tucked away with the cord keeper.  The padding makes it fairly comfortable. I've worn it for several hours at Disneyland, hiking etc, loaded with camera and food. After a full day I start to feel it, but it takes a few hours. Loaded lightly with just the camera and no water, I don't even feel it. It's incredibly easy to swing under your arm and position to take your camera out. It unzips and the camera is right there. Contrary to bag commercials, I'm not in a position where I need to suddenly draw the camera like a western gunslinger, but it is surprisingly quick and easy to get to.Downsides:After a few hours fully loaded you may feel it a little, it's a sling, not a backpack.If you need to load 5 lenses, a full frame body and a bunch of extras, it may be too small.When carrying it by the handle, the slings and straps seem all over the place, like octopus arms. With a little creative cord keeping you can reduce this, but it is worth noting.Overall:If you are looking for a small, easy to wear convenient sling, this is a great choice. Well made, well designed and comfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N71P2R1YDGZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ISXBFI#wasThisHelpful","R1N71P2R1YDGZ9","A28LXU0LM7GYIC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LXU0LM7GYIC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Canon hood fits perfectly on my SL1 screwing perfectly to my lens and offering protection as well as limiting light/flare.  It is sturdy and well made. It feels like it's a little heavier duty/thicker than some of the knock off non Canon brands.

There are a few fantasy-trope plot aspects that may be a bit obvious to readers who are very familiar to the genre, however, for the most part I found the book to be exciting and surprising.  A very nice read, well worth checking out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWUXNZSJUQ54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545522285#wasThisHelpful","R2KWUXNZSJUQ54","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not quite as pigmented as I expected,  however it is very glossy/shimmery. Unfortunately, caused my lips to dry out very badly.  I mixed it with a base layer of tiny touch of Burts Beeswax for moisture and darker red lipstick to get a nice glossy hue.  Not bad overall, just not quite was I was expecting initially.

"Turtle Beach makes excellent budget gaming headsets and the Recon 60P is no exception.  I have always been impressed with their products in the past, and this set seems thoughtfully designed and well-constructed.PROS:-USB and 3.5mm connectors allow for versatile usage: you can connect it to your PS3/4 via USB, your PC or mobile devices via 3.5mm, etc…-Great quality audio, similar in quality to the mid-range $99-149 headsets.-Good mic with minimal background noise, distortion on Skype, Mumble, Ventrilo, XBOX Live…-Mic audio monitored in headset (you can hear yourself, if you choose, to avoid shouting)-Over-ear design is comfortable and blocks ambient noise.  Ear cups are soft.-Extra long cord (13’) reaches completely across the room-Volume control/mute functions on cordPossible CONS:-The extra-long cord is a bit of a trade off.  If you are using this at your desk, you’ll have a tangle of cords at your feet.-Microphone does not retract, however it can be removed completely.-I’m a little more partial to the P12 design, in my opinion is lighter weight and more comfortable.This headset really feels like it was designed by actual gamers who knew exactly what they wanted in a headset.  It’s a great budget headset and probably one of the best under $99 wired headsets.  Definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUJ8TC3QTMRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UI6#wasThisHelpful","RSUJ8TC3QTMRW","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was born in the gap between the theatrical release of Back to the Future I and II.  My parents (bless them!) wasted no time exposing me to this astounding and timeless series at the age of 7.  I was, thenceforth, a science fiction super fan and rank BTTF among my all-time favorite pieces of pop culture across all formats.  Upon the 30th anniversary of its release I started scouring the internet for signs of historical ephemera.  I was delighted and promptly ordered this tome, eagerly awaiting its timely October 21th arrival.The book itself is designed and bound quite nicely, I am quite picky about these things.  My copy arrived shrink wrapped and in generally good condition (there's a slight tear in the cover material on the back cover due to poor packing material).The interior pages are glossy, printed on nice stock paper and all 224 pages are stocked full of wonderful photos, prints of scripts, storyboards, concept art and handwritten production notes.  There are also several prop replicas (see my photos) which have been included, peppered along throughout the book.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the prop replicas are a very, very cool addition to the book in itself; however, the method in which they are affixed to the pages was very irritating.  In some cases, a thick peel-able backing glue was used which left a round ""oil stain"" on either the book page, the prop or both.  In other cases, a more treacherous and near-impossible to remove tape was used which caused some tearing/blemishing of the book page, the prop or both.  I ended removing all of the props and storing them in an 8 x 10 envelope for safekeeping.Here is a list of all the included prop replicas:- Save the Clock Tower Flyer (with Jennifer's number on the back)- Doc's hand drawn Flux Capacitor schematic- Marty's pink tardy slip (reason for being late: slacker)- Marty and sibling color photo (holographic: holding it at an angle makes Marty's brother and sister disappear!)- ""Do Not Open Until 1985"" (The letter that could have potentially disrupted the space-time continuum)- Lorraine and George's Enchantment Under the Sea Dance photo- Jaws 19 Movie Poster (Directed by Max Spielberg)- Receipt from 2015 for the purchase of the antique Sports Amanac- Western Union letter from Doc c. 1885- A ""Biff"" dollar bill from the alternate 1985- ""A Match Made in Space"" by George McFly dust jacket cover- Portrait of Doc and Marty in front of the future clock tower clock c. 1885The content/writing of the book is just marvelous and will be an absolute thrill for even casual fans (if they even exist).  I have been enjoying reading it all day and have been driving my friends and family bonkers popping up with new trivia about the series every 5 minutes. All three movies are covered, and attention is given to the Universal Studios ride (with its accompanying mini-movie) and the animated television series.All-in-all this is a real treat and I'm delighted to add it to my BTTF collection.  My tremendous appreciation and gratitude for everyone involved in bringing this project to the fans.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8KQP6154LXXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062419145#wasThisHelpful","R8KQP6154LXXS","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book itself and illustrations are absolutely, incredibly extraordinary.  In that way, this is 100% a 10-STAR book and is absolutely to die for for Harry Potter fans. I was ravenous to get my hands on my copy as soon as it was delivered this morning, but was quickly disappointed.First, Amazon's packaging was utterly and despicably inadequate. (See Photo)  My book was shipped in a box, with *no packing material* of any kind.  At first glance, it seemed OK.  But when I took a close look at my dust jacket, I was extremely upset to find that the gold foil lettering for ""Harry Potter"" had been rubbed away and destroyed completely in some places leaving ugly, black matte in its place-- pock marking the otherwise handsome gold lettering.  Also, the matte-finish of the dust jacket had been rubbed so badly due to the bad packaging that it left scars and shiny markings where the matte finish was worn off.  For an obvious gift/collectors item, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I called Amazon and they didn't seem to ""get"" what my fuss was all about and just offered to ship a replacement which, undoubtedly, will be shipped in exactly the same way.Second, after I got over my initial outrage over the shipping/packaging.  I sat down to enjoy the actual book itself, which as I said is absolutely extraordinary! I was extremely cautious handling the book and binding, being unsure how tolerant the binding is of weight.  I carefully opened both the right and left sides of the binding and supported the weight of the opened cover using a small pillow.  By the time I reached the back 3/4th of the book (on Professor McGonagall's full page illustration) the binding separated from the spine the very first time I turned the page.  In other words, the binding fell apart during my very first pass through the book.  (See Photo).  Another thing that really drove me crazy was the way that the stitched in book mark was carelessly folded into the book.  It left dents all over my pages (See Photo), which of course had to be on a full page illustration of Hagrid!Needless to say I'm in awe how Bloomsbury has managed to put together such an incredible project, with JK Rowling's remarkable literature and Jim Kay's otherworldly illustrations-- and allowed it to be put together in a low quality binding!  I noticed that all of the previous Harry Potter books were printed and bound in USA (some in Mexico) but this book was printed and bound in China.  I would like to hope that they would quality check a thing like this, but perhaps not.  Either way, I am extremely disappointed in the quality/binding of my book.  I would be interested to know if others are seeing the same thing. And please, Amazon, pack these books in bubble wrap and packing material! Not all alone in a box...Update (October 9th): I have finally received my new book and it was in much, much better condition.  The cover and spine were tight, intact and falling apart from the binding like my original copy.  Addtl photos to follow...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XCRHJ6Q51KMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545790352#wasThisHelpful","R2XCRHJ6Q51KMP","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charmin Basic has become our preferred toilet paper, not just because of its great quality-- but because it lasts significantly longer than the other ""ultra plush"" papers (which are really just excessively fluffy and clog your toilets) and can be used as tissue for allergies due to its non scented, non-bleached fibers.  I think this is the perfect compromise between 1-ply/industrial style super thin paper and the ultra plush tissue which is far too thick.  Very good quality and an attractive price.

"I was drawn to this book because: 1) I love a good historical fiction novel, and 2) I found the premise unusual against a backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.  In fact, I regrettably know almost nothing of the Spanish Civil War, other than the fact that it was a great human tragedy. Our heroine here, Drina, is caught between worlds being half-Spaniard and half-gypsy.  When her life unravels, she must take on a journey of self discovery, uncover truths and forge her own path.The prose is absolutely beautiful and among one of the most well written books I have read this year.  In general, the plot is well crafted and moves along at a satisfactory pace.  Action-craving readers or steamy-romance seekers may complain of pacing or lack of substance.  Also, the ending was a bit disappointing, which would make this actually about a 3.5 star read for me.  Overall, if you have an interest in historical fiction and a heroine's coming of age journey in an uncertain world, you will most likely enjoy this book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTP1HQWENXL9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477817336#wasThisHelpful","RTP1HQWENXL9I","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! Christina Farley has outdone herself! I really enjoyed GILDED and the second installment SILVERN didn't disappoint at all-- in fact, it may even be a few degrees better! This book has tons of plotting, intrigue, action and intensity.  Jae is a unique and truly likeable heroine.  She's intelligent and capable and doesn't collapse into a blabbering heap the moment a boy comes around (sorry, Bella Swan.)  I have noticed lots of people complaining that the cultural references/elements of the book are not ""real Korean.""  Its fantasy folks.  One of my absolute favorite series I read this year, the Grisha Trilogy, wasn't really Russian but brought elements of that Russian culture to create a newly imagined fantasy world.  I don't think the author of GILDED ever claimed that she was going after a culturally accurate Korea.  Even so, this is a great series-- even more a plus that its on Kindle Unlimited now.

"I devoured this book the moment it came in the mail. The premise looked absolutely awesome and within the first 20 pages I was gripped-- hook, line and sinker. In a nutshell: WOLF BY WOLF takes place in an alternate 1956, in a world where the Third Reich reigned victorious in WW2. Now Hitler's empire, along with the Empire of Japan control the overwhelming majority of Europe, Asia and Africa and its peoples. The protagonist, Yael, survived the Holocaust and is a member of the resistance plotting to assassinate Hitler himself.This book was truly incredible and remarkably well written. Most definitely one of my favorite reads this year, by far. There are so many unique elements, I worry that a comparison to ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" or ""Code Name Verity"" devalues its truly particular qualities. But, suffice it to say there are elements of dystopia, historical fiction, science fiction/fringe science, mystery, thrill, romance and loads of intrigue.My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that this book keeps you going at a break neck pace with such a strong, forward driving plot that it demands a solid and satisfying conclusion. I had not realized when I began reading that this is a planned series. While I don't mind it being part of a series, I truly wish there had been a more satisfying conclusion as a payoff for all the suspense. Instead, we have an abrupt ending. The more I chew on it, the more I wonder how this will work in a series. In truth, I think this could have been a truly incredible standalone with some adjustments to the ending, but we shall see.All in all, excellent writing, excellent world building/imagination, compelling characters and a fantastic plot. A truly enjoyable read, despite a slightly disappointing conclusion. I will certainly read the next installment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2594VJWOWAW5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316405124#wasThisHelpful","R2594VJWOWAW5I","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is NOT TFIOS, I am a little disappointed that so many readers are just seeing the words ""teen boy and girl + cancer"" and automatically assuming its a rip-off of John Green's book. It's not.  This is a completely different story, and in my mind, that's a good thing.  I thought that TFIOS was more than 75% fairy tale. It was sad, yes, but it didn't really dig into the reality of cancer in my opinion.  A.J Betts hits much closer to reality with his portrayal of teenage cancer and how to reconcile your imminent mortality with the need to keep living each day. This is not a love story, but it is a beautiful story of friendship.  Definitely recommended, especially for readers looking for something a little deeper than TFIOS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXNH3MHC3FZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544331648#wasThisHelpful","RNXNH3MHC3FZR","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How did this get published? It drove me crazy to pedal through this book...First things first: this book is NOT about assassins. This book is about a bratty teenage girl who is about as dimensional as a blank sheet of paper. She goes on, and on, and on and on talking about how beautiful she is, how shes the ""worlds best"" assassin and how ""bored"" she is with everything. Then, when presented with opportunities to show us anything (compete in a gladiator-style duel, attend a ball, seek a deadly sorcery, solve a mystery) she literally just wants to go take a nap. (Literally).The dialogue is probably the very worst part, and what killed the book for me. The way the narrator whines and carries on is infantile and reminiscent of inane middle-school lunch room conversations. I mean, what world-class assassin falls apart and takes to bed in the middle of the day when she gets her *gasp* monthly cycle. Nevermind that, why is that even a scene? Also, she self-proclaims herself as a ""prodigy"" assassin, but shes never even engaged in a single fight--truly--not one action/battle sequence. The author needs to read some R.A Salvatore (specifically Artemis Entreri) and play some Assassins Creed before she writes her next ""Assassin"" novel.If you're attracted to a good love story, be advised: The romance is flat and boring. The love interest(s) are not interesting or likeable. They seem to be guys that are just ""around."" There wasn't a particularly compelling character in the entire book. I'm sad to say that even 8 hours into reading, I really don't care whether she triumphs or fails in her quest. And, I don't really care what the mystery evil is that's lurking behind the corner either. The author really didn't get me to *care* about her world, characters or plot.It's too bad... the plot is a GREAT idea, but the execution is hideous.  One more pet peeve: why does she vomit so much? Someone get this girl some pepto bismol! I have read 50+ books, most of them fantasy, and I think maybe 1-2 instances of vomiting.  This girl vomits multiple times per chapter.

"I really like these Burts Bee's lip balms.  I was most eager for the vanilla ""flavor"" but was slightly surprised at the texture.  I typically use cherry chap-stick (Hey, it gets the job done!) which has a much more ""solid"" feel.  The vanilla, pomegranate and pink grapefruit flavors all have the same somewhat greasy texture.  Upon checking the ingredient list, I see why: beeswax is the third ingredient, behind sunflower and coconut oils.  The yellow capped ""Beeswax lip balm"" has the best texture-- solid, minty and long lasting.  I wish the other flavors had the same texture, but they're all still very good and will make great little gifts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVXGCDLVMO60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1XLQOK#wasThisHelpful","R2PVXGCDLVMO60","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Armada has been sitting at the top of my pre-order list for months.  As soon as it hit my kindle, I started reading it and listened to the Audible version as well over the course of the day.  First and foremost: this is not ""Ready Player One"". As much as you may be tempted to compare this to RP1, you probably shouldn't lest you'll be let down.  But, this is a very fun, nostalgic, fast paced, romp through interstellar space with hardcore gamer geeks saving the world. The entire plot takes place over the course of one (maybe two) full days, so its heavy on action and light on character depth and development.  There are pop culture references a plenty, which are laid like bread crumbs for eager fans.  All in all, the plot was well imagined, hastily executed but ultimately enjoyable. I've definitely read worse (and better) but you really can't go wrong here if you are a video game, science fiction, pop culture or fantasy fan.The Audible narration, performed by Will Wheaton, was excellent (as expected) including epic Yoda voices throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P73TFOCRIZUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137250#wasThisHelpful","R3P73TFOCRIZUP","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Admittedly, I passed it up to read more established authors books several times over the last few months... I wish I hadn't!  This book is OUTSTANDING! Sabaa Tahir hits all the benchmarks to set her apart from the average and mediocre fantasy novelists out there.  Unique and intriguing magic system & world building, check! Deep, interesting and resourceful characters, check! Great heroes and villains, check! Intrigue, politics, treachery and suspense, check!! Complicated and exciting romance, check!!

"I really enjoyed the first 2/3rds of this novel but the massive plot twist really ruined everything.  The problem is that there is literally no ""up side"" to anything in the entire novel.  Two flawed and vulnerable teens, struggle, struggle and then struggle some more.  The author builds some suspense with the budding romance between two main characters, but dashes it over and over again until the reader regrets meeting these two people at all.  For me, a ""poignant"" novel is one where the characters live on in your memory-- where they meet challenges, struggle and ultimately triumph in some way that makes their tale moving and memorable.  The portrayal of OCD is not wrong per say, but as other reviewers have mentioned, its not very realistic.  If you are looking for something heartwarming, look elsewhere.  This novel is filled with emotional downers... I think I felt happier after reading Fault in Our Stars!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQO3ZM8ZJR2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062271105#wasThisHelpful","R2QQO3ZM8ZJR2U","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Since You’ve Been Gone” is a well written, summer teen drama peppered with romance, comedy and enduring friendships.  The protagonist Emily is extremely awkward and shy, which makes her both endearing and annoying throughout the book.  At times, her inability to stand on her own two feet and survey the world around her builds suspense—other times, it’s bordering on unrealistic.For me, the book is a solid 3.5 stars and recommended more enthusiastically for younger teens (age 13-15).  The character development was not quite where it should have been, given the length of the book.  By the last page, I felt acquainted with everyone but I didn’t really know any one character up close and personally.  The central conflict (“Will she complete the list?”) was never really in question, it was assumed that she would—one way or another—trudge her way through the list by the end. This lack of suspense kept the book from gaining much momentum, in fact, I stopped caring about whether she completed the list at all 1/3rd of the way in. All I was worried about was whether she would finally get together with her senior-class-president-neighbor Frank. But, my interest remained piqued from start to finish.In many ways, Emily probably reflects a much more accurate 16 year old teen girl than Hollywood or other bestseller-list romance novel teens.  She’s scared, uncertain, and eager all at once.  She doesn’t senselessly dive into sex, drugs, alcohol or dangerous situations.  She needs her Mom and Dad, her brother and her best friend for guidance and support.  These less overt qualities make her more real, but admittedly fail to “pop off the page.”  At the end of the day, this is a novel about finding out who you are, and finding your own identity.  It’s about going from being “the girl who hands out with so-and-so” to becoming “You.”Ending Spoiler:I think that Emily should have written Sloane a letter (with a new list enclosed) rather than take the road trip to SC.  Ultimately, the road trip didn’t move the plot forward in any appreciable/unique way for her and Frank and seemed to be a downshift in pace at the end.  I would have preferred Emily spend the time making the grand gesture to her present (Frank) as opposed to her past (Sloane), but that’s just me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJE3ERQ5VRXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442435011#wasThisHelpful","RKJE3ERQ5VRXZ","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beautiful Tone, great feel and durable.  I love Elixir strings.  We use them on our basses, acoustic and electric guitars.  These are outstanding bass strings that are easy to install, feel great, eliminate fret noise and finger squeaks.  They stretch (as expected) after you initially string them, however, once they settle I rarely needed to re-tune.

"Extremely thought provoking and profound.  Highly recommended for teens/pre-teens.  The book deals with serious (but real) subject matter, so parents may need to use discretion.  There is also significant profanity.  However, I still recommend this for almost any teen because bullying seems to have become a larger than life issue given our overly-connected society.  The characters are flawed (real) and not often likeable, but this adds to the impact and message behind the story.  I think the author has done a great job bringing the narrator's voice out in a realistic, believable way that will resonate with young readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMML3VK496F3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062305301#wasThisHelpful","RMML3VK496F3G","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took the GRE myself and have spent the last few years coaching other students preparing for the GRE.  Unquestionably, the best way to prepare is to practice questions that are actually phrased, arranged and ""GRE-styled.""  The other test prep books use mutiple choice and free response questions that aren't realistically ""styled"" as they would appear on the GRE.  They also seem to be much less difficult than the real questions you'll encounter on the exam.  This book from Manhattan Prep is appropriately difficult and filled with hundreds upon hundreds of useful, realistic GRE questions.  Once you've passed your test, the book itself makes an ample doorstop-- its truly a whopping 5lbs.  Make sure when you practice, you divide your practice questions into sets and time yourself.

"This is a great all around headset that I keep handy at my desk.  I have an office setup which includes: a PC, an iMac, iPad and iPhone.  I only occasionally have need of headphones and/or a mic, so having one single headset to work for all of my devices is a real plus. This is a lightweight headset with moderately good audio quality and very good mic quality for video conferencing, voice-only calls and online game chat.  The audio quality is certainly not going to blow anyone away (look at the price point of this headset and set your expectations accordingly) but at the same time its great for what its designed for.The headset itself is fairly comfortable, though I would not wear it for hours at a time (i.e. for long gaming sessions, pick up a better/padded headset).  I especially like that you can wear the mic on either side, rotate it upright or remove it entirely.

"I like this case, but with some caveats:1) The size: it is much larger than I expected.  For ladies, if you are looking for something low profile and sleek to clip onto your running shorts, this probably isn't what you are looking for.  The pouch will be obvious under an athletic top/tee shirt.2) The pouch is secured to your clothing via magnets.  You will need to take this into consideration before you just stick your wallet, keys, iPod, etc... into it.  You could quite easily demagnetize your credit cards, or key cards, key fabs, hard drives in older iPods etc... I'm weary of sticking my electronics or keychain (with electronic devices on it) into this for that reason.  On the other hand, if you needed to carry around an inhaler, some medication, a traditional set of keys, etc... this would work perfectly.I'm much more likely to secure this to my bike than to my waist band for an outdoor excursion.

"Readers will be divided on this one into: ""love it"" or ""hate it"" camps.  Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly blown away by this one.  Teen angst has been done (a lot) and heavy topics, life events and struggles have been tackled really well by the genre.  This book doesn't stand up in a field with so many other options.  (See Eleanor and Park, Paper Towns, Finding Alaska, Perks of Being a Wallflower, the DUFF, Speak, etc... etc... just to name a few) In particular, there are cliches that are perpetuated seemingly for the sake of it.  Lots of harsh language that lends no apparent authenticity to the dialogue and shallow, one-dimensional characters that many readers will find difficult to relate to.

"I tried two different sizes of these before ultimately returning them all and looking for an alternative shoe/brand. I typically wear size 7 Saucony running shoes and have been very happy with them. I've bought dozens of pairs over the years without issue, but sometimes I want to try something new and (gasp) try new colors.  These Mizunos stood out to me because of their minimalist-trail style (I do a lot of off pavement running) and the funky color scheme.  The shoes themselves are extremely high quality and well constructed.  But, they wear very awkwardly on my feet.  The laces and tongue strap and contrict the top of my foot very tightly.  Even after loosening the laces to the point where they were too short to tie, the top of my foot was pushing up against the top of the shoe very uncomfortably.  Furthermore, the soles are extremely flat and provide zero arch support. I suppose if you have a very slight/thin bone structure these shoes would work nicely.

"I have a mouse drawer in my desk like most people have a cable drawer.  Gamers know what I'm talking about-- the ""one mouse to rule them all' is elusive if not impossible to create or find. Logitech comes pretty darn close.  I play almost all games, but the following more often than others:- Starcraft 2- World of Warcraft- 3rd Person RPG (Pillars of Eternity, Baldurs Gate, etc...)- FPS (Call of Duty, Battlefield)I also do a significant amount of productivity app work during my day job (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Audacity, general interneting...) and prefer not to change out my gaming mouse if need be.Since last year, I have been using the Logitech Proteus Core with custom weights as my de facto standard mouse.  It's a beautifully engineered mouse and has fit the bill for all of my ranging uses thus far.  I have a fingertip/claw grip and very small hands.  The Proteus is built for people like me.When I first encountered the Daedalus, I was intrigued.  It's a completely different mouse to be sure-- its lightweight, minimalist in terms of exterior features and was unlikely to displace the Proteus on my desk.  However, I must say it is an astoundingly comfortable and precise mouse with (finally) the perfect lightweight mouse ""feel"".  Logitech got the materials/construction JUST RIGHT.  It's low profile on my desk and has a delightful, tactile left and right click.  The programmable thumb buttons are in the perfect, natural position where my thumb knuckle lines up with the side of the mouse. As I said, the mouse is lightweight but doesn't feel hollow or insubstantial in my hand or as it glides across the tracking surface.  All along, that has been my pet peeve with lightweight mice which has led me to always gravitate towards the custom weighted mice.As a further test of character, I Photoshopped for several days with the Daedalus on my iMac which has been an equally delightful experience.

I was prowling around B&N one lonely night and happened across “The Truth Commission.” The clever cover art led me to pick up the book and fan through the pages like a flipbook and I was surprised to find doodles and footnotes (of all things!) charmingly peppered throughout the text.  I knew right away this would be a fun read.It turns out, the whimsical typeset delivered on its promise—‘Truth’ is not just a fun read, it’s a fantastic read! I absolutely loved the protagonist Normandy, whose depth is revealed in little, bite size pieces over the length of the novel.  The ironic real-life-but-totally-fantasy world is at once a hysterical Wonderland and a plausible setting.  I think that fans of Rainbow Rowells’ “Fangirl” will enjoy the layering of the story within a story within a story.Juby breaks all YA conventions here and does a great job doing it. The real, print version of the book is an extra treat with the aforementioned footnotes and doodles taking the form of handwriting/comic sketches.  The eBook version (Kindle and iBook), while more convenient, suffer a bit in translation (all of the footnotes have to be tapped deliberately, where they are housed on a separate page from the text).  However, the doodles remain intact within the text.  The audio book I have not yet listened to, but I encourage readers to at least take a gander at the real book ;-)I’m surprised that I’m the second review here, so all the more reason to shout “5 STARS!” if you’re looking for a really good book with a quirky setting and an irresistible hook, you've found it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FB7AQ1WMCRLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451468775#wasThisHelpful","R2FB7AQ1WMCRLW","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As other reviewers have mentioned, Purina seems to have placed their ""Pro Plan"" label on anything that it would stick to.  I was very disappointed to read the ingredients list in this particular dry food:Trout, brewer's rice, chicken meal, pea protein, soy protein isolate, dried egg product, animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), soy protein concentrate, sodium caseinate....First and foremost, ""Brewer's Rice"" is a byproduct of rice processing.  This stuff is nutritionally lacking in any substantial quality.  It's the stuff that got rejected from its first and second pass down the assembly line (not good enough for packaged rice OR for making rice flour!).  The next few ingredients, particularly: pea protein, soy protein, animal fat, soy protein (again), and sodium caseinate leave me concerned.  I don't eat ANY of these processed foods, so why should my cat?In my opinion, Purina has ""fudged the numbers"" to get their protein count up to 45%.... Rice and Soy make up the substantial portion of this percentage, neither of which is an ideal source of nutrients for a feline.  Additionally, the fiber percentage (2%) seems extremely low compared to other high quality foods.For a 5-9lb cat, Purina suggests a feeding amount of 41-66 grams of dry food per serving. For a 66 gram serving this would be:118 calories from proteins80 calories from fats80 calories from carbohydrates~ 278 calories per servingTo me, this seems like a lot.  You would really need to take care to control your cat's portions (particularly for more sedentary, indoor cats)All in all, there are better foods out there.  If it's on sale and/or your cat is underweight, perhaps its not a bad choice overall. But for folks who are looking for a superior, healthy choice for their feline, I'd skip this one.Purina is usually so reliable too...","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIR3HUEWW1MQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVMMK7Q#wasThisHelpful","RIR3HUEWW1MQQ","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these yoga towels for my travel workouts.  They are plush, large and can be used for stretching in your hotel, hotel gym, or for laying out at the pool or spa.  I use the smaller towel for staying dry during my workout and the larger towel as a ""mat"".  Unlike most microfiber towels, these are not scratchy but rather more plush like a downy terry cloth.

""Nightbird"" is geared towards middle school readers (age 8 - 12) and would likely not get the same vote of enthusiasm from young adults looking for sophisticated paranormal romance and that sort of thing.

"I just received my Speck case today and was instantly impressed.  I appreciate when a company clearly puts effort into designing something as seemingly mundane as an iPhone case.  Let's face it, more than any other companion in life, our iPhone (and its case) has to deal with all our drama.  It's a big demand to put on a little mold of plastic.I have every confidence in my Speck case however.  It's got quite a resume: 2x military-grade protection, three layers of crash protection squeezed into an impressive 0.18"" rubber liner.  The Otter-box-esque rubber bumper keeps your corners and screen safe from those impressively well timed vertical drops onto the pavement that would otherwise shatter your world. And, in the event you find some feat of strength the case itself (not your phone, mind you) can't handle, Speck has doled out a generous lifetime warranty on the case.The colors are pretty darn cool. Teal and orange, I can rock it! It's slim, lightweight, adds no bulk to your modern art (aka-- the iPhone 6) and doesn't obstruct any ports (headphones, lighting adapter, speakers, mic and cameras are all given ample room to do their thing).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDIB39SCBQQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON39CQ8#wasThisHelpful","RFDIB39SCBQQ3","A3KZEGBTPH6MMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KZEGBTPH6MMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was certainly not what I thought it would be. I did not even finish the book. It was on my Kindle and I read about 65% of it and had enough. When reading the preview of the book I thought Gabriel was going to be a hired killer, after leaving the CIA, that took care of people who where doing good people bad. But Gabriel just is ready to kill everybody and anybody.  For example, three FBI agents that are protecting a person he has a hit on. He shoots them from a half mile away. I would say a great part of what he does is not even possible. He was not a person that protected good people, he just killed who ever got in his way, good or bad. Way to much for me.

Hunt was in the first story in the book after that he was in the background assigning the others where to go. They may have picked up a new Deputy Marshall, will find out in the next book.

Many have written several lines telling what the book is about so I won't go there. It is a good mystery. Good police work from a man, Faraday, who is no longer a policeman. There are many twist and turns and surprises. I gave it a three star because I really had trouble keeping up with all the people involved. There were so many. My small brain could not remember who was who or why they where mentioned again. Lordy I don't think I ever saw that many people in a book before.

When it did get into the action part it really turned loose. Frank Shaw was a good character, true to life, made mistakes, but kept prodding along until he accomplished his goal. I thought Sam Cartwright and his Morman buddies were great. Sam was unreal that he would go to that much trouble for someone he barely knew. The lack of bad language was good.

In this one Charles visits three different railroad camps and the same story is told at each camp. I almost have it memorized by now. Also the story or how he came to America and was found is told two or three times again. Same story as in previous books. If you can stand the repeats of all the same things in each book and just skim through them some of the rest of the read makes a pretty fair story.  If people were treated like Charles treats people our world would be a better place today. He finally is on a ship to England. I am guessing the same stories will appear in the next book also.

I usually quit if I start reading something like this but  I kept thinking this could not be in a Sean Drummond book. But it was. The read is depressing and I felt worse when i finished that when I started. I would hope Mr. Haig goes back to the old Sean Drummond and does not let him end on this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YE2J2YOM2PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVOJY4U#wasThisHelpful","R31YE2J2YOM2PI","A1N01YOBWF8WDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N01YOBWF8WDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alex us certainly a different character. He works for ATF but still lives in a garage next to his Mother and Father. Still eats there every chance he gets. Still talks about his cases with his Father. I liked the beginning of the book, did not like the middle  and then liked the ending. So I put a star in the middle. Alex is good with his fist and feet as you will read and see. If he gets something on his mind he stays with it until the end. He is no ladies man. Does not even know what to say to them but they seem to throw themselves at him. There is lots of murders in this one. Using several different methods. Alex does stay with it and has a pretty good ending. If not getting it on Kindle Unlimited I would not get it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ONKD31TJG8TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJ0F1JI#wasThisHelpful","R2ONKD31TJG8TZ","A1N01YOBWF8WDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N01YOBWF8WDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Storm Warrior books are becoming a lot of repeat of previous books and even the same thing is said in this one more than once. If I did not get them through Kindle Unlimited I would not buy them. You have to learn to skim over pages several times as what you are reading has already been somewhere else. Part of the books are good and does show the very human side of Storm Warrior or Charles as he has become known. He should soon be leaving the West, I don't know how it will still be called a Western read at that time.

I kept thinking it would soon be over and it would take off in a new direction. I did not like part of the ending. I liked what happened to Santoro but I don't think it was right with Val. There are some things that you can justify and some you can not. I won't go into detail as it seems others are ok with this and that is fine.

Each group or person sent will fulfill his duties, head back to Denver and we will pick up some body else who will do the same thing. I thought the ending of this dragged so long, I thought it would never end. I like the series better when I was about Hunt.

"I have read every Prey novel that Sanford has written. I have really like the character of Lucus Davenport and all the people that he works with. They usually make an excellent read. The best thing I can think of about this one is it does bring out Letty for a larger part. I wonder if it is leading to a series of her own. The rest of his crew is just barely mentioned and Marie not at all. There is way to much violence in this one for me. The Davenport series usually does not have that much. A lot of it reminds me of a western novel, there are shoot outs, beatings and murders for no reason. Much like a western would be.I don't know if this is the end of Lucus or not but if not I hope it goes back to he one that has been it all the previous books. I never heard of Travelers or Juggalos until now. I hope I don't again.If you are expecting a normal Lucus Davenport book this one is not for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMZSD4JYZR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168796#wasThisHelpful","R2EMZSD4JYZR6","A1N01YOBWF8WDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N01YOBWF8WDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Was a very good read. Could it have happened. I really doubt it. But that is why they call it fiction. The book tells of many battles and victories of Storm Warrior and the tribe of Sioux that adopted him. They fight the Pawnee and the Blackfeet and of course always win. Storm Warrior is very well educated and wants to teach the Sioux the way of the white man as the time will come that they will take over their land. Don't really think this is the way it went down but so be it.It is an easy read, does not require much thought and will hold your attention.

"I have read the other John Puller books and really liked them. I was disappointed it this one.  I still really like the character of John and hope that if another is written it gets back to being like the first two. The starting and the ending of this one was great but the middle just seemed to drag to much, to many pages that really did not say anything. I also got really lost and confused with all the intitals that stood for different organizations. These were used quite a bit and I never did really get what they were, such as, STRATCOM, INSCOM, ISR, NSC, DTRA, and START. They kept being thrown in and I had no ideal what they were. They were explained the firt time there were used but after that they were just there. My old head could not retain what they stood for.

"I agree with a lot of reviewers. the best part of the book is the dog. Of course I am an animal lover so that might make a difference. Gideon does show that he is human, he has many faults and does tell lies to make things work in his favor. There is a lot of that going around. The enlisting of a civilian to help him was way out in left field. Seems like the writer spent several pages of talk bringing the close to a murder just to get it over with.

"I give Archer Mayor credit, there had to be a great deal of study into Asian gangs in our country and in Canada for this book to be written. It was very well put together. The writing was excellent. When things were happening you could almost feel like you were there. On the road, behind a door or in the air you felt like you were part of what was going on.I gave it a three star because of really two things. I thought the length of the book was a little long. I kept thinking it was coming to an end and it would take off on something else. The second and hardest thing for me was the number of people involved. I had a terrible time keeping them straight. A lot of the same people even had two names and you had to try to remember both of them. I really got lost with the names, then there were task forces set up and even more people were brought in and you had to try to keep up with who they were also. My little old brain can only hold so much and it went into overload.I really like Joe Gunther and his staff in Battleboro and know for the series to continue some it will have to go outside that town but please involve fewer people. I sure hope the next book does.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQXKI92UEKOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3LLRFG#wasThisHelpful","R3LQXKI92UEKOC","A1N01YOBWF8WDP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N01YOBWF8WDP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was undecided about how to rate this one. I nearly gave it a 3 but will give  benefit of doubt and go with a 4. I liked the story and the character except he can do no wrong. Hunt, the hero, knows how to do everything, say all the right things and do all the right things. Never makes a mistake and always has the best advise. That gets a little old. People are just not like that. I think Hunt needs to be more human and not as perfect. However, I am a reader, not a writer and I hope Mr. Cox does well with his series.The book is well written, has a lot of action and is easy to follow Hunt as he goes about his business. It is a good beginning to a series if only he will at least make a wrong decision somewhere.

"I am glad for Ms. Jeppsen that she received so many 4 a 5 star reviews. I hope she does well in the rest of her Deadman Series. I don't plan on being there.The first several pages of this book were some of the sadist I ever remember reading. Everything and anything that could happen bad in this young boys life did so. The writer was good, she made me, at least, feel so sorry for him. Nothing went right.Thirteen years latter he was a Sheriff. He was after the Top Hat gang. Now if you like reading about women, young girls, young boys, teenage boys and even adult men getting raped and then having their throats cut then you will really enjoy this book. Their is a lot of that. I started more than once to quit reading but I keep thinking it would stop, but it kept on.This may have been the way the old west was as several reviewers have said, I have not read any other westerns that pictured it with that much violence and rape of both sexes.I am sorry if what I have written has offended anyone, I am a reader, not a writer and I just know what I like and don't like.

"Over the years I've had success using Miracle Gro gardening products.  Their Nature's Care Garden Disease Control is a great adddition to their lineup.Nature's Care is intended to prevent and treat powdery mildew, rust, black spot, leaf and fruit spot, downy mildew, fruit rot and late blight.  (It sounds as if they were hanging around in our garden last summer.)  It contains the fungicide/batericide copper soap.Like most fungicides/bactericides it's most effective when used for prevention. Miracle Gro suggests spraying both the top and bottom of leaves two weeks before the disease normally appears.  And then at seven-ten day intervals.  It must be re-applied after rain.  Of course for many of us, it's difficult to know that disaster is going to strike in two weeks.  I check my plants daily and when one is striken, I spray all those I think may be at risk.This 22 fluid ounce bottle treats seven square yards.  Gardeners should protect their hands with disposable gloves when spraying.Nature's Care is OMRI listed for organic use and can be used up to the day of harvest.  And can safely be used on flowers, fruits, and vegetables. But it is toxic to fish and aquatic organisms.So far this season we've been pleased with Nature's Care, but the challenging part of summer gardening is yet to come.  We'll see how it does with our brief pop-up showers that raise the humidity, and are followed by blasts of summer sun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJVKRT0NWITS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T64BBVI#wasThisHelpful","R3JJVKRT0NWITS","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Pryor's newest Hugo Marston novel is set in Barcelona, where the former FBI profler/current Paris embassy security chief goes in search of the missing daughter of a close friend.Amy, who has told her father that she's pursuing a modeling career in Paris, has actually been stripping in a seedy club.  When she fails to meet 'uncle' Hugo for breakfast, he and his friends Tom and Claudia follow her trail to Barcelona.This is the fifth book in the series and is pretty much on a par with the others.  Hugo, with his Cary Grant looks  and his Texas cowboy boots, is an interesting creation and has more potential than Pryor has yet exhibited.  He manages to be a bit bland rather than exciting.And as in many mysteries, just going with willing suspension of disbelief rather than focusing on details leads to more enjoyment.I like the Marston series and have read all five books.  And in each book I've found the first third to be a bit slow and the last third to be difficult to put down.So keeping all that in mind, what are Pryor's strengths?  His books are readable; the prose and syntax are both easy to read and flow; there's nothing awkward or cumbersome.  The supporting characters are well-drawn.  The settings are interesting and at no time do I get the feeling that I'm reading research; descriptions are well-integrated into the prose.  The plots are interest-worthy and, as mentioned, suspense builds to a dramatic conclusion.I enjoyed ""The Reluctant Matador,"" but it's time for Pryor to up his game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ASO47I4IM0HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880028#wasThisHelpful","R1ASO47I4IM0HV","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Contigo Glacier Stainless Water Bottle keeps 20 ounces of water cold for up to 18 hours.The stainless steel body is BPA free.  The bright blue color is attractive, however, the color coating is light and easily nicked and scratched.When filled with water the 12.8 ounce container weights in at slightly over 2 pounds.  My filled Camelback 20 ounce bottle weighs 1.6 pounds.  So I find the Contigo more suitable for car trips and picnics rather than walking and the gym.The Contigo has a push button lock that helps protect from spillage. Its one-handed operation is convenient, however the resultant snapping sound is a bit disconcerting.  And an inflexible carry loop folds down over the top.  Frankly, I can't envision using the loop, but others might like it.  I prefer the flexible loop on my regular bottle.The body itself has a wide opening and is easy to fill with ice cubes and water.  The drinking spout is far wider than I'm accustomed to, and I've already had a cold bath on a cool morning from the Contigo.  Perhaps I'll learn caution.  Perhaps not.Purchasers are warned that this bottle is not suitable for hot or carbonated beverages.  And lazy folks like me should note that while the lid can go in the dishwasher's top rack, the body should be washed by hand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R921K6R31FZLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX8JM#wasThisHelpful","R921K6R31FZLH","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The fewer garments packed in the case, the less the likelihood of wrinkles.By packing our clothes in cases, I can attach a sticky label to a packed case and then only remove the cases I need from a suitcase, leaving the others packed until needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXRVAQ9X8727/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9S81KY#wasThisHelpful","R1YXRVAQ9X8727","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monster Octagon In-Ear Headphones have a lot of offer both exercise enthusiasts and casual users.Earbuds to be effective must be 1) comfortable, 2) sturdy, and, most importantly, 3) provide good sound.1) Comfort - Like most quality earbuds, the Octagon comes with various sized earpads and ear attachment pieces.  They're both comfortable and fit securely and I have no problems wearing them for extended periods.  At 3.5 oz. they're light-weight.2) Durability - They appear well-made and are sweat-resistant, a boon to hard exercisers or those doing outside work.  A small zippered carrying case is included; it has room for an I-Pod and will easily fit in pocket, bag, or purse.3) Sound - The sound is balanced, crisp, and clear with a good solid bass.  They're advertised as 'sound insulating' and after an hour at the gym lifting weights and doing the treadmill, I couldn't really notice much lessening of typical gym noises.  I usually wear  Onkyo In-Ear Headphones and I haven't noticed any difference.  Neither insulates from outside sound as well as promised. But the Monster Octagon does offer slightly better sound quality.Octagon offers an Apple friendly inline remote and microphone.  Since I'm a Samsung Galaxy user, I can't comment on its effectiveness.There's a control button on the cord, but it's placed near the left ear and I can't use it unless I unhook it from my ear; others may do better.I'll be using these at the gym from now on, but I don't expect them to block out the sound of the treadmill or the dreadful gym music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3DNIQJ2H4RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNVZY0U#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3DNIQJ2H4RF","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scott-Vincent Borba's Anti-Fatigue Skin Care/SPF 29 Mineral Foundation is an interesting innovation.  The packaging, as far as I know, is unique.  And the accompanying 'foundation tool' is the best makeup brush I've ever encountered.  Frankly for the price, they should both be stellar.  And they come close.The compact allows the user to twist, grind, and mix a fresh batch of mineral foundation each time.  The resultant mix (which looks more like a powder than a cream), is both light and moist.  And there's some user control over the shade achieved.It's then applied with the truly luxurious brush.  The texture of the brush is extremely soft and flexible, yet it holds the powdery mix and delivers it exactly as desired.The foundation is light in feel, long wearing, and according to my spouse, brighter than my usual Lancome.  It doesn't do much for my wrinkles and other imperfections, but works well over my usual cover-up.It's first rate and the brush is fantastic; I like both.  It's fun to try and works well.

"The Omron HJ-327T Alvita Wireless Activity Tracker is Omron's latest entry into the highly competitive fitness tracker sweepstakes.  Omron's is a small, light Bluetooth enabled pedometer that relies on an internet connection and a smartphone app to work.The tiny one-square-inch tracker weighs in at only 45 oz. and can be slipped into a pocket or clipped at the waist.  However, it has to be shaken to be read, then tapped to change the setting from steps to calories burned, aerobic steps, distance or the clock.Anyone comfortable with smartphone use will probably find set up simple; the battery is included and just requires slipping into place.I've used Omron pedometers in the past to track steps and found them simple to use.  But their small size is for me both a pro and a con.  I like slipping it into my pocket, then  worry that I'll send it through the wash.One minor annoyance is that to extend battery life, the tracker face switches off when not being viewed.  To turn it back on, the user must shake it a few times.  That's simple if it's in a pocket, but more difficult if it's clipped on.  An 'on' button would make all this much simpler.The Omron Wireless Activity Tracker is obviously designed with a lower asking price and fewer bells and whistles than many competitors.  Yet it does require smart phone use. It's good at step counting.  I compared it to my Fitbit Charge and Samsung health app.  Wearing all three devices and going for a brief 20 minute walk told me that I'd gone 2106 steps (Fitbit), 2507 steps (Omron), and 2545 steps (Samsung). In reality, of course, the Samsung phone is far too large for me to slip into a pocket and ignore; plus I often don't have a pocket.  The Fitbit is on a bracelet and measures arm movement rather than actual steps. The Omron is much more efficient than the Fitbit at counting the steps I take in Target while pushing a basket and the steps my son takes while pushing a baby carriage as he jogs.  The Omron does have a niche.  It's probably a better step counter than the Fitbit and is so much smaller than the phone.However, the calorie counting element is dubious.  Any dieter will testify, metabolism rates vary with age, gender, and for all I know time of day.  And as I've learned to my dismay,  muscles adjust for daily activity; the 400 calories I once burned on a 45-minute bike ride are now less no matter what the bike fitness tracker says.  No tracker in my price range is a true calorie burn counter.  They are calorie burn estimators.The Omron is a efficient, basic step counter.  Its app provides access to Omron's Wellness.com site that also has exercise plans and users' stored data.  But an 'on' button to activate the face is sorely missed by this user.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAL9KM00K93T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVPNZ9Y#wasThisHelpful","R3IAL9KM00K93T","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Eagle Creek Travel aids for years, and, while I find the packing cubes less helpful than their packing boards, I still find them useful.The cubes in this light-weight set are 4"" x 8"" x 2"", 7"" x 10"" x 2 1/2"" and 10""x14"" x 3.""  Each has a zipper and handle.  I find all the sizes useful for items such as pill containers, pajamas, a spare change of underthings, socks, cords. I find that items such as t-shirts and pajamas pack more efficiently if folded cube size then rolled up. I like that after a long flight I can grab my pajama cube, shower and rest.I travel with my husband and while we each take a suitcase or carry-on, we mix our belongings, so that if one case is lost or delayed, we still have something to fall back on.  The colored cubes make it easy to claim ownership.  We also use them in our carry-ons.  They separate our traveling devices, hairbrushes, etc. from our clothing, and I've never had TSA open a cube and touch the items inside.Budget minded potential buyers may well want to keep in mind that zip or slider top plastic bags can serve the same function and, as an added bonus, are water proof.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL5UJX5HGJIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9S87SA#wasThisHelpful","R2BL5UJX5HGJIP","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrote the review below on April 21; today is May 28 and I've come back to say that my soundbar no longer works.  It switches itself off after  about ten minutes of use.  I had it professionally installed and it worked well for a few weeks, so that's probably not the issue.  I visited Polk's website forum and saw that others have reported the same issue with their sound bars.  The Polk expert responds by suggesting that users unplug the sound bar or call CS.  Keeping the sound bar unplugged when not in use seems to be doing the trick at the moment,  but in reality, Polk should either improve their product or provide instructions to avoid this problem with the product.  I can't justify giving more than one star to a product that worked for about thirty days and then quit or one that requires constant unplugging,This is the original review:The Polk Audio Magni-Fi Soundbar with Wireless Active Subwoofer is as sleek and understated as it is effective.  At 38"" L, 2"" high, and 3"" wide, it sits comfortably below our TV screen, but it can also be easily wall mounted.We compared the sound with our Bose Wave, and the Polk was a tad better.  And with three drivers, it has left, right, and center channels.  The center, voice channel, can be turned up for better defined speaking voices or to lessen background sounds.  And the volume, voice, and base can be adjusted separately using the remote or soundbar buttons.Set up is simple and the setup guide is easy to follow.  The package contains the sound bar, subwoofer, 6' analog stereo cable, 6' optical cable, subwoofer power cable, sound bar power cable/power supply, and remote control (battery included).The remote is small and must be aimed directly at the sweet spot on the soundbar (no waving in the direction of the TV for me; I have to get up and move closer to use the tiny remote).Polk has designed and manufactured a first class soundbar.  Unfortunately they failed to include an adequate instruction manual.  I've had to spend more time than I like at their website learning how to use the system.  So I've downgraded a five star product to four stars.Here is a bit of what you may already know and I've recently learned:  The LED's behind the speaker grill flash and change color but no explanation for the changes is offered.At the website I learned that the orange light indicates optical audio; two orange indicates aux audio; green is Dolby digital; blue is bluetooth audio, and red is off.The TV remote is easy to sync to the soundbar.  Until the TV remote is synced using it will turn off the soundbar. (At least it did at our house.) And once the TV remote was paired, I could stay in my chair and wave in at the soundbar to adjust sound.I synced one Kindle to the soundbar, but when I tried to add a second Kindle I couldn't.  I kept getting messages that the PIN was incorrect.  A call to customer service at 1-800-377-7655 got the quick answer I needed.All of my minor annoyance problems could have been easily covered in a good user's manual.  Polk,  surely it's not too late to add one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2INMU45Y4AAW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O16236I#wasThisHelpful","R2INMU45Y4AAW8","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Miracle-Gro Quick Start Transplanting Solution lives up to its name.  It's easy to apply and gives transplants a better chance at survival.My screen name tells it all.  I'm a lazy gardener.  And even I find this transplanting solution worth the added effort.It can easily be used with a conventional watering can:  just attach  the included spoon to the bottle, fill to the line, and add the liquid to a 2-gallon bucket or can.  Add water and pour at the base of your plants.  One gallon feeds about 10 sq. ft. or one bottle covers 400 sq. ft.  Apply at planting and then again a week later.  For larger areas, it can also be used with a sprayer.The 4-8-4 fertilizer boost it contains helps stimulate root growth and promote flowering, so it increases the plant's chance of survival.Frankly, once I've gone to the trouble to visit the nursery, select plants, bring them home, dig those holes, and plant them - I want them to survive!I think of it as a small insurance policy.  And speaking of that. Miracle-Gro says they will refund the purchase if it doesn't work.  Just send them your proof of purchase.

"Here's a quick look at the pros and cons:Pros:1) The assembly was quick with clear directions for use.2) It weighs 12.6 pounds plus one tank of water.  That's light for a floor cleaner.3) It's cordless, therefore much easier to use.  (This comes with a downside to be discussed later.)4) It does a good job of keeping the clean and dirty water separate with a two tank system.5) There are three modes: wash, dry, scrub.  And switching from wash to dry is simple - it washes as you move forward, dries as it moves back.Cons:1) The PR blurb promises 'fade-free power for the entire life of the battery.'  I discovered that as the battery lost charge, the drying action diminished.By the time I got down to two cells, it was no longer picking up water.2) I couldn't get all my cleaning done on one charge.  We have a small kitchen/breakfast room and one tiny bath and one larger one.  I got about 25 minutes charge (and keep in mind that for half of that my drying action wasn't working).  A new charge takes over an hour; at that point the water is cold and the tanks have to be emptied.3) The cleaner is added by manual action as you move the cleaner forward.  I'm a klutz.  I kept squirting on the backstroke.  For me, there's a learning curve.4) Cleaning out the dirty water tank is much less than pleasant than emptying a mop bucket (which is not on my list of fun chores either).5) I found it clunky to maneuver.  Cordless is great, but it doesn't get under furniture or against the baseboards.Frankly for the price, it should be a bit better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWABGMGAQ4TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU3JG#wasThisHelpful","R2GWABGMGAQ4TH","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ortho Bug-Getaa Snail and Slug Killer, despite its too cute name, is an effective deterrent to slug and snail pests.  (And if there's any garden pest that I loathe, it's slugs.  If you're reading this you probably already know what it feels like to step barefoot on a slug on a cool summer morning.  It's a mood spoiler.)Our combination of hostas, mulch, shade, and moisture seems to be an ideal slug habitat.  And since we feed the birds and have no animus against the chipmunks and rabbits who wander by, we can only use wildlife and pet safe products.Bug-Geta is composed of sulfur with slug and snail bait additives and degrades over time.  The sulfur actually turns into sulfate, which is already present in the soil.  It's no threat to bees and the run off is safe for fish.A light scattering of the small granules is effective for several weeks even after rain or sprinkling. Since the package says 'effective UP TO 3 weeks,' I assume that means 2+ weeks.It's safe for vegetables, berries, fruit trees, citrus, ornamentals, shrubs, flowers, trees, lawns, gardens, and in greenhouses.The single hazard listed is eye irritation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQWK8YLZ73BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6X8OWE#wasThisHelpful","R3RQWK8YLZ73BE","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cosco Avery Line 4-Drawer Classic Kids chest looks like a piece of classic wood furniture in the picture.It acually looks far better than our attempt.  Our version, made from the kit, has a few flaws.1) The feet are indeed wood, but the rest of the chest is particle board.  And according to the USDA, particle board is manufactured as panels from dry wood particles that have been sprayed or dusted (speckled) with a binder resin, and are bonded together with pressure and heat.  Particle board varies in quality and the added coating is key to a 'real' wood look.2) The Avery chest has a very thin coat of veneer.  It came complete with scratches even before we began assembly and managed to add a few scratches of our own.  The veneer is thin enough that a close look shows the particleboard underneath.3) Assembly took more patience that I sometimes displayed (sorry!), but luckily my husband is a veteran of the furniture assemble wars.  (He's done bookcases, consoles, tables, shelves, planters....)  But this was the most difficult job so far.  The screws and particleboard are both soft and really easy to strip. The pieces are heavy and it often required two of us to hold the pieces together and screw them together.4) Our drawers don't always stay on the gliders.  Perhaps we did something wrong?5)  And, and for me this is the clincher, once assembled, the chest manages to be both heavy yet not sturdy.I understand that particleboard and wood are not in the same price point and that many people need an inexpensive chest.  But unfortunately this one comes with numerous drawbacks.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PFW6DHQK9WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O32ZXG2#wasThisHelpful","R34PFW6DHQK9WR","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In January, 2009, I purchased a Philips Sonicare Essence electric toothbrush from Amazon.  And although Philips has moved on to other models, my original Sonicare is still going strong.  I expect the new Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus to live up to this standard.The Flexicare has five brushing modes:  clean, gumcare, refresh, sensitive, and massage.  I asked my dentist and his hygenist if the massage mode was safe to use and got a resounding 'yes!'  In fact, this is the same electric toothbrush that the hygenist recently purchased.She suggested that if the new bristles seem a bit too firm, that running warm water over them for a few minutes while they're new would help.I prefer the slim handle that this model has (my old one was  bit clunky).  And I like the interval timer.  To be honest, it's the only way that I brush for a full two minutes.  And the interval beeps do help me give each section its due.  My dentist commented that some of his more zealous patients tend to overbrush (so not my problem!) and that the shut off after two minutes is a worthwhile precaution.Philips says that the battery lasts three weeks between charges and they include a plastic travel case for the brush heads.And speaking of brush heads, they do need to be replaced after three months of regular use.My check ups truly have improved since I've been using a Philips Sonicare and my teeth really do look whiter and feel smoother.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7OSMVW8QALU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67O6G#wasThisHelpful","R3S7OSMVW8QALU","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lyric Chickadee Wild Bird Mix is a quality blend of shelled and unshelled black oil and striped sunflower seed with shelled peanuts, pecans, and pistachios.  It is composed primarily of unshelled sunflower seeds.We normally use black oil sunflower seed (as suggested by a national university sponsored bird counting program we participate in), so it was with great interest that we tried this far more expensive blend.We saw no difference in feeder activity.  Our feeders are visited throughout the day by mixed winter flocks of chickadees, titmice, cardinals, wrens, and a variety of finches.Our feeder birds have always preferred the black oil sunflower seed to the striped, and this is holding true.So for us, this seed blend costs more than twice what we are accustomed to paying.  (Twenty-five pounds of black oil sunflower seed sells here atAmazon for about $25.)On the other hand, those who live in more wooded areas are far more likely to have visits from nuthatches and woodpeckers who will be quite pleased to see the shelled nuts and seeds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYH2DEMCD9HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8O6QHG#wasThisHelpful","R2GYH2DEMCD9HV","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The T.S. Shure Pictorial Map of the United States was a winner with our six-year-old grandson.At 24"" high and 35"" wide, it's large enough to display and small enough for a bedroom wall.  It's brightly colored, and visually interesting, with cartoons representing state birds, flowers, and sites.  Grommets in each corner and a lightly laminated finish make it easy to hang.

As a distant grandmom, I especially like the 'my grandmom live here' sticker, but also appreciate the options offered by the blank circles with '______lives here.'The PR accompanying the item suggests that it is suitable for ages 36 months to 15 years.

"On first glance, the SABRE Home and Personal Alarm Kit sounds as though it will provide a bit of extra safety.  However, most of the elemets just don't work for me.The Door Stop Alarm can't be used with our doors.  The doors are fitted so tightly into the sill that we can't slide the alarm in.  So potential purchasers may want to try sliding a flat screwdriver under theirs to see if it fits.  And if we could slide it in, the angle to the hardwood floor would be fairly high and woud affect its steadiness.  (This may be a one off problem just for our house.)The Window Alarm comes with batteries installed and on the right window should be easy to install.  I used these in the past in my mother's apartment and she liked them.  However, we have double hung windows and haven't been able to get the connection right. (I had no idea we were buying such a persnickety house.)  There's a 15 mm connection limit (that's about 9/16 of an inch), so again potential purchasers may want to measure first.The Personal Alarm can fit on a key ring or can hold keys on the included ring.  Again, battery included.  Like the other alarms, it sounds at 120 decibels and sounds a lot like a car alarm.  And that may be part of the problem.  I've never seen anyone rush to aid or stop a sounding car alarm.  The small flashlight is easy to use, but the alarm itself requires two handed operation.  It weighs less than an ounce and is 1/2"" thick, 2.5"" long, and 1.5"" wide.

It looks like they may last the full year.The size is generous -  20x30 inches.  And since they're preshunk, after washing they retained their full size and color.They're also soft and absorbent.  Company PR credits the 'twisted yarn' and high density weave. I often use terry towels, but I find these equally absorbent and much better on glassware.The stitching appears firm and I'm not anticipating frayed ends, and thanks to that high density weave, I have hopes that they will hold up with use.And I like the bright aqua color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJD1RN0DLUYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R8YJG#wasThisHelpful","R3NJD1RN0DLUYI","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The time has come for a Bluetooth fob that helps locate lost objects.  But unfortunately the KiiTAG-B was released before the functions were fine tuned.The Bluetooth enabled plastic key is placed on a keyring, in a backpack, or carry-on (the potential is limitless) and communicates through a smart phone app.  So in theory, when I misplace my keys or walk away from my carry-on at the airport, an alarm will sound on my phone and I can use the 'find' page on the app to locate the object.  I'm led to the object through a method similar to playing the 'hot/cold' childhood game.  So if I'm lucky the app leads in the general area of my lost item. (The keys are somewhere in the bureau, the missing wallet is somewhere in this group of strangers, etc.)It's truly an idea whose time has come.  However....The finder key is light-weight but bulky.  If it's on my keyring, I can no longer slip it into the usual compartment of my purse.It's advertised as working up to 200 feet, but I'm actually getting lower numbers.  It's best within a 100 feet.  Both this and the size rule it out as an addition to my dog's collar.  (Dear KiiTAG, I'd love an affordable activated dog collar with a greater range.)I found installing the battery to be far from easy; the cover piece on mine doesn't fit well.  And battery life seems to be much shorter than usual.Now add to that that the alarm doesn't consistently work when the item goes out of range.  The fault may lie with my phone for all that I know, but I do know that it decreases my confidence in the KiiTAG.Three stars - there may be potential buyers who have far more patience than I and are willing to put up with the kinks.  I'll be waiting for the next model.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JI1QSVUY4LJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDDJLEK#wasThisHelpful","R1JI1QSVUY4LJ8","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fitbit PR says that the Charge will stay attached (if properly joined), but I'm so not a trusting buyer.  So when my daughter and I each bought a Charge about a month ago, I bought a Bilbelt for my Charge.And good mother that I am, I gave my daughter the spare.We both still have our Charges, but there was That Incident where one of us spent a hour or two at work trying to locate her lost Charge. It was found and now we're both Bitbelted in place.But if potential buyers are wondering if the Bitbelt is easy to use, it's not.  I really find sliding the band through the small clasp to be both awkward and  time  consuming.  So I wear my Charge (with Bitbelt in place) just loose enough to slide over my hand.  When I want to wash my hands, I can then slide it up on my arm.

"Welcome to Anne Tyler's Baltimore.  It's not a land of magic, nor of super people who jet from place to place, nor the dark land of gritty noir fiction.  Tyler's Baltimore is peopled by real folks, average in their accomplishments, unremarkable in their everyday activities.  But through Tyler's lens we come to know them, understand them and their stories, and in so doing we learn a bit about ourselves.The Whitshank family is the centerpiece of ""A Spool of Blue Thread.""  There's Abby and Red who live in the Whitshank family home, and as the novel opens are facing their final years.  Age brings a gradual decline that threatens them and frightens their adult children.  But change is inevitable.Tyler's view shifts through the various stages of their lives, and the reader comes to know how Abby and Red became the people that they are.  But because this is a novel and not a history, our view is not chronological, but rather is carefully arranged by Tyler, who skillfully exploits our perspective. (Like the man on the flying trapeze, it looks so easy because it's so skillfully done!)Part of the beauty of reading Tyler is that the words seem to flow from her pen effortlessly.  But in reality it's a tightly interwoven plot that introduces the reader to the stories of three generations and the family myths and misunderstandings that have developed over the years.In their way Tyler's novels are gritty and real.  This is real life as lived by real people.  Tyler offers no false promises; all dreams aren't achieved and living brings pain as well as joy.  However, no one stands alone;  her characters are capable of growth and change, and, most of all, no matter where they are, they are a part of the fabric of family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VN7UWD78YN30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874279#wasThisHelpful","R3VN7UWD78YN30","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our new Black and Decker 12-Cup Thermal coffee maker is a fair mid-priced coffee maker, but it's not the coffee maker of my dreams.  Here's a quick list of the pros and cons from my point of view.Pros:1) It's attractive with a small footprint.  At 12.75 inches tall, it fits under our kitchen cabinets for storage.  The stainless steel and black fits in well in our kitchen.2) It's easy to set up and program.3) The carafe is sturdy, pours well, and is easy to clean.  The carafe and brew basket are both dishwasher safe.4) It can make up to 12 cups, yet it's easy to sneak a cup as needed.5) And it can be programmed for three brew strengths.Cons:1) The brew basket works best with a paper filter.2) The time display lacks a backlight and is difficult for my tall husband to see.3) There's no battery backup for the programming, so when the lights blink, the program is lost.4) Steam escapes from the back of the unit when the end of the cycle is reached.5) A brewing of 12 cups of coffee set at 'Strong' requires 25 minutes.6) And most importantly for us, the brew temperature isn't as high as we'd like.  The National Coffee Association suggests a brewing temperture of 195-205 F; the B&D coffee maker doesn't seem to reach that temperature.  After it's brewed, our coffee about 180 F.  (I do understand that hitting the grounds cools the water a bit.)May I suggest that potential purchasers read a few of the one star reviews.  It seems that initially a few of the units had issues.

"The blue 1888 Naked Brand 6 piece bath set is soft and smooth.  And while color preference is personal, I like the light blue.Soft, absorbent towels seem easy to find in department stores, but few seem to hold up after repeated washings.  Most cotton towels now appear thick and lush before that initial washing, then the waste fibers that have been added to thicken the pile turn loose and each time I wash there's less towel.  The 1888 towels are a cotton/modal combination; I did notice fiber loss after the first trips through the washer, but it was not as bad as many 100% Egyptian cotton towels that I've purchased in the past.  Modal is a rayon derived from birch, so it should be safe to use.The towels have proven absorbent, yet the lighter weight (thanks to the modal) shorten dryer time.While these are not the luxury towels of my dreams, they don't come at luxury prices.  They're smooth and soft, and dry well.  The true test of a towel comes with repeated use.  And at this point, I can't speak to that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FBBLZHOUZHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OB9CPTU#wasThisHelpful","R10FBBLZHOUZHJ","A1QK0XCAPHIW1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK0XCAPHIW1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He's used Dove deodorant a lot before and liked it.This could be a strange 'gift' since it's drugstore products, however, if someone gave me a ladies version, I'd be happy enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUZFLM2JPRCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K58PKV6#wasThisHelpful","R2QUZFLM2JPRCV","A1MAI0TUIM3R2X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MAI0TUIM3R2X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TL;DR Very heavy duty and high quality, nicely colored, but packaging is not idealThis Stainless Steel Bracelet, out of the box, is very shiny and does not smudge much. The purple color is very nice, and is light enough as to not look strange.The packaging was a bit frustrating, as the plastic on the bracelet itself was somewhat difficult to rip off, but once i did get it off, it looked rather nice.This bracelet is very heavy, and feels like it has some substance to it, but the clip took me a while to figure out, but that is likely just because of my lack of experience.The gift box is simple, with square patterns in a black box, with some paddingOver all, this bracelet is very cool, and i will give it a 4/5","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2SLG4NQ9H6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z5HSY42#wasThisHelpful","R3F2SLG4NQ9H6D","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say, I was fairly skeptical of these. However, they do get the job done.Our first use was with a London Fog raincoat. My husband had managed to get ketchup all over the lapel and on the inside. It was totally soaked in and crusty. Oh, did I mention he did this two years ago? And it sat in the trunk of his car, in Texas, for all that time.So into the washer it went along with both Wash Balls. When it came out: No ketchup, no stain. Basically, it looked like new.The next test was daily usage. We've been using them for 2 months now and they are doing a good job. For the adults in my house, the Wash Balls do a good enough job to keep our clothes fresh and clean, including our whites. The kids, however, well....

"I have three dogs and all of them seem to really like these. I'm not as impressed with them, but since they like them so much I hand them out sparingly. These are definitely junk food treats - wheat is the first ingredient and sugar is the third. So, I suppose, OF COURSE the dogs love them :) The exterior ""crust"" is crunchy and the interior is still a little crunchy but softer. The problem with the exterior is that it flakes off pretty easily. When I opened the bag, I noticed several that the coating had cracked off of. Not a huge deal, but if you're a stickler, (or - like me - have a touch of OCD twitchiness) it will make you crazy.We have two small chihuahuas and one small/medium terrier/mini-schnauzer mix. The terrier loves them dearly and will do any trick I ask for them. The chihuahuas love them and will grab the whole thing and run off to a corner to munch it down piece by piece.Bottom line for me? As an occasional treat, yes, we would get them (however, they are other junk food snacks they like more), but as a daily treat, we'll stick to other things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDUIMON5I9HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T62YLWG#wasThisHelpful","R1VDUIMON5I9HE","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the bad - my dog managed to kill the squeaker in this toy within thirty minutes. But that's not all that unusual, really.The odd part is that he still loves playing with it. Usually once he's killed it, it's pretty much ""dead to him"" and he's done with it. This ball still holds up well, even after your pooch has de-squeaked it. It still makes a funky whoosh-whoosh noise and I think he likes that because he'll walk around with this in his mouth for hours stopping to ""whoosh"" it.It is pretty heavy duty as far as the ball itself. Even with him gnawing on it, he hasn't managed to get any pieces off of it in the past week that we've had it. We do take it away from him after a while.I went out and bought the ChuckIt stick and I have to tell you that I'm in love with this whole system. Having had two spinal surgeries, bending down repeatedly starts to hurt. Throwing a ball with my dog wasn't something I was really able to do. Now, I can. It takes a few times to get the hang of picking it up with the stick, but once you do it, it's super easy and super simple.But back to this particular ball - we like it. The squeak didn't last - but really - I have yet to get a squeaker toy that the dog cannot destroy, sadly. The ball still makes a noise and every time we grab it, Anton jumps up and the tail wags and the eyes smile. I'd say that's as good as it gets.... now if he'd bring it back on a consistent basis (we're working on it!) :)Bottom line, it's a great ball, but it's even better if you have the chuck it stick/wand thing.

"I absolutely love this little heart necklace. The photo truly does not do this piece justice. I have to admit that when I first noticed Amazon sold jewelry, I was kind of wary. I remember worrying about if it was going to be junky. I don't know why I worried because the quality of the pieces have all been magnificent! This was no different.The chain is pretty think and delicate, absolutely perfect for the design. A heavy chain would take away from it. What I found interesting is that the gold flakes kind of float in there. They don't move much at all. In fact if I hadn't tilted it and the little air bubble moved through them to move them around, I wouldn't have noticed. It must be some sort of thick liquid in there or something. Anyway, now it's kind of a distraction game when I wear this, I sit there playing with the gold flakes.Yes, I have found a way to fiddle with nearly everything, I know.

It seems we're stuck with black and white or spending some serious money for high end bright products.

I have to tell you that this thing is a gorgeous orange. It's not neon burn your eyeballs out bright, but it's a nice subtle beautiful orange.BUT this is more than just a pretty scale. The lines are sleek and modern and it work SO well. I love that it zeros itself out by magic and never misses. I also love that the display is bright and large enough that I can read it - even first thing in the morning before my coffee and before I've located my glasses.One of my absolute favorite features of this scale is that the body of it longer than most. For some reason, the scales I see are square, which makes NO sense. This one leaves enough room for whatever items you're looking to weigh and the display. It's a flat unit, there's nothing to snag when you're moving around and it's super easy to clean.This is one of those items that we got in for review, it went into our lives and it's stayed there.

"One of the keys to learning a skill is repetition. This is true whether you are learning to play violin, learning you multiplication tables, or just learning to count! But at least with learning music you get to try different songs. With your multiplication tables you can switch up the order. Learning to count? A lot of the practice comes from having a lot of things to count!My husband is a teacher and he says these come in really handy because each number has it's own thing to count. Have a child that can count but doesn't know the look of the numbers? Have him find the right one, trace it with his finger, and write it on his own. Have children at different skill levels? Split the magnets between them and have them put their group in order.The colorful images also help keep children's focus on the magnet and away from other things going on in the room. The size is just big enough to be easy for children to hold, but small enough so the entire set fits in its easy to store and tote container.These have been used for 30 minutes a day for the the last month and look like they haven't been out of the box.Overall: 4 stars.

My daughter had a big recital coming up and I wanted to get her something special, but I didn't want to give her flowers afterwards and I didn't want to give her something not related to her violin. I came on here looking for ideas and I stumbled across this. I figured the rosin would be sub-par, but I wasn't worried about that, it was the idea of it that drew me to it.When I gave it to her, she was thrilled! It took her a few minutes to figure out that it opened and rosin was inside.

"These are just what you would expect. Cheap retainer cases. But I was pleasantly surprised. For the price, I thought these would be much more flimsy than they are. They actually hold up really well. I have two kids in retainers and they are always losing retainer cases. We find them eventually, but in the meantime, they are wrapping it up in a napkin then picking the napkin bits off.

"We've had several remote control airplanes in the house, but this is our first Quad. I have to say, the experience is much better than I expected.First: You can actually fly this thing inside! (Our first experience with a plane ended up with it in a tree. It is still there, 4 years later.)Second: The controls are very easy to learn! (Our next experience with a plane ended up smashing it into the door of the car, breaking the propeller that we never replaced.)Third: Setup was zero! (Our last airplane required us to put it together. It never flew.....ever.....very sad.)I was also very impressed by the ""Flip"" function. You click the stick, and it does a mid-air flip.

"First, I think it is important to recognize: there are not enough blocks in this set for it to really be ""stand alone"". I think it should have been called a ""starter set"" or ""add on"".That said, Mego Bloks Fairytale Table is pretty awesome for what it is. It is nice to see a set that is aimed purely at imagination instead of the same old ""dump truck"" or ""factory"" style sets.The table provides a nice work area and keeps the blocks off the floor. While they are much larger than blocks meant for older children, trust me, they can still hurt your feet!The colors are a nice touch. Pastel, flowery, and glittery bricks really help bring the princess motif to life.Overall: 4 stars.

"This toy is a nice addition to any child's toy box. It inspires imaginative play and lets the child play the hero! We are first thought that have two cars of such different size would take away from the overall set, but instead, it seems to add new scenarios for the young mind.The set is rugged and the big locking pieces say together really well even when played with constantly. More road pieces would have been nice, but we understand that this is meant to just be part of the Vtech world. The other Vtech playsets can be connected to this one.One warning: The ""smart points"" do not have a lot of different sounds. Get ready to hear a lot of the same thing over and over. You can take out the batteries, but part of the allure for the child are the sounds. We quickly found replacement batteries when my nephew went to play with it and thought it was broken.Overall: 4 Stars. Great first Smart Wheels playset or addition to an existing Smart Wheels world. Just have some earplugs around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0348SA0ELIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K89KKRQ#wasThisHelpful","R1P0348SA0ELIA","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We borrowed a baby and a toddler to check this one out and he gave it a thumb and a half up. It's VERY sturdy and for a baby that's just learning to pull himself up, he didn't fall over once because of it. The two had a great time, the big bright buttons draw their attention and the music gives them something to ""baby dance"" to. I found the microphone annoying. It doesn't do a great job with voice changing and once my husband got ahold of it, I really really hated it. It's a bit loud and distorted and really... just not good quality. The rest of it is fabulous though. Adjustable heights so varied that it can be used by a sitting or standing child. And hey, who doesn't like jamming out to Let It Go?Recommended for busy babies and toddlers.

"This is a really cool idea, but... I'm not sure that it was needed, really. Don't get me wrong, it's cute. You can write messages on the bullets and shoot them at someone that can read them, if they have the secret reader part. I mean, I could see kids using it to send secret messages across the backyard to their neighbors, but it's a novelty that quickly wears off. The gun itself is nice enough, but for the price, my girl would rather have a ""real"" Nerf gun, not the girly one. She liked it, she played with it and the messages a few times, but abandoned it pretty quickly for her gun with a clip so she could do some real damage.

"Wow! I must admit that I was very leery of getting jewelry from Amazon. I usually want to see it in person. I'm super picky about what I wear. I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured I'd give it a go. I love small pieces like this. The length is absolutely perfect on me. It really is just a wonderful little piece. I love the ""dancing"" in the middle too. It makes it a little more interesting.The chain is actually thinner that I thought, which ended up being a good thing. It looks really good with the pendant. I've found that if the chain is too thin or too thick, it makes the whole thing look odd. But this really is a perfectly put together piece. I know I'll be wearing this both casually and when I need just a little color to off set something more formal.I wore this yesterday with jeans and a shirt and last night with a black cocktail dress. Both were the perfect match. I love that it's versatile like that. My favorite was the black dress though. The splash of red just really brought my entire outfit together. The movement from the middle stone is a great conversation starter too!Recommended for the jewelry lover in your life.

"I cannot tell you how many times I've played the regular Taboo game. Family, friends, any gathering really. It's one of those tried and true ones that we pull out when there's a group together. Most people already know how it works and if they don't, it's easy to explain - especially if there's wine involved!I was really excited when I saw this. One of my favorite games - portable!But... it didn't live up to what I would have liked. Yes, it's small and portable. Yes, it's impressive that they were able to do it, but I'm not sure it works. The buzzer and button placement is awkward. It's a little odd to reach over and hit the button on the top if you're sitting next to someone. I really wish it had some sort of detachable buzzers on cords or something. This could easily be something to play ""on the road"" if it had a few changes.It's still the same game. There's a limited number of turns because... well, it's small. I don't see a way to load more cards, which would be another great feature, have a side loadable cartridge or something, hey, they could even sell me ""theme"" packs for new words. I'd totally go for something a little risque for my girl's night out and something Disney for the kids night in.I dunno. I was overall a little disappointed. Does it work? Absolutely! Does it work well? Nah...Recommended for diehard Taboo fans that absolutely MUST take it with them.

You'll be happier.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BKNTNTFW100/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFWSMMS#wasThisHelpful","R21BKNTNTFW100","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I shared these with a friend of mine's dogs. My dogs are smaller than hers and loved them as well, but this is what she had to say about them:My dogs will eat just about anything unfortunately they also have some crazy allergies such as chicken, duck and turkey.  Finding dog treats with reasonably natural ingredients is relatively easy to find but finding treats with no chicken is difficult.  When I found these I was excited to try them since the puppy is in training and I like to reward him with treats occasionally.These treats are small and my dogs are medium and large so it’s just a little taste for them.  They are great for training so we’ll definitely be using them for that.  As far as an everyday treat these are pretty small so it’s not so much a treat for them as a swallow.I’m picky about ingredients and watch their food closely so these are a winner in that regard.  Their usually treats are ice cubes (they love them) and vegetables from the fridge but those are a little harder to carry around when working on obedience.The real test for me is smell and feel.  These don’t have a bad odor and they aren’t slimy (another issue I’ve had with other dog treats that were chicken-free).  They are moist so be sure to store them out of heat and direct light, they will mold and get hard.Recommended for training sessions and pet owners who are picky about their dog’s food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QLOM2MCUOY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTCVL2U#wasThisHelpful","R8QLOM2MCUOY9","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family has always been fairly energy conscious. We first switched to CFL bulbs a few years back but the lack of instant on, long warm up time, and the upfront cost has constantly disillusioned us. About 6 months ago we started transitioning to LED bulbs in the house, but this is our first exterior lamp purchase.Is it instant on? Yes.Does it have to warm up? Nope.And I would have to say that the light quality is just as good as the incandescent bulb it replaced.But is it worth paying 12x the cost of a similar incandescent?Well, obviously I haven't had this bulb that long, but looking at the warranty and the ratings:Kobi LED: 12 wattsCompetitor Incandescent: 60 wattsAre you really going to notice $3 a year (or so) in energy savings? (Maybe, maybe not)Kobi LED: 25,000 hoursCompetitor Incandescent: 2,000 hoursEven if you don't save any money on electricity, the two pretty much break even.Where I see the biggest advantage is in security and convenience: If you leave this light on for 9 hours every night you should not have to replace it for almost 8 years. Mine is only on when it is needed, maybe 4 hours a night, max. If everything go right, this bulb could last as long at 20 years. My grandparents talked about bulbs that last this long, but I've certain never seen one.But I'm looking forward to it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SWEG9F9YWRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9CRJ1U#wasThisHelpful","R10SWEG9F9YWRA","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a kid I took up archery for a few years with my father. 20 years later, I picked up the Nerf Mega ThunderBow Blaster. I have to say it is fun to play with, but has very little in common with the real thing.Feel: Unlike a lot of Nerf's blasters, the ThunderBow feels like a toy. The balance feels off and it isn't easy to carry. Firing position is easily held though, and the grip is good for right- or left-handed people. When pulling back to fire I was always a little worried: Far enough to fire? Go too far and the arms feel a little creaky. There is a green indicator for when it is ""just right"" but it isn't readily apparent.Looks: I think it looks pretty cool, but once again, but you have to suspend a lot of disbelief to see it as a ""blaster"".Range: Raising the firing angle, you can easily get 90 to 100 feet.Accuracy: Accuracy was definitely worse than the last Nerf model I tried out. At 40 feet I consistently hit within 3 feet of my target. 30 feet was not much better. I feel that the larger projectiles and the ""whistle effect"" really kill the accuracy on this model.Things I liked:- While it may (or may not) effect accuracy, the whistle effect is cool.- It definitely has a different look than other blasters.-Rapid fire of the individual darts.-Five extra projectilesThings I didn't like:- Watch out for the string! It may not be a real bow, but if you hit your forearm enough times it starts to sting.- No place to store the extra projectiles.- No way to easy reload all 5 darts.Overall: 3 stars. Interesting idea, I can definitely see that it has a place in some peoples Nerf arsenal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GM6HFBLNNQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILD5ATY#wasThisHelpful","R21GM6HFBLNNQP","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, the pictures do not do this ""blaster"" justice. It is big and looks impressive, even in the hands of an adult!Looks: As stated above: Impressive! The bright orange still keeps it from looking too real, but you feel pretty invulnerable holding this thing.Comfort: I would say this is just right for a medium size 11 to 13 year old. The stock is a little too short for adult arms, but the hand grip is too large for smaller children. The children pictured on the Amazon page are just right.Range: You can definitely get 90 feet out of the small darts by raising your firing angle. The ""missile"" We were able to get 50 feet. However, these are maximum ranges with the darts that come with the blaster. You can forget about accuracy at that range.Accuracy: After getting used to the ""Missile"" we were able to consistently get within a foot of the target at 40 feet. The standard darts were spot on target at 30 feet, at 40 feet 8 out of 10 were on target. At 50 feet 5 out of 10 were within 1 foot of the target. Overall, I consider this a fairly accurate blaster with good range.Extra goodness:- Extra missile- Storage for missile in the stock- Dual trigger safety feature- Clip has to be inserted for triggers to workQuestionables:- Banana clip unnecessarily large for 10 darts max capacity- Loading the missile is not easy or intuitive(Note: Do not try to load the missile while holding the blaster in firing position, the fins can be separated from the missile by the missile barrel if you aren't careful.)Overall: 4 stars. Impressive looking and fun. The missile is a nice addittion.

"My dogs love chewy things and I love the idea of not brushing their teeth. In fact, I hate brushing their teeth and even though the vet says we should, I will admit that we rarely do. I'm sorry, but I'm just NOT going to make it part of my nightly routine. It just ain't not happening over here, folks.My terrier/dachshund isn't really picky so he LOVES these things. He'll do anything for them, sit, shake, even do his little 360 turn dance on his hind legs. My female chihuahua turned her nose up to them, but she turns her nose up at everything unless it's a nice brie or sharp cheddar cheese because she's a diva. BUT the real test of a doggie treat is my male chihuahua. HE loved them too. I gave it to him and sniffed, grabbed it and hid under the table. I found him with it standing up between his paws and he was happily gnawing away.I was pretty happy with the ingredient list and the packaging was easy to open and reseal. A great find and one I suspect we'll be purchasing on a regular basis.

"We bought this case for my nephew. He can be pretty hard on phones and we wanted to get something that would protect the phone but still be stylish and easy for him to use.Looks: The case looks great. The red and black combination was stylish but colorful enough that the phone could easy be seen when he put it down on his desk or at the table.Feel: The case feels a little cheap. It definitely did not feel sturdy prior to putting it on the phone. Even after, you really didn't feel like you were holding a $300 piece of equipment. However, it did give good grip on the phone.Functionality: This was the killer in the end for my nephew. The case covers the buttons and just ended up making them too hard to use. No one wants to sit and fiddle with the power button or the volume controls. You just want the screen to turn on.In the end, he took the cover off because it was too much hassle.

"In our home and office we use our printer for many things:1.) I use it for work and I usually need what I print quickly.2.) My husband prints things for his classes at school, so the ink can't be too expensive.3.) The kids use it for more things than I thought possible, both color and black and white.We use the printer wirelessly over our wifi. Even though it is the furthest device from the router, it has not had a single problem with communication: each print job goes through seamlessly. Speaking of wifi: the setup was very simple through the large touch screen. Follow the instructions and done.Speedwise: As I said, I am often printing on the run. I am used to the slow inkjets from the past, and the 4640 really surprised me. At standard settings the printer easily spits out 20 black and white pages in less than a minute.Flexibility: We use many different types of paper and materials to print. The 4640 has two feeder trays and a rear feeder as well. We have printed on several types of paper, card stock, and even printable plastic sheets with no bleeding of color or deformation of the page.Ink storage: The 4640 uses 4 different ink tanks, so you can replace all or just one as required. The tanks are also large, so you should not have to be replacing them very often.Scanning: You have a couple of options when it comes to scanning. You can scan to an inserted usb drive or to a computer on the network. Scanning can be a little slow, but it really depends on the user to select the correct settings.Overall: 5 stars. This is a flexible machine that is great in a small office or busy home environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQM6IGW6NXKQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGETS#wasThisHelpful","RQM6IGW6NXKQL","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 11-year-old daughter has really gotten into sketching recently and has gone through several different drawing pencils - starting with the yellow wood school pencils and finally settling on the Tombow brand. I ordered these for her to add to her art arsenal and this is one we don't regret. They are fabulous for getting clean smooth lines, they do NOT smudge (how do they DO that?!?!). The awesome part is the eraser. It's tiny. No, it's TEENY-TINY - which simply means that's awesome.The eraser that comes in this set is pretty small, we have a separate eraser pen thing that she uses and it's fantastic for getting into those small spaces in your sketch to eraser something. The downside is because they ARE so small, you go through them pretty quickly, but that's the price we pay for art, I suppose.Recommended for artists that can draw a mean wolf :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRF65C76J3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRLV1YI#wasThisHelpful","R1WRF65C76J3W","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grabbed my kids and said ""Let's play!"". I have an 11, 13 and 15-year-old. Now that they are older, board games are more fun because we're not endlessly playing Candy Land. This is a great game for pre-teen through senior because the directions are pretty easy (once you figure out what they are saying, it's very easy to play) and it's not a super long game. We played three rounds and it took about 40 minutes. It is a game of strategy, and a little luck. It reminds me of Connect Four a bit.All of us enjoyed it and we'll pull it out of the game night cabinet again, for sure. There's enough strategy that you can play it over and over again and still have fun. The downside is that if you want to get your kids to hang out with you for more than hour, this isn't the way to do it. After a few rounds, it loses its luster and it's time to move on.Having said that, this is definitely staying in the game cabinet, we had a great time and it's a fabulous way to turn off the televisions, computers and phones and spend a little time together.

"I'm a myCharge fan. Over the years, I've purchased several myCharge products. My favorite ones have the built in cords so you don't have to worry about being without a charging cord. I was hesitant to try this one because I'm pretty much married to that mobile battery. My entire family has various mobile chargers (why is that teens can NOT remember to charge their precious phones?!?!?) so we're very familiar with all types of these.Overall, we liked the quality and the size. It was perfect for tossing into a kid's backpack when heading out for the day, knowing they would be able to charge their phone to get in touch with us after spending hours on a bus, watching videos on it. What really impressed us, though... the time. Man, this thing charges pretty quickly for such a small device! A phone from completely discharged to fully charged took less than two hours.When I go to week long conference, I always take two mobile chargers, they are great for your tablet/phone while taking notes or whatever else you may be doing. Conferences are usually very long days, at least 12 hours. So having this with you makes you not only the smart girl for not having to hunt down a preciously few outlet, but it also helps strike up conversations. Several times, I've sat down at a table and had someone there hunting for an outlet (to no avail) and offered to let them juice up their device with my mobile charger. It's a great ice-breaker to conversation.But, bottom line? This thing just works. If you want more power, look at the 9000 mAh Power Bank by this same company, but for quick on-the-go charging, this can't be beat.Recommended for everyone that's ever had to say ""oh darn, my battery is dead!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHWMIL49G9RLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIJUC0M#wasThisHelpful","RHWMIL49G9RLN","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Indoor floods can be great for spotlighting, but can also lead to a harsh glare if they are installed in 8 foot or lower ceilings.

They update the look as well as the light-level.It took about 3 minutes to install, most of which was getting the ladder from the garage.I love the look and the light and we are in the process of getting 4 more to replace the rest of the can-type fixtures in the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M83AY3UWJO1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPBDL9W#wasThisHelpful","R3M83AY3UWJO1E","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bulb provides good color and light. Others have mentioned a delayed start, but I have this bulb in a walk-in closet (single bulb fixture) and haven't noticed it.My only real complaint is the shadow cast at the bottom of the globe of the bulb itself. In a fixture where the bulb is mounted sideways it looks like you have a bulb out. However, in a fixture where the bulb is pointed straight down this is not an issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCSHDRSDL018/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHJGPBS#wasThisHelpful","RSCSHDRSDL018","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that more and more devices are looking to become ""Swiss Army Knives"". That is to say, they fulfill more than one role. Lets look at the roles for this product one at a time:Portable Charger: 4000 mAh battery. This capacity works well for a moderately used device, but not so much for tablets or for heavily used phones. However, as an bonus feature, it comes it very handy.Portable Router: While most hotels now have wifi, it can be a pain to set it up on every....single....device every time you get back to the room. Especially if you are traveling with your family. Set this router up on the hotels connection and your family can connect to it when you get back to the room with no hassles.File access: Plug in a usb drive and you have instant access to those files on any device connected to the router. Doing a presentation and want to share it? Have your client connect to the router and get them. On a trip and need something to keep the kids busy? MP3s, movies, and more can be stored and shared easily.Overall, I like this product due to it's flexibility. It's not the best at any of it's functions, but it does a lot of things and takes up very little baggage space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XB58XFVVYR7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGLOQ24#wasThisHelpful","R2XB58XFVVYR7I","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"FireTV is basically just what it sounds like: it turns your TV into a giant Kindle Fire.  If you are familiar with other streaming media players, you’ll have an idea of what to expect. FireTV streams video and audio content to your TV from the same providers: Hulu, Netflix, and (of course) Amazon.So let’s go through my first experience:Part One: Opening the box (Queue Thus Sprach Zarathustra.)Ok, I have to say it: Nothing impressive here, sorry Amazon. I have to say that the FireTV is about the most boring looking black box I’ve ever seen. The good news: It completely disappears on your entertainment center.The remote is pretty bare bones looking.  The microphone button grabbed my attention, but otherwise, there are very few buttons.  Can I complain that it is both very black and very small? Yes, I know that “Black is the new Black”, but I’ve already lost it once and I’ve had it for about 2 hours.Ok, enough looky-looky, time to um….hooky-uppy.Part Two: Setup (Where is my “That was Easy!” button?)Power: Check!HDMI Cable: Check!Turn on TV: Check!Wait for it to boot…wait…It’s done: Check! (That was fast!)And done? Check! I’m an Amazon Prime member and my account was already setup on the box and ready to go.Part Three: Interface (“What does this button do?)Actually, it’s not rocket science:The “Home” button takes you back to the home screen.Click the wheel to scroll through options.Hit the button to make your selection.Voice Search: Ok, I will tell you: I am not a big user of voice tech. Really, I hate to use the telephone. I guess I’m afraid the pizza guy is going to tell me “No!” But I can see that with a little getting over my own fears, voice search is going to be awesome! My FireTV correctly heard all three of my queries. One caveat here: Voice Search only pulls up Amazon content. No a huge deal for my family, but maybe for yours. You can always search the old fashioned way like other streaming boxes.Part Four: Video and AudioAs I said, it was easy to hook up. Just plug it in. Video looked great on my 40” TV. Audio was good over our home stereo. The quality did not seem any better or worse than my other HD set top box.The services available to stream from are also pretty standard fare both on the video and audio front.Part Five: Games (“Thousands of games coming…”)This reminds me a bit of the days when I got the original Kindle Fire. Of course, Amazon made good on their promise there, so I have faith that they’ll do the same here. Just a quick view through the list of already available games tells me that there is already a good mix of “approved” titles for the Fire TV, and more are on the horizon.Please do not mistake this for a “NextGen” gaming console. It looks like a good choice to be able to play tons of Android games on your big screen.Overall: 4 stars. Fire TV is a very nice mix of old and new. There are a few puzzle pieces missing, but knowing Amazon, they’ll be filled in quickly!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1845HMC9A1PSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R1845HMC9A1PSF","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read some pretty craptastic cozy mysteries over the past several years. When the author sent this book in with a review request, I let it sit for quite a while. I just couldn't wrap my head around how it wasn't going to make me groan and gouge my eyes out with a spoon.I was sitting around one day looking for something mindless to read because I'd just finished reading a heavy book and needed something light and easy. I thought ""okay, why not"".Oh, boy.This was NOT what I was expecting at all. It actually had a decent plot, a good little mystery with plenty of twists. Yes, you'll pick the ending out pretty quickly, but does it really matter? It's kind of like Psycho meets Mary Kay, but in a good kind of way.The writing was decent, there were a few sections that went on a little bit too long, but overall the author does a great job of moving the story forward and keeping you interested and entertained. It's not going to win a heavy literature award any time soon, but that's not why I read this book. It delivered exactly what it promised.I also liked the cover. Yes, I judge books by their covers.Definitely recommended for cozy mystery readers. You'll figure out the whodunnit, but it won't matter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2KJOBDY8T68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006HCTWVS#wasThisHelpful","RS2KJOBDY8T68","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My book club chose this book. I blame them.Don't get me wrong, the premise of this book is so very sweet. A man forms an informal type of book club with his mother, who is at the end of her life. They trade books and they talk about them and they connect over them.The problem? It tries too hard. It's a little too pretentious. The author talks about books as they he is the authority on them and we, the readers, are barely worthy of talking to (or at). It just comes off as a little too much of a hoity-toity narrative to me. Add in some name-dropping and I finished this one only because it was a book club selection.Avoid, unless you like heavy literature and name drops.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EF3K8N5O8XOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SGM3P4#wasThisHelpful","R3EF3K8N5O8XOH","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes you just need a silly bit of chicklit to scrub your brain from all the heavy stuff... this book does this and does it well. It's like sitting down and listening to a story from one of your best friends with a lot of juicy details.The writing is fantastic, the editing is fabulous, the storyline, while a bit recycled from other books, is interesting and a quick read.A perfect book to take with you on vacation or during a plane ride, easy to put down and pick back up, but interesting enough to keep you coming back.Recommended big time for those who love a bit of good gossip now and then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPW30Y8NCNO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084R06GO#wasThisHelpful","R1DPW30Y8NCNO8","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I seem to be reviewing quite a bit of moisturizing products these days. I'll not think about if that means I'm starting to get older. :)This Argan Oil product was received at no cost to me in exchange for an honest review. I'll tell you that when they asked me to review this, I was skeptical. I've used oil based products in the past and they always left a residue or smelled really horrible or made me itchy. I wasn't really expecting to like this at all.But I did. I have been using it on my hands a few times per day and on my legs after shaving. It soaks in very quickly and doesn't leave an oily residue or mess on your skin. The manufacturer also mentioned that it might have a smell, but I don't find that my bottle has any smell at all - and that's saying something because I'm told I have a super sensitive nose.I have not used this on my hair or scalp. I've been too cautious to because I have a fairly oily scalp already.I did, after just one minute of using it, run my fingers around my phone screen to see if it left a residue. To my surprise, it did not.I do have very dry skin though and this was great to make my skin feel soft - even from just an immediate application. I do wish it was a little more portable - some sort of bottle I could toss in my purse to use right before a meeting when I'll be shaking hands with someone.I had my husband try it - he also commented that it had no smell. He has pretty soft skin and he found it took a bit longer for it to soak into his skin, although I do wonder if it will help with his dry scalp after he shaves it.Overall, I can definitely see myself picking this up again on my own. Recommended for those with dry skin or want smooth silky skin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167LLOK697Z2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5WO2VK#wasThisHelpful","R167LLOK697Z2Q","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some reason we end up with a lot of pencils laying around the house. They are all either a.) brand new or b.) the lead has broken off. Hard to use a pencil when it is in one of those two conditions. The little ""materials box"" pencil sharpeners all tend to get broken or lost. We just don't have the space for a wall mounted hand cranked sharpener and don't want to spend the money on a full size electric. So what do you do?Acme Westcott's ""iPoint USB Pencil Sharpener"" is a nice middle point between a full sized electric sharpener and a small handheld (read ""cheap"") sharpener.Here are some specific thoughts on the product features:USB or Battery: The sharpener seems to work fine on either one. We have more than enough USB ports in my home office, so I doubt we'll ever need to use the battery option, but nice to know it is there.Size: It's about the size of a standard 12 oz. soda can.Cord: The extending USB cord is nice. I just wish that it use a standard USB end on the sharpener side. The round plug makes me thing that USB was an after thought. Using a micro or mini usb connector would let the user make use of cords already plugged in but not in use.Pencil sizes: Only standard sized pencils please. The hole in the top will not accommodate anything else.Pencil types: Most brands of pencils seemed to sharpen fine. The unit even worked with colored pencils. Dollar store and decorative (read ""cheap"") pencils took longer to sharpen (about the same as compared to a standard electric sharpener.Sharpness: The unit never quite got any of our pencils to a sharp point. Brand new pencils were left with a tiny flat spot were the point should be. Dull pencils were left with a still blunt tip. The unit never ""auto-stopped"" as some reviews have said, but it also was no longer doing anything to the pencil.Overall: 3 Stars. It does make pencils ""less dull"" but doesn't quite earn the title ""Sharpener"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VO7VNCEDC7IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL55JQM#wasThisHelpful","R2VO7VNCEDC7IN","AG2YXYIQ8TLTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG2YXYIQ8TLTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes you want to make your phone pretty. Other times, you want to make sure that it is protected. The Pelican Phone Protector is for the latter.Is it pretty? Somebody once said ""In simplicity, there is beauty."" If that is so, then this case is the most gorgeous case I've ever seen. Color choices are limited to two tone solids. They call mine ""Black/Grey"", more like ""Dark Grey/Light Grey"", but really I am not picky. If you really must have a case that is pretty by the standard definition, there is a nice flat area on the back of the case where you can put your stickers, bling, or whatever picture you'd like.I said it was rugged. Have you ever dropped your phone and thought ""Wow, the phone is still perfect, but the case chipped. Guess I need a new one?"" I'm not normally fumble fingered, but I do have a bad habit of putting my phone in my pocket, and then it falls out. This has happened twice so far. The first time the phone only fell about 2 feet. The 2nd time, it fell about 5 feet. That is what I get for sitting on the railing outside the restaurant.Do I need a new phone? Nope. Do I need a new case? Negative. The Pelican Phone Protector isn't scuffed, scratched, or even dented. Did I mention it fell 5 feet? Onto concrete? I think rugged is an understatement (at least by normal urban living standards.)Installation of the case is a breeze. It snapped on in about 5 seconds. It's not quite as easy to get off, but I don't plan on doing that anytime soon, so I should be ok. That 5 foot fall? The case didn't so much as come apart at an edge. I may need a pry bar to get it off.Overall: 5 Stars. Awesome protection, classic good looks.

"What couldn't I get used to?Audio: Having the chat audio completely separate from the game audio left me trying to multitask between what was going on in the game and what people were saying. It would be nice if you could select for the game audio to come over the bluetooth as well. Maybe a separate volume control?Fit: I'm used to in the ear or over the ear headsets. This one is a strange hybrid. I kept thinking if I moved my head it would fall off.The good:Set up: Pairing with my PS3 was simple and fast. The instructions that came with it did the job well.Style: If you are the type that likes to make things match, you can switch out the faceplates to go with your wardrobe.Overall: 3 stars. This is not a bad headset for the price.

"I have had a ""Love/Hate"" relationship with the Scratch programming language for years. I love it because it is easy to to simple things. I hated it because I never had the time to really dig in. The Super Scratch Programming Adventure! gave me the perfect opportunity to sit back, relax, and give it another shot.First off, don't expect a lot from the story. It is meant for kids. However, it is really cute and provides a nice background to what you are doing. You aren't just learning to program, you are saving the world!I have seen a couple of reviews that say,""The resource CD was missing."" All of the resources are available for download, it says so right in the book. The book even walks you through how to add them to your projects, even ones not in the book!Everything is laid out very simply. You read the story, and then there is a project to do. The story is in comic book format, the project is more ""text-bookish"" but still easy to follow.Now that I am done, I plan to pass this along to my daughter. She is a 5th grader and I know she'd get a kick out of making her own games!Overall: 4 stars.

"I love my Keurig and I don't think I could start my day without it. I am always looking for something new and definitely am not one of those ""I will only drink brand X!"" kind of coffee lovers. So when this became available I decided to give it a shot.It's really great to get a variety of a brand so that you can find out what you like and what you don't. It is always frustrating to buy a box and realize that you really don't like what you bought and are stuck with it (or have to give it away.)Here is what I liked:Maple Sleigh: This one smells wonderful! Think ""cabin in Vermont"". It has a subtle, breakfasty maple flavor.Vanilla Skyline: A little light on flavor, but definitely good.Here is what I didn't like:Fuhgeddaboutit: Way too bitter for my taste.Corner Donut Shop: Tastes like a ""wannabe"" cinnamon blend from another brand.Notable for that that like that type of coffee:French Roast, Breakfast Blend, and Cyclone.Overall: 4 stars.

"I'm picky when it comes to perfumes, so I was delighted to discover that this is exactly what I've been looking for! The scent is clean and classy, avoiding the highly alcohol-y undertone of old lady perfumes and the over-wrought forced brightness of a lot of the perfumes targeted towards younger sets. I love that the scent is feminine and alluring without being blatantly flowery or ""exotic"".I am also thrilled that this perfume is perfect balanced in strength. It's subtle - it won't knock anyone over when you walk into a room or cause grief for people who don't tolerate fragrances well - but still strong enough to be pleasantly noticeable and to last the day. I love it, my husband likes it, and it's balanced enough for daily wear.

"This book should be required reading by anyone and everyone who gives to charity, volunteers with charities, or works with the non-profit, development, municipal management, government or church sectors of life. Lupton succinctly and compassionately lays out the truth about why we as individuals, organizations, and even nations dump trillions of dollars into charity, only to see need continue, grow, or even get worse!From small scale to global scale, Lupton provides examples of what's been tried and why it doesn't work – no matter how well planned or well intended. He also lays out a modest but absolutely on-track set of principles for how to do better moving forward.

"I was very excited to read this, but sadly disappointed for a lot of reasons. In the interests of keeping this concise, I'll just hit the highlights:- Disappointing selection of individuals and case studies featured. A few were great, many were mediocre, and others didn't seem to fit the category of “misfit” at all. Frankly, a few were just plain irritating.- Odd choices of “lessons” to be learned left much to be desired. Example:  “pivot”, which was apparently intended to suggest “transfer existing skills to a new but semi-related arena”, could have been a high-impact lesson, except that the examples didn't properly supported it. Meanwhile, numerous examples did clearly show the value of actively and effectively responding to existing market needs and demands (in a total population or sub-group), but this was never addressed at all.- Skewed moral perspective. I'll be the first to acknowledge that we can learn plenty of good lessons from downright terrible people, and in a couple cases the authors dealt very effectively with morally ambiguous situations like piracy (both 18th century and modern). The “King Tone” section, on the other hand, was terribly skewed. Oh, the FBI continues to show disdain for a criminal organization with a horrifically bloody history who continues to actively sell crack cocaine to youth, despite the fact that the new leader claims to be on higher moral ground? How judgmental and unreasonable of them! Ugh.- No breakdown, tips, or other useful tools for actually applying any of the lessons we can learn from misfits to real life. (Except to make sure you have a support community, though not a peep is ever said about being correspondingly supportive of the people in this essential circle.) Honestly, this should have been the core of the book – what do these lessons mean for us and how can we act on them… and it just wasn't there at all.I second other reviewers' comments that the writing was often flat and unbalanced – some stories that had the potential to be fascinating and useful were glossed over while others went into far too much pointless and boring detail.Bottom Line: Go read Smartcuts and Widgets instead. They're not exactly the same, but far closer to the promise of this book than this work actually was!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYHTBRFYFRQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDXSFHE#wasThisHelpful","R3VYHTBRFYFRQS","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These wipe packages are compact, taking up less space in your bag, drawer, etc. than most brands, which I consider a plus. They also seem to be more durable than many other brands I've tried, for which they get bonus points! The moisture level is right on target - moist enough to get the job done, but not too wet. They're unscented, so there are no fake chemical fragrances to worry about either. I love that the package securely snaps shut, but is designed in such a way that you can still easily pop it open with just one hand.

"I've tried a ton of notebooks in a variety of styles. Although many were close to what I was looking for, none ever quite brought together everything I was looking for - until now. This is officially perfect!The suede-feel cover is amazing. It feels high end when I touch it, and looks so much more professional than the black plastic stuff these notebooks usually have. The narrow-ruled pages give me tons of lines per page on which to write, but are big enough to write comfortably even when you're in a hurry. The top left has a section to title the page, and there's a slash at the top right to note the date - making both easy to find, while utilizing a minimalist approach that doesn't take up any more space than necessary.The best part is how the notes section at the bottom is set up. Titled ""Action Items"" it gives you the perfect spot to track what you need to physically DO (and by when, if appropriate). It's separated from the rest of the page by a single line, giving it simple and graceful distinction from the rest of your notes without calling a ton of attention to itself otherwise. It's also the ideal size - just big enough for a handful of action items. Not so many that you won't be able to get to them all, or that things will get lost but enough to cover everything you should realistically need. The narrow column at the left of the notes section is just wide enough to be extremely flexible. You could use it to number the tasks, but there's also enough space for a status notation (i.e. ""IP"" for in progress, an arrow and initials if it's been delegated, a date to note completion, or a colored dot if you want to coordinate it with a bullet journal).Also exceptionally convenient is the fact that by having all your dates in the top right corner and all your action items neatly collected at the bottom makes finding and referencing your notes incredibly fast and simple. I have already adopted this as my go-to notebook for meetings with clients, and am loving it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M866PXWT4WQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9UVJQC#wasThisHelpful","R3M866PXWT4WQB","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is more purple in shade than it appears on screen, but it's a nice color. The absolute best part about this is how compact it gets when you roll it up! I've had numerous sleeping bags in my life, and this by far rolls and packs the most neatly and into the smallest little round. That counts for a lot when storage space is at a premium!It's also surprisingly squishy. Although this doesn't really give you any extra padding against hard or rocky ground, it still feels extra comfortable somehow, so points for that! I also love that you can squinch it down over and around your head once you're in. It creates a wonderful snuggle factor and (more importantly) keeps the heat in for those of us jealously guarding every little bit we have. It was roomy enough to move around in, while still appropriately snug to keep you warm and not waste space.Although I have not yet tried it at it's promised 20 degree lower limit, I am very pleased with it and expect to give it plenty of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJUFBALXYZM2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA4I40Y#wasThisHelpful","RJUFBALXYZM2I","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this advertised for people who enjoyed Discovery of Witches, and picked it up not realizing it was a sequel and not having read the first book in the series. That definitely hindered my ability to appreciate it. The author does a decent job of giving you critical background, but I clearly was missing a lot of the intended depth and connections by not having read the previous book.The book was well organized and well edited, for which I give the author great credit (and which earned it 4 stars over 3). That said, the primary issue I had with the book was that the whole thing felt uneven. Examples:- Characters were inconsistent. In some places they felt multi-dimensional; in others, the same characters fell flat.- Chapters alternated between doing relatively nothing and then -bam- big fight/event, then back to nothing.There were definitely threads of plot going that I wasn't able to see at all until the last chapter. In retrospect, you could recognize where the author had been trying to demonstrate an idea or situation that hadn't been apparent during the initial reading. I'm not sure if this was a failure of the writing, or simply difficult for me to see because I hadn't read the previous book first.  Several aspects felt under-explored, as if this could easily have been longer and richer but was kept pared back.The book alternates between modern day and the misadventures of Edward Kelley in Venice in the 1500's. Honestly, I didn't enjoy the Edward Kelley chapters much, and didn't see their point at all until the very last chapter of the book.To her credit, the author makes this an entire story. Although it is clearly midway in a series, and needs to be read after the first, it's adventures reach a clear conclusion, which I appreciated in this era of obnoxious cliff hangers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCZG8NNP8UI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140707#wasThisHelpful","R3UCZG8NNP8UI7","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was very well done; the author clearly knows his subject and does an excellent job of bringing into play the relevant research. Everything is well organized, and I was particularly impressed by the care the author took to note when there were limitations to the research that might impact it's viability, even when it supported his case.Each chapter starts with a common classroom scenario to which anyone who has taught a class, seminar, workshop, etc. will be able to relate. The author then deconstructs the situation to examine the underlying assumptions, pedagogy, and other relevant factors. The book looks at things from the perspective of educators, institutions, and students for a well-rounded approach.The only thing I have to say that isn't glowing praise is that I'd have really liked to see the author explore the relationship between learning styles and classroom discussion. The book is based on the understanding that discussion, while important, is only one of the many ways in which to teach and that it can/will/should be paired with a variety of others for greatest learning. Although the author does address the question of introverts vs. extroverts, nothing was really said about auditory vs. kinesthetic vs. visual learners. Certainly many of the suggested options (one-minute papers, tracking key discussion points on the board, post-discussion summaries, etc.) seem to bridge the gap across these learning styles, I'd really have loved to know if there was research or literature on the effects of doing so.That said, however, the book was an excellent resource and I highly recommend it - regardless of whether you work for a college or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WYE9353PRFV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118571355#wasThisHelpful","R2WYE9353PRFV0","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's start with the good here. The cover was pretty, the writing/vocab was simple and user-friendly, and the author had some interesting ideas and points to make. His reminiscences of Christmases past were the highlight of the book.Unfortunately, those good things could not overcome the aspects of this book that just didn't work for me, which can primarily be summarized under two categories: (1) Flow/cohesiveness and (2) Lack of clear relation to Christmas.Let's start with the second issue first: Lack of Relation To Christmas.Several chapters of this book revolved around the stories and experiences of Zaccharius and Elizabeth. Although I grasp how they are connected to the Christmas story in the larger picture, they don't really seem to be particularly connected to it. Using their experiences for so much of the book felt like stretch. Although the rest of the book linked to Mary, the Magi, and the Shepherds - all of whom are directly active in the Christmas story - they provided a jumping-off point rather than a true anchor for their chapters.Which takes us squarely into the other problem I had and the main reason this book got two stars: Flow/cohesiveness. There were a lot of ideas in this book, many of which could really have used more unpacking and contemplation. Although many of the included trains of thought may have been initially inspired by a character or situation in the Christmas story, they had very little to do with each other or with Christmas. I repeatedly found myself flipping back several pages, trying to figure out how I'd gone from point A to point B and why, since they didn't seem to be cleanly related or relevant to what I thought was being discussed.Example: At one point the author talks about choosing responses that make us better rather than bitter in the face of tragedy. His link to the Christmas story is that getting pregnant with an immaculate child qualified as a tragedy in Mary's world based on the potential impacts and the time period in which she lived. I could see where he was going with the idea, but it never quite actually worked.I think the book would have worked significantly better in a different format. For example, presented as a series of sermons, essays or blog posts loosely tied together under the heading of ""thoughts, reflections, and lessons inspired by reflections on the Christmas story"". Better unpacked and standing alone, the legitimately interesting and worthwhile ideas at the core of the book would have been much more accessible and had more impact. As it was, I felt the book came off as lacking in cohesion and a bit too much of a stretch.Bottom Line: If you're looking for a different way to approach or glean wisdom from the Christmas story, you might find some decent angles here to play with and pursue. If you're looking for a clearly Christmas-related book to enjoy and reflect on as we approach the holiday season, pass on this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PE7B45GZRA00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881295#wasThisHelpful","R3PE7B45GZRA00","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This apron has worked out really well. It is thicker than the old battered one I've been using for years, which is great because I feel like it offers more protection when working with very wet projects (i.e. canning). It sits high enough on top to properly protect your clothes, but not so high that it impedes function or comfort. The adjustable neckline is easy to set up and generally stays in place well.Although I have not decorated mine, both the fabric and the design would lend themselves well to a variety of embellishments.This has been a great choice so far and, given how durable it is, I fully expect to get many years of hard use out of it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GMI97K2US40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8IT946#wasThisHelpful","R37GMI97K2US40","A2NML53YCHS80S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NML53YCHS80S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although this book is a spin off from the Harmless series you will not be lost.  Emma's brother Sean was in that series and their situation was mentioned and explained.  Emma is a genius, simply put.  Her mind works like a computer which is wonderful for assisting this task force but puts her in the socially awkward category.  Del, the leader of this task force, has always had an instant connection with her.  The whole team is working on a serial killer case with very tense moments and great sleuthing.  What I enjoy about Schroeder's writing is her ability to successfully integrate an interesting crime with enough details to keep us guessing and give us romance.  Lots of great characters with plenty of clues to more in the TFH series, most looking forward to Graeme and Elle.  Thank you Melissa for my copy to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENSLUZ48VXBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AADGDM#wasThisHelpful","R3ENSLUZ48VXBV","AICEEONZRFNJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AICEEONZRFNJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pleasantly funny and exciting this was my first Jennifer Crusie book.  Trudy is caught in the craziness of Christmas Eve in the worst toy store ever.  She's trying to find a specific gift for her nephew when she runs into two men she knows from work.  This toy turns out to be more than just a simple toy.  Filled with fun flirting, comical jabs and a dangerous nail file this was a fun short story perfect for a holiday read.

"If I could give this book a higher rating I would. It. Was. Fantastic.  I fell in love with Hollie and Ryan in their first book, Must Love Otters.  This sequel has actually out done the previous.  I laughed, giggled, cried (mostly happy tears) and snorted more than for any other story.  Hollie just can't catch a break, she was almost upstaged by Lucy (a name you will never forget) and a demonic goat (believe me you will despise this goat).  Hollie's love of otters hit close to home for me, literally.  I live near Monterey and always find it comforting when I can relate to the character in more ways than one.  Although this story carries fine on it's own you really need to read them in order, the references will make more sense.  This is a couple that has great chemistry and many secondary characters that could easily carry a story for a dozen books.  I hope to read more about the Fieldings.

"Enjoyed this short story as part of the Shiver anthology but the second time was better.  College romance set in Salem during Halloween between a skeptic and a loner.

"A truly captivating love triangle, sometimes square, for  this magical Elven story.  Perfect for any age group, a sweet and inspiring young love story.  This series has been exciting to read and must be read from the beginning.  The novella, Sway, is an insight into Vancia's life - a great addition to the series.  The author keeps you on your toes guessing who Ryann chooses and how the ""big"" plan goes down.  These teenagers are making very adult decisions about the future of their people yet get to behave like the kids they are.  The innocence in their actions mixed with the seriousness of their endeavor makes the story intriguing.  The creativity behind the Light and Dark Elves is beautiful.  Her storyline involves the power of addiction (not drugs), the influence of technology and the magical Saol water.  The theme touches on many current topics and events, while having a little fun with pop culture (a few movie references might make you giggle).  I needed to read a fun and powerful story, this was it.

"The first story continues with Willie's Aunt Alana, we met her at a party for her son.  She finds herself after the death of her husband.  The story was relatable and heart warming however it lacked an editor.  Simple mistakes like missing words, extra commas, and wrongly used semi colons.  Sort of throws off the flow.The second story is about Caroline Lang, mother to Nate and Noel from the first two stories.  We get to know her life before William, past relationships and a terrible childhood shaped her into the strong woman she is today.  I really enjoyed learning about this strong yet subdued woman.  We finally get an end to the Jessica saga, however I feel the story was slightly long winded.  After all the years Caroline has known William it was never discussed if he learned to sign, she seems to speak a lot with him and that means tremendous amounts of lip reading.  If he loved her I feel it should have been mentioned whether he made the effort to learn or not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDH9AFEZHT6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBU31EO#wasThisHelpful","RHDH9AFEZHT6P","AICEEONZRFNJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AICEEONZRFNJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Out of the park!  Baseball players seem to have a bad reputation, girls in every city and a party hard attitude.  Despite those crazy tabloid rumors there are men that carry a torch for their women and have respectable lives.  Gavin, an injured player traded down to rehab an injury and is dating a beautiful model, fits that typical baseball player stereotype.  But unlike the usual baseball guy he has respect, adoration and is quite charming for his new love.  He realizes the move to Jersey was a good thing and allowed him to see his girlfriend for the fake she is and find out what it feels to love.  Jessica, the physical therapist to the Sonics, has a tough tomboy attitude.  Growing up with 6 brothers all in pro sports hardened her attitude toward other athletes, plus a terrible ex-boyfriend didn't help either.  Jess and Gavin have this electric spark that can't help but ignite.  Their relationship is playful and true but aggressive too.  They seem to fit together naturally and it's really adorable listening to their banter.  This is the third book with the Sonics.  While it's a standalone story it helps to read the others as the characters interact and reappear.

"Extremely funny and randomly suspenseful, this is one of my new favorite books.  May Wexler, a freelance photographer, receives a text directing her to a seedy biker bar.  Assuming it is her sister she goes unknowingly getting involved in a situation.  Ozzie comes to the rescue in more ways than one.  From the bar and her boring job, May is saved by this hot military type stud.  You always hear actors say never be in a film with kids or animals and now I understand why.  Felix and Sahara, two of the most opposite of animals, are great comic relief.  May's nieces and nephew are a riot with a fantastic bathroom scene full of innocent mischief.  Ozzie's crew is a great set of people with interesting personalities that keep things hopping.  Thankfully this is the first in a new series and we can enjoy more of this motley crew.

"A powerful and loving series!  Maria and Thom are developing into a full fledged relationship.  Maria is experiencing new feelings and thinking about the future.  Thom is battling his ex-wife, Rachel, while she battles her own demons.  While we don't get answers to Rachel's craziness, yet, I assume she's on drugs or experiencing emotional backlash from her own childhood.  She is definitely off balance and her daughter, Emily, acts much more mature than her mother.  Really enjoyed reading the alternating perspectives from Maria, Thom and Emily.  If all men were like Thom we'd be much happier women.

"Johnson's firefighter series was fabulous and I hope this new one can  be just as good.  As a prequel we get a short look at Link's priviledged life and military career.  A rich brat given anything he wants, never held accountable, and the girls love him.  One last straw and the judge gives him choice prison or military.  Lucky for him Link chose the Army.  We get to see him grow up in about eleven chapters.  It's a quick read with an underlying romance, Mattie from high school, and an exciting moment near the end proving Link to be a courageous soldier.

"Wonderful book with two novellas about strong women, both physically and mentally.  The first woman is an undercover detective with an edge, one that gets her suspended.  Keeping with the Scottish theme she is cousins to Jenna from Just a Little Kilted and falls for a firefighter/paramedic with Scottish and Italian ancestory.  The second continues the other story from Just a Little Kilted, from Noel's perspective.  We get more background about her and what she and Rick are doing for Nate and Zoe.  It's sort of in tandem with Nate and Zoe's story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZF3F6VQFKD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBS3A1U#wasThisHelpful","R8ZF3F6VQFKD1","AICEEONZRFNJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AICEEONZRFNJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Superman is weak compared to Slade.  This guy throws himself in harms way any chance he gets.  Trouble magnet for sure and a softy to boot.  Britton, pronounced like Britain, had a twin sister, Perris.  She died and Brit can't get over the guilt she feels so she needs to talk to Perris' boyfriend.  Slade and Britton bond over the long roadtrip to find out some answers.  Slade has deep emotions kept close to his heart and only Brit brings them out.

"My first Sidney Halston book and I choose the fourth one in a series.  Luckily it didn't matter because this was a standalone with a new couple.  Cain is retired military and a professional fighter.  Violet is a nurse, her fiance died in battle and the three of them were best friends.  Talk about an awkward friendship, two guys and girl since they were babes but the guys go off to join the military leaving said girl behind.  Unknowing to the girl both of them loved her, in their own messed up way and never expressed it.  Despite Cain's messed up communication skills he has a deep appreciation and love for Violet.  Her whole life she's battled self esteem issues concerning her weight and Cain makes sure she forgets it all.  Even though he's a fighter the amount of violence and cage fighting scenes were pretty minimal.  If you like the caveman type, you know the kind that grunt and demand, Cain is perfect for you.  This novel had everything from hot sex, sassy comments, humor and suspense.  I loved it all and hope to read JL's story real soon.

"My mind is going crazy with clues and trying to piece it all together.  The first 40%, or so, we are getting inside the mind of Ashley trying to find her kidnapper/rapist/murderer.  It's a sick and twisted mind ride full of clues.  The rest is Jane and her team solving the most twisted and psychotic case ever imaginable.  Brown does a phenomenal job of inserting clues along the way that only make sense near the end.  The entire time you need to just read and enjoy the way she conducts her investigation and let the story capture you.  Although this is part of a trilogy you could probably dive into this without reading the first but I believe you would be a little lost.  The first book sets the stage and the history of the characters is extremely important in this second book.  I highly recommend reading Blood and Bone and immediately follow with Sin and Swoon.

"If you want an absorbing, coming of age story, told in an alternating stream of consciousness and flashback form, then you will enjoy this debut novel by Jan Ellison.Although the writing is very good in most parts, the pace of the story frustrated me. I actually skimmed the end of the book to relieve the tension and then returned to read the novel in its entirety. I’m not sure I have ever done that before. However, it made the reading of the story far more enjoyable, and I could better appreciate the quality of Ellison’s literary style.Annie Black, the main character, and through whose eyes we view “reality,” spent a year in London as a young unmarried secretary. She fought feelings of attraction to several men through binges with alcohol and more than “small” indiscretions. These events appear as flashbacks, contained within her description of her current life, now full of sadness and anguish. Her decades of a solid marriage, family life and career as a lighting designer all crumble after her son, Robbie, lies in the hospital following a harrowing car accident. Past and present blend as she searches her soul to find the “shadows” that have emerged from childhood, early adulthood and being a wife and mother.Ellison provides a deep, insightful look into the mind of her main character-narrator. She develops her characters well and adds an air of mystery. I found “A Slight Indiscretion” to hold elements of forgiveness and redemption. These attributes carry the novel, and cause me to recommend it, despite frequent agonizingly slow paces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RN87SPBUNNQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995449#wasThisHelpful","R2RN87SPBUNNQA","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Take one talented, 19 year old black woman college student; add an international crisis,  world leaders trying to save face, yet prevent nuclear destruction, and you have the makings of an interesting, if not believable, novel of intrigue and suspense. Stephen Carter unfolds a story in Back Channel that makes the reader wonder how much could be veiled accounts of what really happened in October 1962.Margo Jensen demonstrates her excellent mind in her Conflict Theory class at Cornell University. Her professor hand picks her to participate in a special mission that sends her to Bulgaria. Based on her performance there, she suddenly finds herself becoming the “back channel” for unofficial negotiations to parallel the official negotiations during the Cuban Missile Crisis. This leads her into seemingly clandestine meetings with President John Kennedy and puts her life on the line to receive and pass information behind the scenes.Although the book presents a number of involved and dangerous escapades, I found reading it became laborious and drawn out in places. Having lived through this period of history, the plot seems to drag on compared to the real series of events. The author takes time out of the ongoing story to fill in past events, characters and subplots. The interruptions to the twists and turns never seem to end.The book creates a realistic backdrop of Washington, D.C., the White House and  dialogue among key political and military figures. Most of the characters seem realistic enough.It made for an interesting read, but certainly is more fiction than historical.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2922TQCXP2EZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385349602#wasThisHelpful","R2922TQCXP2EZD","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Answer to Bad Religion is Not No Religion delivers a great synopsis of the differences between Christian religions that do not practice and those that do embody the teachings of Christianity. The first are toxic religions which breed judgmental and destructive thinking. The second model provides practical, loving ways to live out an authentic faith. He advises not to give up on religion. History has proven one can’t stamp out faith. There is hope.Thielen uses a straight forward manner. He interweaves stories and examples with Biblical quotations to support his ideas. The concepts are easy to grasp and demonstrate the strength of the Gospel through living it in church communities and individual lives. He clearly points out how narrow minded, reactive thinking cripples the true expression of Jesus’ teachings and the guidelines that more mainstream and moderate religions follow..Fundamentalists will probably not buy into Thielen’s theories. Those seeking relief from the legalistic, judgmental religions will find standards by which to determine how other faiths can meet their needs.I highly recommend this book to those “turned off” by religion and by those who want to make their religious congregations even stronger and more vibrant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6KLUORBJSEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664239471#wasThisHelpful","R1B6KLUORBJSEE","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever had a bad day? Cara Kryzik has a string of them. She awakens to one of a series of crises in Mary Kay Andrews’ latest, “Save the Date”.  A talented, but struggling florist who is trying to make it on her own, Cara meets one challenge after another, some of them comedic, but many of them threatening her livelihood.Will her talents be recognized by the clique of snobbish, aristocratic circles who dominate the southern city where she lives?  Will Cara survive the many crises that continue to pile up despite her sincere efforts to make a success of her business? Will Cara let pride prevent her from being a successful businesswoman and find love?These are some of the questions Andrews creates for the reader. Interesting characters and quick dialogue offset the wordy descriptions that slow down the momentum of the book. The author demonstrates her knowledge of flowers and arrangements with accurate and exact descriptions of Cara’s creations.Humor comes from Cara’s pet dog, Poppy, and Jack Finnerty’s, Shaz. Through a strange mix-up, both owners become acquainted. The friendship is very rocky at first, but builds as the storyline progresses. Cara’s extremely efficient and helpful assistant, Bert, adds color to the novel. He and Cara even wager how long the marriages of their bridal clients will last. They see the brides’ emotions run rampant, mothers of the brides who interfere and make decisions for their daughters, and controlissues that prevail.Lots of characters and subplots weave through the story: uncaring landlords, reactions of Cara’s father (a demanding retired Air Force Colonel), a stolen heirloom Cara used for one of the weddings, Jack’s relationship with a former girlfriend, Cara’s ex-husband, a new competitor florist who tries to sabotage Cara’s successes. Each one creates a crisis that leads to further crises.Although an unnecessarily lengthy novel, I found the book to be an interesting and sometimes quite humorous read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GILMOEIEZOUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250019699#wasThisHelpful","R3GILMOEIEZOUF","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark shadows sweep over normally spunky red-haired Maggie Hope in The Prime Minister’s Secret Agent.  Maggie is now an instructor at the British training center in Arisaig, Scotland.  Her past experiences continue to haunt her and create a “black dog” (as she’s names it). She has become depressed, speaks sharply to the trainees, and searches for stability and direction. Maggie admits she’s become a professional and “no more the plucky ingenue.”  To serve as a “stand alone” read, the author cleverly weaves in prior characters and incidents that have affected the heroine to catch the reader up with the fourth book of the Maggie Hope Mystery series.On orders to take R & R, Maggie goes to Edinburgh to see her friend Sarah, a professional ballerina. This leads Maggie into a baffling murder investigation. Floriography (language of flowers) helps her discover the British secret plan to develop biological weapons to continue their war efforts. As she probes the mysterious deaths and helps her friend recover from being poisoned, her depression begins to fade and she slowly regains her confidence as an agent.Meanwhile, two other subplots emerge:Errors and obstacles in communication lead to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The author’s meticulous research techniques are apparent in the exchanges among the diplomats, Army and Navy officers and staff of the U.S., Japan and Great Britain.Maggie’s mother, Clara Hess, awaits execution in England for being a Nazi spy. A doctor recognizes the possibility Clara may have multiple personalities.Although I enjoyed the book, it didn’t read as evenly as the other three novels. The storyline does pose some questions: How ethical is the use of biological warfare?  How is Maggie affected by allegiances to two countries?  Will she and former boyfriend, Hugh Thompson, reconcile? The book provides a transition for Maggie to de-program from her harrowing stint in Berlin to her next upcoming adventure - to accompany the Prime Minister to the United States. I look forward to the next installment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N1UNRPEECF6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345536746#wasThisHelpful","R2N1UNRPEECF6Z","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
".What great memories this CD brings back in the fresh and upbeat style of Ray Conniff.  The re-recording is crisp and clear.  The album features the orchestra with the chorus in the background.

"This truffle combination is quite good and smooth. I received good comments when I offered them to guests. The smooth chocolate and tasty caramel flavors, however, are so blended, that it’s hard to distinguish them. The “center” of caramel isn’t distinct as I’ve tasted in other Lindt Lindor offerings.

"The fact the Taylor 5863 Timer/Clock is water and impact resistant made it an appealing product to order. It also appeared to be a good substitute for my travel alarm which doesn't provide good accuracy anymore. When it arrived, I found it to be larger than I anticipated for travel, but still a compact, smart looking device.Having to find a special tiny screwdriver to open the battery case was my first obstacle. At least the batteries were provided. After that hurdle, it became a challenge to read the directions and start the digital clock. I decided to wait until later to turn on the timer.However, without my knowledge, the timer had somehow been set and hours later sounded a loud, disconcerting noise at an inconvenient time.I read the instructions again and thought I got the gist of it, but it's not all that easy and efficient. One has to press the volume button to change from clock to timer. That can alter the sound of the alarm to very loud to not ringing at all.  Frankly, over repeated uses, I've found the timer to be a nuisance, rather than a help. The light button lasts for a momentary time and makes the same jolting ""beep"" noise when pushed.About the only redeeming qualities are the large, easy to read numbers on the digital clock and the handy pull out easel, which allows the clock to sit nicely on a tabletop. I don't foresee using it much as a timer due to the difficulty of setting it, changing it to the clock mode and the annoying alarm sound. This device was a big disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S9LZ19HS28XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00876CQ8S#wasThisHelpful","R1S9LZ19HS28XW","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American Saint: The Life of Elizabeth Setonby Joan BarthelElizabeth Ann Bayley Seton “had it all” and “lost it all” by ordinary standards. By ecclesiastical standards, she gained it all, becoming the first American-born Saint to be recognized by the Roman Catholic Church.  Born into aristocracy just prior to the Revolutionary War, she braved illness, deaths of her husband and two of her five children, disapproval of her family to become a convert to the Catholic faith and weathered many challenges to follow her heart and God’s will as she saw it.Raised a Protestant, she married wealthy Will Seton and had five children. She had barely weaned her baby daughter when she and Will embarked on a trip to Italy, hoping the favorable climate would enable his health to improve. He died of tuberculosis and left Elizabeth a widow with five children at the age of 29. Her experience in Italy exposed her to the Catholic faith through the Filicchi family who assisted her after Will’s death. Following her return to America, her interest in the church led her to convert to Roman Catholicism, much to the disdain of her family. Catholicism was not recognized in her home state of New York.Elizabeth gave up the wealth she had known and moved with her children to Maryland, a haven for Catholics. Under the American Bishop, John Carroll, Elizabeth began her work as a teacher. When she was sent to the remote area of Emmitsburg, MD, she established the first order of active nuns in the United States. Her faith, prayer life, dedication and abilities to supervise children’s education, despite severe health and rudimentary conditions, became pivotal in founding American parochial education.She became the first American-born saint named by the Roman Catholic Church on September 14, 1975.Barthal describes Elizabeth’s spirituality through her writings, prayer life, quotations from letters to  friends and family to exemplify why she was considered a saint. “She had been a Protestant, a Catholic, rich, poor, an aristocrat, an outcast, a wife, a mother (working mother), a widow, a teacher, a social worker, a nurse and the founder of the first order of active women religious in U.S.” all in 46 years.An engaging book, I found parts of it to detour the reader from a chronological flow of Elizabeth’s life. Albeit interesting details, a couple of the early chapters became confusing, almost going into a stream of consciousness that detracted from showcasing Elizabeth in the historical framework. Barthal makes clearer Elizabeth’s later progress in establishing a school, standing up against authoritarian clergy and securing her place in American Catholic history. For a serious reader who wants to learn more about St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, I recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3163PAPEBNLB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312571623#wasThisHelpful","R3163PAPEBNLB2","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very interesting and different plot drives A Circle of Wives and makes for an absorbing read. When prominent cosmetic surgeon Dr. John Taylor is found dead in a hotel room, no one initially can imagine the intriguing and shocking details that will emerge. Upon investigation, the police discover his death actually to be a murder. Then the plot really thickens.Who would murder this highly successful and admired plastic surgeon? What would the motive be? Who would benefit from his death? And...how in the world did this distinguished doctor live a secret life that included three wives?These are among the many questions that confront young investigator, Samantha Adams who sets out to unravel the startling and complicated case. Answers only lead to more questions and more suspectsLaPlante writes each chapter from a separate individual’s perspective. At first, this is a bit confusing, with the chapters alternating among the characters. Eventually it becomes easier to differentiate the characters and reveals the story in a very creative way.  In addition to Samantha, we have the three wives: Deborah, the declared wife of over 25 years; MJ  who finds her life shattered at the kitchen table while reading the obituary; and Helen, the self-composed, compassionate pediatric oncologist, and newest wife. Somehow, none of them know about each other.

"What a smooth and soothing voice Perry Como had.  This is one of the best Christmas albums I have. All the songs feature his signature style and are great even as background music. His voice has a calming effect and provides a gentler rendition of some of the old familiar songs.I especially like the title song, ""I Wish It Could Be Christmas Forever.""  I don't really remember it being popular, but when I heard it recently on the TV music station, I decided to track it down.

"The Ray Conniff singers had a very distinctive style and it is a thrill to listen to them again in this collection of Christmas music. With an upbeat rhythm, they bring back memories of many a Christmas of the past.

"When entertaining, I need more than the traditional 6 mugs I normally have on my counter. I thought the Francois et Mimi Stainless Steel Coffee Mug Tree Holder would add accessibility to more mugs. I was very disappointed to find it will hold only 4 of my mugs (11"" in circumference). The 3"" space between the lower rung and the base is insufficient to accommodate 6. The advertised capacity states, “Holds 4-6 Mugs, Depending on Size.”  It would have to be a demitasse or espresso-sized mug to fit, if that. Neither of these are what I use to serve warm beverages to my guests.In it’s favor, the mug tree is very sturdy, has a non-skid, textured base and looks attractive enough. The “arms” are straight, with small knobs at the end to keep mugs from falling off. I would prefer more of a “hook” to secure the mugs.This mug tree does not fare favorably with another one I got recently.

"Vatican Waltzby Roland MerulloWhat would you do if you had “visions” and spiritual experiences you couldn’t explain? How could you find someone who would believe you? What if God was telling you to strike new ground and defy ancient traditions and practices?These questions challenge Cynthia Piantedosi as she grows up in the Roman Catholic Church in a small town in Massachusetts. She develops a very deep spiritual life. She seeks advice from the local parish priest who becomes a mentor and guides her until his untimely death.While Cynthia pursues her education in nursing school, her visions continue and include seeing herself as a female priest. Although the local archbishop recognizes her as a deeply spiritual and honest woman, he gives Cynthia little, if any hope the Church will change. He suggests she go to Rome to talk to a cardinal friend of his. Cynthia flies to Rome, meets with the cardinal who says her request to become a priest at this time is impossible. He dismisses her with a warning to be very careful in trying to pursue her vision any further; there may be people out there who would want to do her harm. This veiled warning begins a series of mysterious events that lead to a surprise ending.The author gives excellent insight into the character’s search for truth and a deeper spirituality amid the doctrines of the Church. One can understand her frustration between what she believes to be God’s call and the rigid exclusion of women in the role of priests. The mystery surrounding her first mentor’s death and her adventures in Italy provide interesting reading and speculation. The book is contemporary as it addresses other themes and quotes spiritual writers who foreshadow some of the recent emphasis on social justice made by Pope Francis.My only disappointment is the dramatic twist at the end.  Not to be a spoiler, but the plot did not support the conclusion. It seems to stand alone. I do recommend the book, however.

"Mr. Lynch's Holiday  traces the on-going development of the relationship between a father and son who are both in transitional phases of their lives. Irish born Dermot lives in England and has recently experienced the death of his wife. He leaves Birmingham, England for a spontaneous holiday to visit his only son, Eamonn, in Spain.  Eamonn had emigrated there with Laura, the love of his life. They have become part of the housing area of Lomaverde, a community of expats who experience the decline of the once lovely setting.Both Dermot and Eamonn have unresolved emotions. They don't know each other really well at all. During Dermot's surprise visit, they become acquainted.  Dermot realizes his son's anguish over the abrupt departure of Laura, and Eamonn sees his father's discomfort in his new life as a widower.  Eamonn is ashamed of his own behavior, and doesn't seem to know how to handle his depressive reactions. Dermot is bewildered as to how to help him.  Both see faults in each other and have to come to grips with ""making conversation over nothing at all."" Some of these awkward moments give each insight into the other as they struggle with their relationship.O'Flynn introduces some interesting characters, expats, Inga, Cheryl and Roger, Becca and Ian, to name a few. She adds humor to the story as she describes them,the situations they encounter and interactions with Dermot and Eamonn. There's even a bit of intrigue as the residents of Lomaverde confront and potential vandals in the area.The author uses alternating flashbacks to flesh out the background of father and son and bring the two main characters up to the present. I felt this technique tended to confuse the fluidity and continuity of story. Despite this negative, I recommend the book as an entertaining and thoughtful read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109HZKX70X7NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091815#wasThisHelpful","R109HZKX70X7NJ","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've since found it easier to store each separately in other CD cases I have on hand.Roger Williams was a versatile, talented and classic artist. I had the opportunity to hear him live in concert and it was a treat. So glad to be able to have these renditions of some of his greatest hits....great memories and music. I recommend this collection of his works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNMFL4CJRN0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CZTG0O#wasThisHelpful","R2NNMFL4CJRN0Q","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many of these songs were from my parents' younger days and I grew up hearing them played and sung in our home. What a treat to have them in disk form and be able to enjoy them at home or in the car. Most are peppy and upbeat and create a pleasurable atomsphere. Frank Pourcel created a special sound that captures the imagination. I'm very pleased I was able to get these for my collection.

"""No soldier dreams of coming home to an empty house."" This is precisely what Dr. Mike Scanlon, orthopedist/podiatrist/soldier, does when he returns home on emergency leave from duty in Afghanistan. His wife Chole has died of a knife wound under questionable circumstances. Her sister Danielle and husband Bob have already begun to care for  Emily, Mike and Chole's infant daughter.Mike is troubled as he learns more about Chloe's death. He tries to relate to his baby daughter who doesn't recognize him and screams anytime he comes near her.  He hardly has time to go through the motions of the funeral before he has to report back to active duty. While in Afghanistan, he faces more brutality of war. The author does a credible job describing the events and emotions of what a soldier faces. As one of the characters summarizes, ""Good people can't imagine evil. It catches us by surprise, and it always will.""This phrase continues to haunt Mike as he returns home, injured, after serving the remainder of his tour. He relies on medicine to kill the pain and begins an effort to discover the truth behind his wife's death. Was it possibly not an accident? Is the murder of one of her best friends linked to Chloe's untimely death? Will he ever be able to relate to his little girl? Will he be able to return to being a surgeon?  Mike puts his professional and personal life at risk as he struggles to answer these questions.Don't Go is a story of war and its effects on both those who serve and those who remain at home. It's a story of a dedicated husband and father who sees his world turn upside down and challenge his integrity, strength, relationships and ability to love. He states, ""War changes everything, and everybody.""Although some of the personal incidents of Mike's life may be definite fiction, the story presents a contemporary view of the emotional scars our citizen soldiers and their families have had to endure in the past 12 years. I highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RV6NXEQNEP4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250010071#wasThisHelpful","R1RV6NXEQNEP4G","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She's forced to kill in self defense and then literally runs for her life. She feels she's so far out of her realm, she doesn't know where to begin to clear herself or convince the authorities of the truth.Meanwhile, Lauritzia Velez, nanny to the Bachman children, runs and then hides to protect herself and the Bachman family from possible harm. A Mexican national, Lauritzia has known tragedy as she has lost several family members to the drug wars in her native land. Her hopes to reconstruct her life in a new country dissolve.How are these two women's lives entwined?  How do the tragic and wrongful deaths several years ago of University of Denver students vacationing in Mexico tie in with current events?  Will Lauirtzia and Wendy be able to find safety and reveal the truth to officials?The author keeps the reader guessing and waiting for the next turn of events throughout the novel. The plot, though a bit contrived, helps to expose the story of the Mexican drug wars and how decisions of the U.S. government inflamed the situation.I enjoyed the rapid pace of the action and the countless ways the characters devised to save themselves when there seemed ""no way back.""

"His Majesty's HopeSusan Elia MacNealIn His Majesty's Hope, Maggie Hope, our spunky, energetic and dedicated copper- headed young spy from Susan MacNeal's former novels, finds herself in a completely new assignment. This time she will become England's first woman spy to enter Nazi Germany. With a new identity and background, Maggie parachutes into Germany only to find herself willing to extend her time and possibly endanger her life for the sake of her country.MacNeal has done extensive research and reveals the awful truth about the Nazi's heinous plan - Operation Compassionate Death. This program exterminates ""unsuitable"" people, particularly handicapped, sick children, or kinder-Euthanaise. The novel exposes a horrifying insight into the realities of war and the effects on innocent children through the eyes of both onlooker, Elise Hess, a nurse at a German hospital, and Maggie, whose life eventually intertwines with Elise's.The reader gets an early indication the characters will be drawn together, yet it is of interest to learn how the author achieves this. What will happen when Maggie's life crosses with Clara Hess, Maggie's birth mother, who was formerly presumed dead and now works for the Nazi's? How can Maggie help Elise's efforts to lead a Jewish friend and a mysterious hospital patient to safety?As in the previous novels, Maggie continues to unwittingly involve herself with twists and plots that leave the reader wondering how she will manage to get out of this last hot spot.

"The Ambassador's Daughterby Pam JenoffAn intelligent and outspoken young woman, Margot Rosenthal, accompanies her father, Friedrich Rosenthal, to Paris where he is to serve as an advisor at the Versailles Peace Treaty meetings post World War I.During the war, Margot lived with her father, a scholar and academic,  while he taught at Oxford. She finds herself now in a strange city and somewhat bored with little to do. Originally from Berlin, she has used Paris to distance herself from her fiancé, Stefan, as he recovers from disabling injuries incurred in the war. It's difficult for her to face the reality of the impending marriage when so many things in her life have changed.Margot meets a woman musician, Krysia Smok, who befriends her and introduces Margot to some liberal thinking colleagues. Unwittingly, Margot involves herself with an espionage situation and finds it difficult to unweave the web she has created. She also finds herself attracted to a German naval officer, Georg, who invites her to work for him as a translator.She questions loyalties to all those whom she trusts and who trust her. How can Margot be true to her father, Georg and Stefan? Can she betray the trust of Georg?  Can she admit her feelings have lessened for Stefan?How does she confront secrets her father has withheld? Can she be true to herself?With historical events as backdrops, Jenoff examines the discrimination between the French hosts and the German delegation.  We see events and challenges of that time from the viewpoint of young Margot. Jenoff uses stream of consciousness well to enter into the heroine's thoughts and deepest emotions. Often she includes this technique in the same paragraph as the dialogue and causes the reader to confuse what is being said with what the character thinks.I've read several of Jenoff's books and enjoyed them. This one proves to be another interesting read. I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVULVHYSCVOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778315096#wasThisHelpful","R3GVULVHYSCVOZ","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

".Just as Maggie Hope prepares to become a spy for MI-5 behind enemy lines in Germany, she learns she will stay in England instead. She's assigned to tutor the young Princess Elizabeth in mathematics at Windsor Castle. British security have moved Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret to this location to protect the future monarch and her sister from German air raids in London. In reality, Maggie is on secret mission to discover who is sending messages to the Germans from Windsor Castle.The murders of two women, one a lady-in-waiting, seem unrelated until Maggie begins to learn more information about each. Who was responsible for their deaths? How do the persons living in the castle play a part in the plot?  Who is the person getting messages to the Germans?  How will these events and characters impact the safety of the Princess?  How can Maggie protect her?  Is her own life in danger?Princess Elizabeth's Spy is the second in the Maggie Hope Mystery series. In the first novel, Mr. Churchill's Secretary, Maggie appears as a sprite, intelligent, driven and quick witted individual who is highly skilled in mathematics and code breaking. She continues to fulfill the image as she moves through her new experiences. Since she has felt the betrayal of many people before, she isn't sure whom to trust and has to ""take care not to let feelings trump logic"" as she begins to acquaint herself with the personnel at the castle.Other threads of the story include Maggie's new found unsettling relationship with her father, the disappearance of her military boyfriend over German territory, and her growing feelings for other co-workers. A complex character, Maggie finds her attempts  to separate her personal life from her job as a spy sometimes very challenging. .To develop a historical mood as a backdrop for the intrigue, MacNeal describes vintage music playing in the background, what kind of food is being served and activities going on to support the war efforts. She describes the castle's floor plan and surroundings and the lifestyle of the residents with authenticity. Anecdotal conversations between the future queen and her sister add a special quality to the story. The two princesses rehearse and perform a play for their parents, the King and Queen of England, and Prime Minister Churchill during his Christmas visit to the royal family.While Maggie's efforts to save the Princess are a bit unrealistic, a suspenseful pursuit of kidnappers and potential traitors ensues.  Maggie ends her assignment as Princess Elizabeth's tutor and prepares for her next adventure of intrigue.I enjoyed this mystery even more than the first and look forward to reading the  forthcoming  Maggie Hope Mystery, Hitler's Nightingale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPWKG3COZH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553593625#wasThisHelpful","R3PPWKG3COZH7","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

".The opening sentence, ""The President is...dead."" sets a rapid pace for the new political intrigue novel, I Do Solemnly Swear, by D.M. Annechino.As Katherine ""Kate"" Ann Miles becomes President of the United States, she immediately faces a major international crisis. At the same time, her personal life begins to disintegrate and she feels her life is in danger. Whom can she trust?  How strong are her instincts to guide the nation into a potential conflict? What force is threatening her presidency and the nation? Even former first Lady, Elizabeth Rodgers, warns Kate to be careful, as her life may be endangered like her late husband's.Excellent descriptive phrases, sometimes pithy analogies and comments illustrate the perspective of the main players to set the background for the political intrigue. A list of characters at the front of the book clarifies the positions of people Kate has to interact with as President.The engrossing story is haunting and sometimes chilling as Annechino presents fictional scenarios that possibly have overtones of truth in them. Descriptions of independent acts of violence are so explicit they often distract from the major storyline, however. The sinister plot weaves a web of intrigue and mystery and leaves the reader to wonder if Kate has defeated all her enemies. How will she continue to carry out her presidency?

".I remember in American History class in school, the first thing we studied was the explorers and conquistadors. We focused upon how they came from Europe and ""opened"" the ""new"" world. We thought of them as heroes. The peoples that already lived here, Native Americans, were mentioned, but mostly as some odd savages available to be civilized. The Native American reaction to having their land taken was seldom given any emphasis - - except the occasional Cowboy vs Indian battle / skirmish.Coming of the Storm is historical fiction written by archeologists. I like novels that tell a story while revealing information about a culture and people that appear different from my own culture.  This novel is an excellent example of this.  Although this book is about Spanish conquistadors, the focus switches from the heroic invaders to the courageous indigenous people fighting to save their land and culture.Set in Florida, among the many tribes of native people the story uses two fictional characters, Black Shell and Pearl Hand, to narrate the tale of a growing revolt against the forces of Spain.  With Pearl Hand as his partner, Black Shell must discover how to unite the separate tribes of his native land and defeat the soulless armies of Hernando de Soto. The book provides an excellent revelation of native culture - religion, holy practices and rituals as well as wars against and among the tribes.The authors do a superior job picturing the tactics of the Spanish forces. They include very detailed descriptions of the weapons and how they were used. Details are so  exquisite and one can understand how natives could not defeat the Kristianos, even  with 10 to 1 odds. The Spanish  are trying to subdue or eliminate indigenous people who infest land they consider their own.  After all, they claim the Pope gave this land to the Spaniards.This is an engrossing  book and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35CMKON276ZX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439153884#wasThisHelpful","R35CMKON276ZX6","A35V32HZEGZH04","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35V32HZEGZH04?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Chloe is suddenly expelled from school and is being harassed by the local police.  How could this have happened?My initial expectation was that this story would focus on Chloe's problem.  Why was she expelled?  Was she actually guilty of a crime?  How could she have been in the wrong place?  Who could do this to her?  In Between Days however, emphasizes relationships.  This is a character driven novel.  The plot has multiple storylines, but is predictable.  The characters a well drawn and real.

Her father Elson is stuck in a dull job, drinks to excess and is recently divorced by his wife Cadence.  Cadence, after thirty years of marriage, finds herself questioning the meaning of her life and why she dropped out of college to marry Elson.

The parents try disparately to keep control.  Each of the people slowly learn how little control they have over othersWhat makes this story worthwhile is its close exposure of the feelings and problems typical of people in a disjointed family - a fractured family.  This is all set in homes and cafes of Houston, with satisfying enough detail to make the reader picture sections of the city that the author obviously loves.The novel is full of psychological suspense, with each of the family members worrying about the others and hoping to manipulate them a little.  A sub-theme is an intriguing tale of betrayal and forgiveness of a friend.

"There are two offerings on this product page and I am reviewing both.I’ve been drinking tea for years but I’m new to Matcha. I was excited to try these and I’m happy to report that I’m not disappointed. The difference between the two kinds of Matcha is that Kazuma is organic and Kiwami is non-organic . Also that Kiwami tastes a wee bit sweeter than Kazuma.I received a 5gm sample each of Kiwami and Kazuma , directly by the seller , in return of an unbiased and honest review from an end users point..In the package that I received, there was also a copy of the USDA certificate that verified that Kazuma is indeed organic. Both products are well controlled by strict standard of quality control. Also, both products are ground by a stone grinder. Such a stone grinder can take up to one hour to grind 30grams of Matcha and thus maintains the good taste and nutrition. Both Kiwami and Kazuma are finely ground and smell really fresh .It is best to keep the Matcha powder in the refrigerator . While making the tea , it is important that you DONOT pour in too hot water because hot water ‘burns’ the freshness and makes it taste a little bitter . I prepared the ‘koicha’ , i.e. thick tea . Although I did not have the traditional Japanese three piece set for making matcha – Whisk (chasen) , bowl (chawan) and spoon ( Chashaku) ; I managed okay by using a bowl and spoon . Another important thing to keep in mind is the process of preparing it. Instead of circular motions it is better to move it back and forth like making a ‘W’ shape until the powder is all dissolved and there are no lumps.The green tea powder by iMaccha Tea Company is undoubtedly high in quality , taste and nutrition. I personally love the taste and feel that it is an excellent quality product . I Recommend it !","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1SSZI7JF1XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QT62QII#wasThisHelpful","R2G1SSZI7JF1XK","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The speculative fiction of Three Cultural Shocks is a collection that combines the well-known fiction of Tony Thorne with time travel from the dinosaur period and stories  that are more like a fairy tale with witches and ancient statues.  ""Spellbind"" follows the plan of the village witch Old Mother Megan as she wants changes in her favor.  She may not be the most skilled witch, but her plans demonstrate her cunning.  ""Invasion"" combines the high intelligent life forms thought to be forever wiped out by the meteorites. What are their intentions in the modern world? ""Demonstration"" reminds us to always be cautious when applying for a job.  A seek-and-find mission puts a young but wise woman in a tight situation.  You will not expect this ending.  You can read each story one at a time, but you may prefer to read it all in one sitting and question what you know about the past and who you know in the present.  All of them are well written.  ""Spellbind"" is not what I typically read from Tony Thorne, but it was riveting and satisfying to the end.  If this is your first book by the author or another one to add to your personal library, you will be pleased with what you read for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7AD1UP1600D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4C531G#wasThisHelpful","R2J7AD1UP1600D","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tony Thorne has created a collectible treat.  His speculative fiction Time Travel Troubles is all about the fantastic idea of traveling to the past, future, and parallel universes and the trouble it can create.  Some refer to more intelligent life on our own planet from the dinosaur age while some describe instances in which people try to escape to the future.  The author takes the theories and the ""what ifs"" and takes the risk through fiction to determine outcomes.  The points of view of the characters who take the risk in these situations put us in the predicaments that we could not easily imagine on our own.  It also makes you wonder about the last thoughts and observations that were taken with the guinea pigs and scientists who did not survive one of those types of experiments.  Time travel is an impossibility that could make life better for the good or more destructive if in the wrong hands.  Tony Thorne has crafted a collection of thought-provoking, technical and literary time travel stories that you may want to reread every few years to see if we have come any closer to making the impossible possible.  If he is right, we will never see it in our lifetime or never witness the failures on the other side of the portal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4YM8N30VK3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFPRRDW#wasThisHelpful","R1I4YM8N30VK3R","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Location can contribute to the outcome of dating success.  It can affect the pool of eligible dating material in terms of numbers, personal values, and interests.  Dating in LA  takes the metropolitan dating scene and breaks it down to the reasons and excuses that strong, meaningful relationships are more difficult to find and keep.  It identifies dating rumors we hear from other parts of the country and breaks down the reasons and problems that we do not see.There is a logic about LA relationships in general.  The goal of moving west to LA is so vastly different than most regions in the country and plays a big role in LA dating.  The author's no-nonsense approach is agreeable to most and a forehead-smacking ""aha!""moment for those who are just opening their eyes about their failures and struggles in dating.

"The concept of artificial intelligence taking over humanity, or THE Singularity, is not a new idea.  Classic science fiction novels, comics, TV, and movies played on the fears of invasions of robots, cyborgs, and other invaders bent to destroy human beings and take over the world.  Those who survived fought to maintain control.  I grew up wondering if a scenario like The Terminator could really happen, in which a computer and its creation of cyborgs could ever be more than entertainment.  Also, could we even stop the progression of taking technology and intelligence to a higher level, that is to a point that we do not have to do anything laborious because computers will do it for us?  Tony Thorne's book - ' The Singularity is Coming ' addresses these concerns and beyond with factual detail and personal accounts to the progress artificial intelligence has made.  His prediction based on expert forecasts of a disaster greater than global warming and nuclear war.  I have read many of his speculative fiction stories, and have awed with his creativity and imagination in crafting a probable society in which we are comfortable with the common use of robots, cyborgs, androids, and other artificial intelligence that was more of a fantasy even 50 years ago.  This book takes into account his research in the area and puts it into perspective that is more likely now than it has ever been before.  You will enjoy reading in his voice and truly contemplate the future of the singularity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3T411WTPYE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1RJ0L4#wasThisHelpful","RJ3T411WTPYE2","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The positive thing about this book is that these ideas are super easy to follow and execute. These ideas will also help you to use everyday items as your storage solutions in turn leading to less clutter and less mess !! The last chapter of the book which states ideas for de-cluttering from everyday life , is the best one. I already knew some ideas which were mentioned ; however there were many new ones as well.

"JFK, was a famous American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. Over 50 years later there are still many questions being asked about the assassination. The conspiracy theories persist for a number of reasons, one of which was that he was a charismatic figure taken from us so young. Kennedy was a young . dynamic and highly charismatic, graceful figure who, in the view of many, was taking the United States in a new direction with a sense of mission and purpose. It is difficult to think clearly about Kennedy because of the memories his name evokes, coupled with the assassination and the United States' subsequent political history.

"What would you say if someone told you that all religions and philosophies were valid?  It would contradict what many have learned in their most impressionable years and have practiced for their life.  While author Aaron Laird is not promoting a particular thought, he is using the thoughts of other famous philosophers and sciences to explain this theory.  When an open mind and a critical eye examines this point of view, it opens up an honest discussion about the similarities of belief systems and the efforts of man who fight for their beliefs both in battle and in word.  References to Hilter and the religious wars are a few examples of the misinterpretation of religion and human ignorance.Dr. Laird's book is very thought-provoking and an interesting, short academic read.  It read more like an essay and I am sure that a deeper analysis could come through in a similar discussion if not an extended book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTDNESJSWVFJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0LHPVK#wasThisHelpful","RTDNESJSWVFJV","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine is a Tony Thorne Fan and she literally insisted that I read this book. I'm glad that I did :)In a time where citizens worry about drones invading their privacy, this story about model helicopters initially used for a part-time aerial photography job only to be used for questionable business practices.  Bill enjoys his hobby flying model helicopters and equips them with cameras and attachments to complete different tasks in the air.  When he is approached by a secretive man, he is unsure about his role in the jobs he wants Bill to do, but the money is a big incentive as is keeping himself alive to use it.  Will he find himself caught in a web of shady deals or can he walk away at any time.Tony Thorne is well known for his speculative fiction and science fiction stories, so this realistic fiction was a nice change for me to read.  It makes you think as to how far would you go to do a job, and is what you are doing legal even if you are not doing it directly.  It is easy to ask yourself situational questions and ""what ifs"" to put yourself in Bill's place.  Bill's wife also finds herself involved, mostly out of worry for her husband, but it is the wonderful teamwork that helps Bill brainstorm and weigh the rewards and consequences of the jobs he is asked to do for the mysterious man.  This short story is a good one to read and will keep you in suspense until the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4WH0XHH9SDN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRYUPBO#wasThisHelpful","R4WH0XHH9SDN4","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine recommended this book ....Books about Dystopic societies such as the one set in Tesla make the reader imagine themselves in a life unlike any they have ever known and one they may fear to be in their future.  The storyline makes that a possibility by explaining the events that lead up to the life they know in the book.  Seb loses everything about his family and home, and discovers he is hunted for termination but he doesn't know why.  All he knows is that he needs to get to the Steam Academy, which was his mother's last wish.  Along the way he is chased by cyborgs and helped by friends and strangers.  As the people around him are dying or struggling with their own survival, he is on a hunt to find out what happened to his mother and get to the academy. Strong for young adults, but interesting enough for mature readers as well.  It is also part one of the series, so I am interested in seeing how the story continues.

Leila's fantasy about having Ryan and John at the same time is similar to what may be on other people's sexual bucket list.  It is difficult for her to pick just one as they both excite her in their own way.  While I can understand her attraction to John, the sexy businessman who has a great deal in common with her, Ryan is a free spirit that can make a woman flustered during a conversation and lose control of their inhibitions.  With physical connections to both of them, are they game to share her?  It is a fantasy worth exploring in this story.  Maybe it was he meddling of her mother and friend.  Maybe it was the time in her life that she needs to go wild and do something crazy.  For whatever reason, Leila is taking a risk to being two lovers into bed with her, and the results are hot.

Reese had solved and ended a serial killer's blood draining spree, yet he could not shake the feeling that it went even further. He makes his way to Santa Marina, and this quiet, coastal town becomes the site of horrific murders, not to mention missing persons.  Rusty Webber can have any archaeological journey she wants so long as she helps her benefactor Rasmussen tie up a few loose ends.  As she uncovers new mysteries, her own life is in danger time and time again.  Rasmussen, well, seeing is believing, so you will have to read this supernatural thriller that combines vampire suspense and police mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PK40LXSGI0D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081L003M#wasThisHelpful","R1PK40LXSGI0D1","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The stories given in the book highlight an aspect that had gained very little attention - the importance of UDT ( Underwater Demolition Teams ) during World War 2 . Without modern day equipments , these brave men who signed up for these early teams – faced real dangers and struggles that we could have never even imagined. Life at the war was no less than hell . I was really moved while reading about the exceptionally brave men who went through so much to be of service to their country. Editing issues aside , this is a very well written small e-book with some true stories from the First Navy SEALs : The amphibious scout raiders. This book is short but is informative too. I have a lot of Ryan Jenkins books in my kindle collection . I finished reading it in one sitting . Much recommend this short e-book which would introduce you to the forerunners of today’s Special Forces Warriors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PVAGZI4QECS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T256BNE#wasThisHelpful","R35PVAGZI4QECS","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As the seasons change from summer to fall , the onset of winters slowly creeps up . In some people , this change triggers the inception of a clinical depression also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). People who suffer from SAD slowly sink into a depressed state, and often find themselves eating more , sleeping more, socializing less, and doing their routine activities less often. Although I downloaded this book on promo – I feel that whether if you suffer from this condition or not , this book is a good resource that will outline possible solutions and treatments to this depression that affects so many people every year.

"Definitely not my usual read, but I’m really glad I took a chance on this one. Loved it. Couldn’t put it down loved it. I’m the kind of romance reader who really like to focus on the interpersonal relationships, and the love story, and well, yes, the sex too, but this was actually so much more. The love story is a big part of it, but it’s only one part out of so much going on. The leading lady is a bad-ass. Totally take charge an in control. Pretty much what you’re used to seeing with male leads. But Jack is equally hot and smart and man, is that guy tenacious. This is definitely not your typical relationship, and that in and of itself made the story really good for me.As for the rest, I have to say it’s just as exciting. I'm the kind of reader where if a book takes too long to get to the juicy bits, I lose interest, but gosh there was just so much other stuff going on here! The cast of characters were really awesome too. And reading about how they operate as well as their relationships with each other was really cool.Consensus: Excellent read. This book is really well-written. I mean, the prose is fantastic. I almost can’t believe Alexi Lawless is a new author with the way she writes. (I kind of wonder if she’s another author using a pen name.  Like… Lee Child or something?) The only thing that’s tough is the ending, but as long as you like a series, it’s cool. If you want an HEA, this is not a book you want to get going on because you won’t be able to put it down. I HAVE to know what’s going to happen next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXPJ60X6IINH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW98CPA#wasThisHelpful","RXPJ60X6IINH8","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has some really easy DIY Valentine’s day gift ideas and will definitely impress anyone that you make them for.

First off, this manual hits all touches on a bunch of different metaphysical aspects - such as dreams, telepathy, shifting realities - but keeps it grounded with applicable understandings about manifestation, belief systems, energy and ascending masters.I also saw the author touch on 'magick' which was awesome. I hope he expands on that in a later book.Anyway, this is really a good manual for adding a strong layer of knowledge to the law of attraction.

"A comprehensive look back on the role the soldiers of the U. S. Navy played during the WWII . The timelines and the unfolding events are brilliantly related and turn a history book into a riveting read. The stories tell about the valor and importance of those men who fought at the sea including soldiers from the Surface Navy as well as the Merchant Marine . Good write up of such important stories and good description of a difficult time.Being too short , this ebook is a refresher or reminder of the struggles and hardships of these brave men during the WWII . I would recommend Ryan Jenkins books to anyone who is looking for brief overview about the time , for in depth study – you might want to try other authors work.

"Readers who enjoy Tony Thorne's speculative fiction may wonder how he gets inspired to write such amazing works full of detail, facts, and creativity about a world we are yet to see. In this case, readers can find his muse as the setting in Tenerife, one of the islands in the Canary Islands. While the location provides a beautiful backdrop, it also provides the author with a setting that is perfect for jungle habitats for micro-dinosaurs and volcano experiments. These are tall tales, but there is something about them that makes the reader feel like it could happen if it isn't already in the works now. Whether the characters are amateur scientists or professional PhDs, the stories are easy to read as well as entertaining. Any type of technical terminology is still comprehensible to the average readers who want nothing more than a great read from an imaginative author. Some just make you think how we have evolved while others can be debated if science is trying too hard to create or recreate things that the world is not ready for. These stories vary in context and length, so there is always the chance to find a favorite piece or storyline within the variety of tales from the Tenerife Island.Highly recommended !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EG2EB5L1YTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4QNGDY#wasThisHelpful","R30EG2EB5L1YTI","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really good dialog novel. The book came recommended by a friend of mine who had read it and said to me that I would get attached to the characters. It took a little getting used to Zandri's writing style and I had to give him some credit, for a first release it was really above average. Once I got comfortable with the style of the story I became attached to the characters and found myself wanting to read ahead to see what happened to them next. It seemed like a slow build up but it caught me by surprise..The outline of the writing indirectly turns you. At times it is a false turn and sets you right back onto the storyline you're expecting and other times it takes you right off track. After a while you end up second guessing what happens next to the main characters.The main characters are everyday people. They are flawed. They have been knocked down and run over. Most have every reason to withdraw but they fight to resist that. You root for them to rise above their own shortcomings. The story is set in such a way to remind us of that human condition to try to be a little more than you already are and to realize that you cannot truly appreciate the heights of success without appreciating the depths of loss.This story will move you. You will not be able to resist feeling it.Much recommended !","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18BWEGOM1QI4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QD2FQU8#wasThisHelpful","R18BWEGOM1QI4K","A2J6GMCZHMVX18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6GMCZHMVX18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know there has been a lot of discussion in regards to male enhancement recently and so in my quest to educate myself more about this topic in general, I found this book to be very interesting and informative about Jelqing, the history of it and the technique. I had never hear of Jelqing previously, so this practice was intriguing. I suppose it is not part of the mainstream discussion when it comes to male enhancement because there is no prescription of some pills or product to buy - with maybe the exception of lubrication. So, since the pharmaceutical companies can't sell a product for it, it isn't something you hear so much about. It is a technique that any man can practice either by himself or with his partner. Although I'm not certain to what degree it is effective, but it is another approach to male enhancement without chemicals or pumps or other expensive products that are on the market today. The book is very well written and matter of fact. It is very informative, thought provoking and written in a mature and respectable manner.

"This is a really effective essential oil for foot and nail fungus and a host of other things. Although as a topical treatment, it helps to kill off fungus on the skin and nails. It eliminates the foot fungus and keeps the nail fungus under control. This stuff also works amazing on insect bites. Just a tiny amount applied to the skin stops the itch. It is also a great product to use on minor skin irritations to disinfect the skin and promote healing. I am a big fan of essential oils and this one is a must to have in the medicine cabinet. It is 100% pure and natural, so you know you are getting the best product for your skin without any chemicals or additives that will irritate the skin.

"I really am impressed with this Super Instamometer! This item gives a highly accurate and precise temperature reading every time. I have never seen a thermometer with such a wide range before. The temperature range on this is from -58 to +572 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 to +300C) so it is very versatile for checking temperatures on both cold and hot items. I have put it in the refrigerator to make sure it is operating at at least 40F or colder. I have tested it on food items as well. It gives an instant and continuous reading as the temperature goes up or down. It also has a Min and Max temperature memory which can also be helpful. It is super easy to use. Simply press the on/off button and select between Celsius or Fahrenheit and it is ready to go. It also will turn itself off in 15 minutes. It comes with an extra battery too - which is very convenient. This is a very accurate and excellent product for testing food temperatures and without having to wait. The reading is instant. I have included a couple of pictures of it that you can check out too.

"My 12 year old had been wanting to learn how to play the Ukulele and when she saw this one, she decided this was the one she wanted the most. She loved the color.

"The Phylink PLC – 128 Series is a covert network security camera that is easy to set up and operate. This IP camera allows you to access the live viewing of your camera from your computer, smart phone or tablet, or from any web browser anywhere in the world – in real time. I own this camera and wanted to share my review and some information that could be helpful to anyone getting one of these also.Hardware:  The main unit is what everything plugs into and operates the camera. This is very easy to set up, so don’t be intimidated if you are not very tech savvy. The manual included is very well written and guides you step by step. On one end of the main unit you plug in your Ethernet cable and plug in the other end to the router. On the other end of the main unit is where you plug in the camera. Screw on the antenna, plug in the power adaptor and you are ready to go. There is a slot for a micro SD card that the camera records to when using motion detection. The unit records to the SD card at 30.3MB per minute and records continuously over the previous video once it has reached the memory capacity. There is a jack for a line-in microphone on the main unit too if you want to have audio as well. The camera also comes with mounting hardware that allows you to mount the camera either in plain view - straight on or at a 45 degree angle, or covertly behind a wall. The camera itself is very small. The lens is about the size of one on a smart phone. The casing around it is made of steel and has two holes at the bottom which makes it easy to mount. Attached to the camera is about 26 feet (8 meters) of cable. Everything is constructed and manufactured well and seems to be made of quality materials.Software: To see the video from the camera live on your computer screen, install the software CD that is included. It is a very simple and quick installation. After the software is installed, you can click on the Phylink icon on your home screen to see the live viewing window. When the window opens, you have a toolbar along the top that helps you easily navigate the program. From here you can add your camera and even multiple cameras that you can view. After you have added a camera, then you will see an indicator on the window showing if it is connected or disconnected. My camera always connected quickly every time – within about 10 to 15 seconds. You can then click on the camera window and see it larger on your screen. On this screen you have record, snapshot and control options for the camera. When you record, the video is saved onto a file within the Documents folder in your computer. From the main screen you can also set up your camera so that you can view it remotely from a web browser. You can do this from the Setup tab.The App:  To view the video from your smart phone, you can download the Phycam app for free on The App Store. Once installed, you can add a camera in the same way as on the computer and access the functions of the camera.  It is recommended that you have a current version of IOS 9 or newer. I had some delay issues that had to do with using an older version.The Camera: The Phylink PLC – 128 is an indoor camera and not made for outdoor use. However, you can easily mount it by a window inside for outdoor viewing. The quality and clarity of the camera is impressive. The video quality is very clear with optimal lighting. But, just as with any video camera, as it becomes darker, the picture becomes more pixilated. The brighter the lighting, the better the quality of the video. It works fine in normal lighting conditions.Potential Problems & Fixes: Although I had no problems whatsoever with the camera or equipment, there are a few things worth mentioning in regards to technical issues you may encounter and how to fix them. As I mentioned previously, you need to have an up-to-date operating system for the app to work correctly on your smartphone. Another app you can try if you have issues with the Phycam app is one called Anyscene.  I set up and tested this camera at two different locations using Wi-Fi. One location was at an office with multiple computers connected to the internet. The other location was at home with only a couple of computers online. I did encounter about a 5 second delay in the video at the office, but none at all at home. So, I assume the delay at the office was due to the number of computers using the internet. At home it worked perfectly in real time. For downloads and software updates, you can find them at http://www.phylink.com/downloads/index.htmConclusion: This camera is very quick and easy to set up.  It is made of quality materials and is constructed well. The long cable between the camera and the main unit allows you to set up the camera a good distance from the router connection. You can also connect a longer Ethernet cable between the router and main unit if you need more distance to work with.  Mounting the camera is also very easy. The mounting hardware allows you to set it up in the position you want for best viewing.  Navigation of the toolbar and live viewing screen on the computer is user friendly and easy to understand. The user’s manual is very well written and illustrated. The instructions cover the complete setup of the camera as well as the software and app installation.  The video from the camera is very clear. The technical support is superb and prompt. They are very helpful when it comes to answering any questions or addressing any issues you may have, and that is a major plus! The app allows you to view the video and operate its functions remotely. So does the computer software. This camera works well and comes with a number of convenient features. I am very pleased with the quality and how user-friendly it is to set up and operate","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WZFGJZ5W5P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8DOAWA#wasThisHelpful","R6WZFGJZ5W5P8","AU6WZTHO3RVFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU6WZTHO3RVFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always been fascinated by the personality types of people, what makes them think and react the way they do and what they believe and why. I have also been quite interested in understanding my own personality type and what causes me to be set in my own ways. This book is highly informative and insightful about understanding the ISFJ personality type based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) I discovered that my own father was more of an ISFJ and this book was very helpful for me to understand his thoughts, feelings and decision making capabilities. My father was a brilliant parent and I really respected the way he handled things when it came to parenting even though he and I really had very different perspectives and often conflicting opinions about a number of various subjects. This book provides a great deal of interesting and compelling details about the working of the ISFJ protector type of personality. After reading this, I am more intrigued to learn more about the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and discover more about my own personality as well as others who were influential in my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GJKK7PFEK5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T280T2K#wasThisHelpful","R32GJKK7PFEK5S","AU6WZTHO3RVFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU6WZTHO3RVFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been very pleased with the results of this cream. I like the way it feels on my skin. It goes on smooth and doesn't leave a greasy or sticky residue.

"We have sweet dog that is cute as can be, but had this little problem of loud, excessive barking. She would just start barking for no apparent reason at all and wouldn't know when to quit. It became quite annoying. There was nothing that we could figure out that would deter this behavior. One day at work I overheard one of our customers talking about how he used this collar to gently train his dog not to impulsively bark. I asked him about what that product was and he referred me to this collar.I am really pleased with this product. It is a safe, humane and effective method of training your dog.

I didn't like the idea of using black tape which leaves a sticky residue. I discovered this webcam cover here and ordered it. I am really happy with this product. It is a perfect fit to cover the cam and thin enough at the same time that I can close the laptop without it interfering with it closing. It is made of a soft, spongy kind of material that doesn't scratch any surfaces. I also really like that you can use it over and over again. It sticks perfectly to the surface of the laptop every time and never leaves any residue.

"This is an action-packed, highly engaging and very entertaining story. Because of the fast pace of the book, it really locks you in and holds your attention. What I liked most about the book was the character dialogue. It is not easy to write natural sounding dialogue but this author really is able to do so in a manner where you feel like you are right there in the scene. Because of this, you get a real feel for the characters and the plot as well as a great visual of the setting. The book also flows really well from each chapter and scene keeping you reading and waiting to see what will happen next. Excellent creative writing, visual storytelling and dialogue.

"This book is the true story of Dr. Elsayed and documents his life, his challenges and his triumphs. It is a highly engaging and thought provoking true story and it really causes you to reflect and put things into perspective. This book is difficult to read at times in the sense that it makes you frustrated and upset with the legal system in the U.S. and how terribly unfairly a person can be treated as well. I really liked the way Dr. Elsayed expressed himself in such an open and honest way. For me, this is what made the story very powerful and made me want to keep reading.

"It’s certainly one of the very few books that do their best to correct rather than cement the widely held misconceptions about North Korea. It confirms what I had already learned from a rare insider memoir, Felix Abt’s “A Capitalist in North Korea: My Seven Years in the Hermit Kingdom”, where he explains, from personal experience and with plenty of examples, that North Korea isn’t stuck in the past, but has been undergoing dramatic changes in recent years. Abt not only witnessed this transition, but implemented, or was a party to, many ground breaking reforms himself.Abt’s lively depiction of life in contemporary North Korea and his ventures and adventures are full of eye-opening surprises, especially to those unused to an informed, impartial portrayal of life in the country. Similarly, North Korea itself may well surprise observers, not as the source of sensationalist headlines loved by Western media, but with tales of moderation, change and advancement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149R73K3YZSPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1W9OPM#wasThisHelpful","R149R73K3YZSPO","AU6WZTHO3RVFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AU6WZTHO3RVFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yoga is defined as the union of the individual soul with the cosmic soul and the state of oneness with the higher self, so the yoga of relationships is about the double union between self and source and self and other. While we are born knowing our connection to source, we lose it through constant abrasion against the reality of our parents, peers, and surroundings. We then spend much of the rest of our lives trying to recapture this feeling of connection. Yogi Desai suggests that we use our relationships as mirrors to reflect back to us who we think we are, and may be attracted to another person because we like the image we think they see. These relationships with people, food, entertainment, substances may give us some temporary pleasure and relief from pain or fear, but they also may lead to addictions and dependencies. The most important relationship in our lives is the one we have with ourselves, and unless we love and accept ourselves, how can we expect others to love and accept us?""Understand that in all significant relationships, we project our own unmet emotional needs and desires onto those we love.”When life moves on and people change, we lose our anchor. We become fixated on holding on to the past because we fear the unknown that lies ahead. The only way to move forward and create a new future for ourselves is to release anger and adopt forgiveness – and that includes forgiving ourselves.There is a section about our relationship to food that many will resonate with. Yogi Desai points out that we often use food to fill our inner emptiness, a sign of spiritual starvation. We have distorted the basic function of food as a source of nourishment and made it primarily a source of pleasure. He urges us to return to the design of Mother Nature, treating food with respect and gratitude. To end spiritual starvation, start by feeding the soul. On a practical basis, he suggests eating half as much and chewing twice as long.The final chapter talks about love as union, and he already defined yoga as union, so the yoga of relationships is really the practice of rekindling the awareness of our union with the divine and of our essence as love. With this as our foundation we can move forward into any relationship with trust and joy.This is a small book with some profound (and possibly hard-earned) wisdom about relationships, and provides valuable food for thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332LM82NL9GZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193968143X#wasThisHelpful","R332LM82NL9GZP","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a delightful memoir from an intelligent and deeply thoughtful woman. Growing up in England during World War II, Toinette Lippe was deeply imprinted with the ethos of hard work and making do with very little imposed by wartime austerity, which in England persisted well into the 1950s. She was discouraged from pursuing “male” professions for which her formidable intellect was suited, so she trained as a secretary and went into publishing. She was hired out from under the nose of her British publisher boss by the US head of Simon and Schuster. She  progressed from secretary to editor with Alfred A Knopf and eventually was responsible for an entire imprint.Jewish by birth and Buddhist by inclination, she was a committed workaholic with a passion for beauty, simplicity and minimalism, traits she carried into her active urban retirement that includes writing, editing, travel and Asian brush painting. Her personal story and observations on life are told with enormous charm and humor.

"My life after deathThis book occupies a special niche between the growing numbers of first-hand accounts of near-death experiences and channeled books about the afterlife. While it is channeled through a medium, or spiritual translator as she prefers to be called, the voice of 20-year-old Erik Medhus comes through with such clarity and integrity that you have the sense of a living presence behind the transcription. The text is down-to-earth and liberally peppered with the vulgarities and usages of young males. That, however, is part of what makes this book uniquely valuable. It speaks directly to those who are vulnerable and hurting in language they can resonate with.When Erik took his own life, he could have been just another statistic among the epidemic of alienated and emotionally disturbed youth (as well as adults and seniors) who have lost all sense of hope and meaning in their lives. He suffered from a complex of emotional troubles from ADHD to bipolar disorder, and the detailed description he gives of his mental state leading up to his suicide is worthy of being studied by professionals and parents of kids with these challenges.  Erik, however, did not go quietly because he had a mission.He rapidly developed the ability to appear either visually or in dreams, first to members of his immediate family and then to members of the online community gathering around his mother's blog, channelingErik.com, which she started as a means of dealing with her grief. As he acclimated to life on the ""other side"" Eric came to realize that he had planned his life path in order to gain empathy for those suffering from mental illness and depression, as well as from grief and loss. The mission he undertook was to help as many people as possible understand both our immortality and our interconnection – we don't die and we are never alone. We always have beings around us to guide and support us if we but listen and/or ask.Erik’s descriptions about what happened to him after a passing offer a number of original observations, but mostly echo reports from much of the near-death literature. The wonder and delight of this book is truly in the voice of this extraordinary young man – a voice full of humor, the energy of youth, and a passion for living and helping others.Just as his physician mother overcame her science oriented skepticism and embraced the notion of a vibrant afterlife, so whatever level of skepticism you may start out with, you will turn the last page with a strengthened confidence that while our role in this universe may shift and change, it will never end. You are left with a quiet smile on your face and perhaps a nagging sense that you might want to get your act together because down the line you're going to be your own judge and jury. The good news is that everybody else will still love you - unconditionally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DSQ639IPC1U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582705607#wasThisHelpful","R3DSQ639IPC1U5","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Great Year is a cosmic saga that follows the tempestuous loves and conflicts of its three main characters across the 26 millennia of the axial precession or Great Year, from the time of Atlantis to the present. As they weave their way through multiple incarnations, they bring to life the complex dance of relationships believed by many in esoteric circles to occur within soul groups in order to work out their karmic destiny.The love triangle between Theron, Marcus and Helghul sets the stage for an exploration of love and longing, passion and rejection, anger and jealousy, ambition and service, good and evil – in short all of the primal passions, dark forces and noble impulses animating the human spirit. They are followed through wars, cultural flowerings and conflicts throughout history to an apocalyptic climax.The action and the narrative are brilliantly realized, and the authors build upon historical records as well as myths and legends to re-create the eras of Plato and Genghis Khan, for example, which are then overlaid with the character, lives, lusts, and enmity of the protagonists. The book is very visual and visceral, and would make a fantastic movie. The challenge would be to translate the epic scope of this book into a two-hour screenplay.

"This book is fascinating, witty, intelligent, informative, disturbingly visionary, and alternately funny and scary as hell. The authors, R.U. Sirius (no, not his real name) and Jay Cornell have put together a guide to terms most people haven't heard about, or only vaguely recognize, that describe scientific and technological developments already well advanced and that will inevitably change modern life as we know it. You know those science fiction movies like 2001, Terminator, and the Matrix? Their respective premises are no longer far out nor far away.The book revolves around the concepts of trans-humanism and the singularity. Trans-humanism relates to radical technological alteration of the human body – mind, including genetic manipulation and biomechanical and electronic implants. The singularity refers to the crossover point when artificial intelligence becomes smarter than human beings. Probably the most high profile proponent of this is Ray Kurzweil, who predicts the singularity to occur in 2045.The authors combine history, science, and technology with a good dollop of philosophy and humor. It makes great reading for trivia addicts, but also raises profound questions and issues that any reflective individual should be aware of. Dorothy, we are not in Kansas anymore and there's no going back, so we had better start thinking about the moral, ethical and survival issues related to going forward with little or no oversight or restraint. This book provides the signposts to this new Land of Oz, and describes the major players – in front of and behind the curtains. This is not a text book nor a book for people well-versed in the science. It is a good introduction to terms and concepts most will find unfamiliar, but whose implications deserve to be contemplated by all of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0RWAVWUPQ1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938875095#wasThisHelpful","R1U0RWAVWUPQ1Q","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got this for review, I was intrigued and immediately searched the house for colored pencils to try it out. I couldn't find them and tried markers, but you really need sharpened pencils to have the control you need to cope with some of the the mind-blowingly intricate designs in the book. I then discovered that there is a whole genre of adult coloring books, and I'm not surprised. The concentration required to do a decent job of staying in the lines has just the right level of mindlessness to put one into a meditative state - rather like walking a labyrinth - and it is most therapeutic. The added bonus is that you can express your mood and artistic vision through your choice of colors, and have something to show for it afterwards. The individual pages come out cleanly if you want to frame your hard-earned masterpiece.

"It is exciting to see so many people opening up to the magic of the universe and tuning into their psychic abilities. As with artists or musicians, there are many different ways they express their vision of what they are inspired to communicate.  Psychic mediums generally use their gifts to bring comfort, healing of the spirit and a better understanding of “how things work,” the purpose of life and the nature of death and the afterlife.In Soul Secrets, Miki Jacobs introduces her own concept of the “TEAM,” a group of spirits that surrounds each of us throughout our physical life, and help us through the transition of death into the harvest of wisdom from our earthly experiences. The Team is made up of the Archangels, Guardian Angels, Spirit Guides, and a Departed Loved One. Everyone has them, and Miki provides a detailed list of ways to connect with them and to see signs in everyday occurrences that can reassure us that we are never alone. Two-way communication is possible and immensely helpful, she says, and gives instructions on how to do automatic writing. The secret to developing your own abilities to communicate with your team is practice, especially through a discipline of meditation.Ever since seeing the movie, Despicable Me, I’ve secretly wanted my own team of Minions.

"There are a gazillion diet books out there, and we already know we should be eating a healthy diet and exercising, so it is refreshing to find a book that actually addresses all the excuses we use to avoid doing so. Dr. James Rouse’s mission is all about helping his patients and his readers achieve the lifestyle and mindset shift to create a healthy life. You can sense the energy and passion leaping off the page, as he explains the science (in layman’s terms) and the psychology behind the factors that rob us of a long, rewarding and vigorous life.His integrated body-mind-spirit approach starts with how we think. Are we buoyed and motivated by a grand vision of who we want to be and what we want to contribute, or is our essence submerged in a sea of negativity from past hurts, self-doubt and the daily news. His prescription for change is based on many years of observing and coaching successful people. It incorporates principles and action steps for kick-starting your day with early rising, meditation, movement or exercise of some kind, and healthy eating.It is not a diet, but rather guidelines on what to eliminate and what to emphasize in your diet. His diet and exercise recommendations reflect the best of current research, and if followed, would produce noticeable improvement in a fairly short time. The “Thrive” part of his title is both an outcome of the recommendations of the first three parts, as well as a heartfelt exhortation to become the best you possible.All in all, an upbeat and doable recipe for physical and mental transformation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21E0TKG7UJVRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582704929#wasThisHelpful","R21E0TKG7UJVRP","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Drawing on the spiritual texts and traditions of many religions, the Martella-Whitsett makes a bold case for each of us to claim our own spark of divinity. Beginning from a foundation of meditation she guides you into using and cultivating your imagination to find an expression of divine identity that you feel comfortable inhabiting.As a divine being or a spark of the divine, one has the obligation to make the most of the gift of life. The author points out that, “the opposite of life is not death. The opposite of life is stagnation. The currency of life is divine ideas, the limitless possibilities that we either quash or set in motion.”  So remind yourself that you give life to your dreams, and that only the dreams that you give life to, live.

It talks about the great value of laughter not only to  improving your mental state but your physical state as well.  The hormones released by laughing relax the blood vessels, lower your blood pressure and reduce other markers of stress. The good news is that you can fake it till you make it. Faking  or forcing laughter, it turns out, gives you pretty much the same benefits as doing the real thing spontaneously. The author went to India to study with the originator of laughter yoga, which has been catching on around the world because it's fun as well as healthful. So how about it, let's gather in groups and get our giggle on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB4CDH0QOP7Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780286740#wasThisHelpful","RB4CDH0QOP7Z8","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are always times in our lives when everything seems to be falling apart and you really don't know where to turn.  They say that that which doesn't break us makes us stronger.  They don't say that it's not going to hurt, nor that it's going to be easy to turn around. So the question is, are you going to fight or close down? That's the subject of this book by a former star athlete turned hopeless addict turned Unity Minister. Having been there herself, Temple Hayes is particularly well-placed to provide insight and guidance – and indeed a whole rooting section to encourage you and show you how to take back the reins of your life.

"This book provides an impressively wide-ranging overview of the interrelationships and interdependencies among the environmental, economic, sociological, and political issues at play in the world today. They feed into the rather pressing question of whether humanity will be able to continue its existence on this planet with some semblance of order and dignity, or whether our social and environmental systems will break down into chaos.As clearly evidenced from the exhaustive annotation and impressive detail, the book is aimed at academics, researchers, and decision-makers charged with navigating their companies, organizations or political institutions into the precarious and unknown territory ahead. While the authors are both academics, their roots are firmly planted in the real world and the warnings and conclusions they offer cannot be lightly dismissed. This book is at once sober and sobering. For example, according to the World Wildlife Fund, 35% of the world's natural wealth has been lost over the past 30 years alone.Lay on top of that the growing inequalities between rich and poor; the dwindling supplies of mined and extracted resources like fresh water, oil, uranium, rare earths, lithium (for batteries), which have all reached peak status; climate change; environmental degradation due to agricultural and industrial pollution; and the growing pressures of developing countries understandably wanting to move into a Western-style consumer society. Coupled with the exponential rise in the world's population, it does not take a PhD to appreciate that our current global standard of living, particularly in the West, is not only unsustainable, but precarious in the extreme.I would say that one of the greatest contributions of this book is to point out the insular and self-serving nature of academic, governmental and corporate research, and to issue a clarion call for interdisciplinary collaborations in order to have some chance of coming up with workable solutions to benefit the greater whole. Make no mistake, playtime is over as is business as usual. It's time for all of us to step into our responsibilities as grown-ups and to demand urgent action from those in power, as well as to take those individual actions and choices that we know in our hearts can make a difference, however small.While this book is valuable in defining the problems and indicating where we need to change, at the end of the day it's up to each of us. The authors are optimistic that we will collectively step up to the plate. Let's hope that we do so before we’ve passed the final tipping point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1491TICB2JTUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783531517#wasThisHelpful","R1491TICB2JTUU","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I resonated very strongly with this book, probably because I have a very independent streak and don’t like the idea that we are here being judged on whether we learn this or that lesson well enough, or if we’ve been really good or bad. What this book does, differently from most other books dealing with manifestation and the law of attraction, is to present a picture of reality that is at once really liberating and rather intimidating. Liberating in the sense of making one's particular manifestation of reality a matter between you and your consciousness/soul. Angels, demons, past lives and past misdeeds can be set aside; what matters is recognizing your existence in the eternal now, and allowing the passion of your soul to resonate within you.Enlightenment is as easy – and as difficult – as integrating the consciousness of your soul into the physical reality of your humanity. The engine that drives your manifestations is passion, which attracts the energy needed from the the limitless resources of the universe. The tricky part is that whether the passion is positive or negative, it is still effective in creating your life experience. That’s the scary part.Passion is different from emotion, which is a process of the mind based on thought and associations with memory. Passion is the feeling essence that gives form and substance to the energy flow that results in the physical experience. According to Adamus, we are soon going to see amazing breakthroughs in the understanding of ""natural physics,” which will open up our perspectives of reality from the limited linear perspective based on time, space, and matter to an unlimited perspective based on the consciousness of the of the observer.As our consciousness expands so will our ability to manifest our life experiences without getting sucked into the drama. All will be seen merely as experience and an opportunity for growth. So, at the end of the day, whether we revel in the joy of experiencing this adventure of being human, or get sucked into pain and drama and powerlessness, it’s all up to us. Absolute freedom!

"I found the material soft and not too tight, but the headphone disks moved around freely in the sleeve. I supposed that is an advantage in that you can adjust the position to where your ears are, but that also means they can slide out of position as you move your head around. I also thought the headphone disks were larger and harder than I expected from reading the other reviews.

"I received the Lavender candle from the manufacturer to try, and I was pleased with the whole concept. It's perfect for spoiling yourself or a loved one with a candle-lit bath followed by a warm oil body rub. The lavender essential oil gives it a delightful aroma that is strong and natural, and lingers on the skin for a while until it is completely absorbed. The warm oil goes on smoothly, and the little pool of liquid wax/oil doesn't get too hot, even right after you have blown out the flame. It leaves the skin soft, with little danger of irritation, given the evident purity and quality of the ingredients.

"“Switch On” provides intelligent tools for understanding and overcoming the barriers to thriving in a climate of rapid change and uncertainty. Nick Jankel synthesizes his formidable knowledge of psychology and philosophy, biology and business, to explain how experiences, especially from early childhood, create habits of thought and behavior that become hard-wired in our brains and by-pass our conscious control.  In a breezy style attuned to Gen-Xers and Millennials, he describes the roots of the problems and self-sabotaging reaction patterns that lead to stress and despair. With just enough science to inform but not confuse, he explains the psychological and biochemical mechanisms that literally anchor doubts and fears in our mind-body, that lead us to switch off to avoid pain and unpleasant emotions, and give up on our dreams in the process. Once we can recognize what we’re doing to ourselves, we can reverse the process and start reclaiming our life force and switch on to the full creative essence of our being.The book  is  simple, without being simplistic, and cleverly illustrated with graphics and typography. For example, the J-shaped curve that describes the 10 stages of the breakdown-breakthrough process drives home the point that things usually have to get pretty painful before we are motivated enough to change. On the downward slope of the J are the problems, patterns and pain that got us to the point of wanting to change. At the bottom we have the point of presence, where we open our minds to the reality of our situation and come to terms with it. Once you come to terms with it you can choose to “metabolize” this problem, as Jankel says, using it to fuel your upward drive to a resolution. You also have the choice not to do anything, which leaves you wallowing in the status quo. The choice to deal with it, to recognize it for what it is, open your mind to the possibility of alternatives, and then to act on it, is what propels you on the upward slope to resolution and power and possibility.If it were easy to make the right choices, the world would be a different place. However, the insights, thoughts for contemplation, and tools Jankel provides help bring clarity and understanding to how our personal defense mechanisms are working; and as they say: the truth will set you free. By recognizing when and why we go into fear and protection mode, and consciously moving towards connection with source, we can stop cringing and get creative. Being a generation or two older, I was surprised to find how much I resonated with this book.  (Note to publisher: being nearsighted I was actually able to read the teeny print, but it was a challenge!) The advice, which sounds hip and contemporary, reverberates with the wisdom of millennia.Echoing the great wisdom teachers, he calls us to recognize our interconnectedness, and notes that we are innately wired for compassion, not for greed and indifference. In fact our greatest rush comes from oxytocin, the feel-good hormone that floods in when we feel love and connection, and know that we're doing good in the world. Yes, it takes effort, but the alternatives are leading us off a cliff. So, whether you’re a Gen-Xer in a soul-destroying job, a millennial who can’t find a job at all, or a boomer who will never be able to retire, you will find inspiration and guidance in this book on how to take your destiny - and the planet’s - into your own hands. This is the time to switch on and Nick Jankel is a wisdom teacher for this time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BHZPR3TERTJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780288336#wasThisHelpful","R1BHZPR3TERTJJ","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is modest and intimate in tone, but vast and lofty in ambition. History and folk tales weave through the narrative like warp and weft, while nature provides the ancient patterns that we have forgotten. Parry explores the devolution of our relationship with nature, and urges a return to Original Thinking, which perceives life as an integral whole, fed by knowledge and inspiration from the natural environment.There was a turning point in art history when the ability to depict perspective took us outside of the frame where we became the observer rather than an integral part of the picture. This illustrated both a conceptual and spiritual separation from what was observed that culminated in the age of reason, and the dominance of rational thought over feeling and intuition. While we gained the ability to develop science, mathematics and technology, it came at the cost of our estrangement from nature and from ourselves as spirit. Not seeing ourselves as a part of the flow of creation and kin to all life cuts us off from the source of love that sustains our balance and vitality. Parry urges us to reconnect to the ground of our being with our roots firmly planted in the soil of compassion and love for ourselves and for all of nature.Parry is very passionate about rethinking our system of education. When we look at the process of education as a way to learn from but not be bound by the past, we encourage curiosity and exploration of ideas, unshackled by academic conventions and received wisdom. Higher education is not serving us well because of the division of academia into more and more specialized disciplines; this encourages myopic thinking and leads people to lose sight of the interconnections among all subjects and the cross-fertilization that would leave all minds enriched. He urges us to see education not just as a path to earning a living, but as an initiation into one's life purpose. It should be a system that maximizes our creativity and encourages the use of all of our human aspects – our spiritual, intuitive, mental and physical selves – as an integrated whole.This book is a clarion call to nourish our roots before they wither. It has the air of ancient tales told around the fire, drawing us into the beauty that is our birthright, and a sense of relationship and community with all of life.

"I received this glass teapot and infuser with the pink butterfly on the lid from Tea Beyond teas for review, along with a combo box of deliciously fragrant teas . I must admit that they had me at the butterfly. The little teapot holds two good-size cups or three smaller ones. Because the pot and infuser are clear glass, you can enjoy watching the tea flowers unfurl, or just judge the strength of the tea you are brewing. You can pour a second batch of water over the tea(carefully to not disturb the flower, if you are using one), but expect the delicate flavor to diminish on a second batch.Getting back to the teapot - it wasn't just about the pink butterfly, which, by the way, you need to hold down when you pour or the lid will fly away. It is just a great little pot for one or two cups. It is well-designed with a no-drip spout, feels comfortable in the hand when you pour, and because the infuser is glass as well it will always be clean and not affect the flavor.

The instructions say that you can pour a second batch of water over (carefully to not disturb the flower), but I think the delicate flavor was lost on a second batch.

The aroma is lightly perfumed and the flavor is like a delicate green tea. I was not able to discern much difference in flavor among the various ""flower buds"" but I thought they were all lovely, and am using them as a treat for myself or to share with a friend, since my husband doesn't like green tea.I really liked the loose teas - Jasmine Green, Black Caramel and Black Earl Gray. They were all made of whole leaves, with no tea dust - really high quality.  Because of this, they may need to steep a bit longer than most people may be used to, but the resulting flavor is clean, fresh, aromatic and rewarding. My English husband prefers a more robust flavor, so he will stick with the Earl Gray, which had lemon peel in it, rather than the oil of bergamot that most people associate with it. I thought it was pleasant but not memorable and not really what I think of as Earl Gray. My favorites were the Jasmine green tea and Caramel Black.Getting back to the teapot - it wasn't just about the pink butterfly, which, by the way, you need to hold down when you pour or the lid will fly away.

"So you are trying to eliminate junk food, but sometimes you just NEED something salty and crunchy. Simply 7 to the rescue! I've tried both the Lentil and the Quinoa chips, and Quinoa is my favorite. It has a much better crunch, and a slightly better flavor, though the lentil chips are also nice. It even, surprisingly, is much higher in protein than the lentil - 7 gm vs. 2 gm per serving. They are non-GMO certified, which is relevant, since the Quinoa chips contain corn flour and corn starch, and are made with sea salt. On the minus side, they also contain a bit of sugar, however less than 1 gram. You do wonder if they really needed it, since the lentil chips don't have any.These snacks are gluten-free, use reasonably decent and much less oil for cooking, are nutritious, high protein and free of additives - and they're delicious.

"This is a book to be experienced and savored along multiple dimensions – the visual, the intellectual, and one I would call the timeless. Indeed one’s sense of time melds with the narrative and takes on a whole different rhythm; time is measured in eons as it carries one's imagination gracefully through successive waves of creation and evolution.The story is told across two-page spreads in this sumptuously rendered large-format edition. On the right side of each spread is an illustration – beautifully rendered, sinuous, almost psychedelic - upon which the author has penned an often-amusing encapsulation of events. On the facing page is the detailed narrative, which takes the reader through the annals of cosmic history, using the Helianx as protagonists.The Helianx are a fascinating cultural invention, being vast creatures who are so successful in living in harmony within their environment – feeding off cosmic energy and regulating their procreation to keep their population stable – that they are able to spend the eons in contemplation, creating poetry and song, and observing other civilizations through their telepathic abilities, and later through direct contact during their nomadic travels across the universes, and recording their cultures.As they assimilate all this wisdom, they look for a way to preserve it for eternity, and thereby hangs the tale.While this is the author's first fictional book, it incorporates themes and stories about the celestial hierarchy found in his earlier writings, including the Rebel Angels series, as well is as in such diverse sources as the Urantia book, the Bible, and the work of Zechariah Sitchin. It is delightful as a cosmic fable, yet also very intriguing as a colorful backstory to the creation myth most of us learned in childhood. The book is relatively short, and a compelling and thoroughly enjoyable read. You finish it with a sense of bemusement, and you will probably never look at time the same again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBNSRTCXWENM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935187082#wasThisHelpful","R2LBNSRTCXWENM","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a cry from the heart from a scientist who has his feet firmly planted on the ground and his spiritual roots drawing from the wisdom of the ages.Long known as a teacher of ancient wisdom made relevant for the modern world, Greg looks at our present society in the context of both the degradation we are inflicting on our environment and the almost limitless capacity we have for inventive solutions to the thorniest questions facing us today.Greg's voice is a refreshing call for honesty in dealing with the problems facing humanity – an honesty that is submerged by the voices of self interest, nationalism, and political correctness, as well as the voices of conspiracy theorists and political journalists who may be using fear - each for their own ends.He traces the root of our difficulties in dealing with our problems to the hierarchy of thinking inherited from our past, particularly thinking based in the false assumptions of science. These assumptions suggest that we can solve all our problems through competition, force, and conflict. Throw enough money at a problem, and industry will come up with a technological fix for whatever might ail us – in medicine, energy, in agriculture, and so on. The thinking that he proposes instead is based in cooperation, understanding and mutual aid. It is only through acknowledging our mutual interdependence – across the planet – that we will marshal the best minds and creativity available, combining them to bring forth the solutions that will pull us back from the brink of disaster, towards which we are wrongheadedly advancing.The good news is that there is no shortage of solutions. These solutions are based in the notion of resilience. Resilience is something that used to be built into heavy machinery or electronics to provide redundancy for failure. It was a way to ensure that if one system failed another one would take up the slack. Our global systems are teetering on the brink as are our resources. We do have solutions available both in the short-term and the long-term. The short-term fixes are primarily to buy us time for the long-term solutions.The good news is there that there are many individuals and organizations who have been working with this mindset and making impressive advances. It is most encouraging to read about them, and it is hoped that they will that their example will lead the way to more and more creative innovators. There will probably never be a consensus as to what a better world will look like. As Greg points out, there will probably be as many opinions as there are people. The thing is, that it is in the collective that the pieces of the puzzle come together – that the contributions of the individual elements will make a greater, more coherent and sustainable whole.This is a call to action, and make no mistake about it – it is a call that needs to be heeded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M210MPJJQ0W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8KX73Y#wasThisHelpful","R2M210MPJJQ0W8","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As this demographic bulge of boomers enters the third age, we are faced with a choice – in fact a number of choices. We can accept the "" sentence"" of age and decay, with all the associated degenerative illnesses, and try to make the best of our twilight years. Alternatively, we can revel in the opportunities for personal expansion and contribution to the community that come with the release from the confines of the workplace.It would be a great pity to waste the fruits of all the wisdom we have acquired in over half a century of living, but more often than not, that is the case. In traditional societies this wisdom is highly prized and honored, but in the youth culture of the West it is too often ignored and wasted. If, as elders, we acquiesce in this and go quietly into our retirement homes and vegetate, we will be missing out on what could be one of the most exciting and fulfilling periods of our lives.To take full advantage of these years we need to be healthy and have a positive attitude. But as the author points out, conscious aging goes a step further. Conscious aging has a spiritual dimension in which the individual connects deeply to a sense of purpose and connection.

"There are a lot of books out there about manifestation and using the law of attraction, but this one stood out for me. It is positioned at the intersection of intuition, quantum physics and sacred geometry and is an integration of science and mysticism with a pretty savvy understanding of human psychology.Say you were to have a genie standing by to grant your dearest wish – would you know what to wish for? We hear many reports of people who won the lottery and ended up poor and miserable down the line because none of the things they bought with their money satisfied any lasting spiritual need. Deciding what it is you want to manifest is a complex task, and communicating that to the universe clearly requires you to be in integrity with your true self. The main reason we do not succeed in manifesting our desires is that too often our outer actions don't really align with who we are inside. As Maureen says, “Remember that having inner rules that don't agree with your outer actions is the single most damaging event that can occur inside your personal sphere.""When we call out to our personal genie, we need to know what we want and why. When you get clear on that, the book offers useful ways to narrow it down, and also practical tests to know if we are on the right track. The practices in the book were developed over many years and have been laid out in a very logical sequence, invoking scientific principles of resonance, sacred geometry and quantum theory. If you follow the procedure, as night follows day you should see the results you're looking for.Come on, rub the lamp – be a Genie! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain, not the least being clarity about what it is that you really want in life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B7ML161XUFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUMEGQU#wasThisHelpful","R3B7ML161XUFY","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having read many books and seen many films about pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago, I didn't expect to be as deeply engaged as I was. All of them have many themes in common, such as profound inner exploration, overcoming pain and physical challenges, bonding with other pilgrims and the profound effect of nature on the spirit, each story is as unique as the individual. Sonia Choquette's story was particularly riveting. I think it was due to her intensely candid and personal recounting of the recent upheavals in her life, including her analysis of the roots of her reactions going back to childhood. The candid observations and revelations, rare for a spiritual teacher of her stature, are written with gentle humor and deliver profound wisdom. A rewarding bonus are the eloquent verbal portraits she paints of all she encounters on her way.Reading this book is like stepping out of time and participating in the archetypal pilgrim's search for, and eventually achieving, connection with oneself and the divinity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAFWQM49AV78I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944515#wasThisHelpful","RAFWQM49AV78I","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book to be slowly savored. Mark Nepo is a master of the human condition, which he reflects back to us with deep compassion. Drawing from every hue of spiritual tradition, he paints our struggles, pain, and joy with vivid strokes. Going from micro to macro, from the fears and weaknesses of everyday life to the sweep of human consciousness at its grandest, most inclusive and unbounded, his verbal artistry is as compelling as his spiritual vision of universal humanity.He sees into our souls and reflects them to us as incubators of our magnificence and perfection. With the compassion of one who has suffered pain that brought him to the brink of eternity, he leads us gently to an acceptance of ourselves as we are, and an appreciation of the gifts we bring to the world. He urges us to life fully and not die with our songs unsung. He inspires us to transcend the limitations imposed on us by our fears – of failure, of being different, of being not enough. He poetic prose recounts tales of sages and sinners from many traditions and cultures, illuminating and anchoring one lesson after another.There are suggestions for reflection at the end of each chapter that make you want to sit back, close your eyes and just contemplate. This is a life-affirming guide to the soul’s awakening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5LUJZ20REBAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476774641#wasThisHelpful","R5LUJZ20REBAW","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When a former CIA spy and veteran intelligence officer talks about the shortcomings of the intelligence services, one tends to listen. The problem, Steele suggests, is that the clandestine services have tunnel vision, looking only at the data their operatives have collected, and ignoring the wealth of information from open sources freely available  in newspapers, public media, and the Internet. He points out, and actually proved when challenged to pit his skills against the combined spying agencies, that this open source information is far more able to provide what should be the core function of intelligence, namely, integrating information to support accurate decision-making.Steele is incredibly well read, and indeed is one of Amazon's top reviewers, covering 98 different categories of books. He has the ability to both analyze information and synthesize the pertinent points into recommendations for action. Having been frustrated by his inability to convince his superiors of the importance of the interrelationship and interdependency among politics, economics, and social welfare, and even more importantly of the importance of truth and integrity he resigned.The notion of open source is well known within the software community, where it has led to an amazing explosion of creativity and products that are on every computer and cell phone. He makes a strong case for expanding this notion of open source and transparency to every sphere of economic activity, arguing that this is the only way to revive a sense of trust of business, finance and government. While reading all the facts and statistics he presents tends to make one fibrillate with indignation, this book is essentially a call for something akin to the truth and reconciliation movement in South Africa post apartheid. This is a man with his feet firmly planted on the ground, even though his head and his heart embrace the world. He gives hopeful examples of initiatives like the open tool movement, where networks of farmers and engineers are building industrial machines with open specifications and interchangeable parts.The Open-Source Manifesto is a clarion call to open our eyes, our minds and our hearts to the possibilities inherent in unity and cooperation. Yes, it does seem to run counter to the greed and self-interest that seem to be ingrained in human nature, but Steele is optimistic that “we the people” will find the will and the means to accomplish the changes necessary to pull back from the brink of chaos and self-destruction. This includes acknowledging the real costs of continued exploitation and depletion of our commons – fresh water, clean air, energy, land – and building them into our economic models. Continuing business as usual does not seem to be a viable option, and the Open-Source Everything Manifesto is a valuable overview of the kinds of options we need to try, and the kind of greater-good-thinking we need to adopt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RA1JFF87DQQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MU3VKO#wasThisHelpful","R1RA1JFF87DQQU","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Hope Bryant observes that life is about aspiration and opportunity, but that without opportunity you lose hope; and the most dangerous person in the world is a person without hope. Although this observation focused on the poor and disenfranchised in America's inner cities and in rural America, the statements can equally apply around the world. We have become acutely aware of the enormous divide between the top10% of the world’s population that owns 86% of its wealth, and the almost 50% of the population living in poverty.  Poverty is not limited to one ethnic group nor to inner cities; it cuts across all demographics and there are more poor whites than any other group. We have begun to demand accountability from a financial and corporate system whose only objective is to generate more and more profits for the few, because this model is unsustainable, is already imploding and will only get worse.The cycle of poverty is enforced and perpetuated by a broken system where money and credit have fled to the suburbs, and loan sharks fill the vacuum; industry has decamped abroad and the only income options to escape the ghetto appear to young people to be sports, music, or dealing drugs. Positive role models and mentors are few and far between.On the bright side, Bryant points out that the intelligence and an entrepreneurial spirit that are now directed into gangs and criminal activities, are available to be channeled into positive directions. Having been a successful entrepreneur, he is on a mission to provide a framework to enable the poor to climb up the ladder to a sustainable middle class that is good for them and good for the country. He also points out that wealth is as much a subjective state of the spirit as it is a reflection of income. That is why giving people hope and dignity are the highest priorities.He has built an infrastructure of educational programs to teach financial literacy; brought branches of financial institutions back to the inner-cities to enable residents to rejoin the US economy; and he has provided crowd-funding forums wherein young people are exposed to entrepreneurial thinking and given access to mentors to support them in starting their own small businesses.One could argue that it takes a recognized leader and entrepreneur like Bryant to attract high profile partners and manifest such a structure for real change, and the many thousands of lives he has improved already are extremely encouraging. One can only hope, however, that the example he has provided will serve as a template and beta test for rolling out across the country, as he hopes. Hope is indeed his middle name.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLGUIEVZGXU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT486NY#wasThisHelpful","R1CLGUIEVZGXU7","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the account of the synchronicities and far out coincidences that let David Young to gradually and reluctantly accept that he wasn’t losing it and that George Harrison of the Beatles really did want to communicate to the world through him. David was originally a rock guitarist who then made a name for himself with relaxing instrumental music in which he plays two recorders in harmony at once. His musical background, combined with the fact that he is a longtime meditator and yoga practitioner, may have made him an ideal conduit for the energy that is still Harrison.The book is well-written and holds one’s attention, both for the interesting insights into the life of a musician on the road today and into the process of someone resisting, then accepting the possibility of communicating with a dead person. I suspect way many more people than actually admit to it have had unexplainable “coincidences” that they have tucked away because they don’t want people to think they are crazy. Consciousness as we know it is changing, and brave and candid people like David Young are helping it evolve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9V8W99L2CJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTT005M#wasThisHelpful","RN9V8W99L2CJC","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“The Money Nerve” is an empathetic look at the issues and situations that often trigger pain in our dealings with money issues.  The different aspects of Wheeler’s colorful background as a certified public accountant, a standup comedian, mountain climber, and lifelong meditator all feed into the grounded and insightful advice he offers with a light touch. The book looks at the attitudes towards ourselves and towards money that we’ve picked up from parents, peers, teachers, employers, and, of course, the media. He provides illuminating exercises to discover where we have negative thoughts that keep us from achieving financial freedom, and details practical action steps to move out of the situation. His advice is from a “been there, done that” perspective – never preachy and always empowering.This little book covers most of the little lies we tell ourselves, and could be a timely wake-up call for, oh, say 90% of us.

"I believe that this book represents an important watershed in medical thinking. The delusion referred to in the title is that good medical practice is about finding the right drug to treat the symptoms of any given disease. Dr. Bland, who is a proponent of functional medicine, suggests otherwise. His subversive platform is to find and treat the underlying causes of the chronic and debilitating diseases that are making life a lot less fun for a rapidly growing majority of the population. The explosive increase of cancers, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, autoimmune diseases and the like, has been blamed on the genetic lottery. It turns out however, that genes respond to their environment - internal and external. The growing science of epigenetics demonstrates that genes' expression can be turned ON AND OFF by environmental factors like stress, toxins, and nutrition (or lack of it.) The changes caused can even be passed down to subsequent generations. This is mind-blowing information, because it implies that by changing the environment of the body, you can change the susceptibility to these diseases.A very important point that he makes is that the causes of our chronic diseases are as individual as we are.  The “cures” need to be tailored to the particular circumstances of our life and physiology.  One only needs to listen to the side effects in the drug ads on TV to realize that taking them is like playing Russian roulette. Not surprisingly, nutrition is at the heart of his program. As Hippocrates said, “Let food be your medicine and medicine your food.” He has a 4R program to get one back on track: Remove - your specific allergens like gluten, dairy, shellfish, etc.; Replace – enzymes that have become insufficient; Reinoculate – the gut bacteria that have been killed off by antibiotics and toxins; Repair – with nutritional supplements. Detoxifying and de-stressing are also right up there.Bland provides self-assessment questionnaires to help you pinpoint your own areas of sensitivity and suggests protocols to address them. He also stresses the value of having the supervision of an enlightened medical practitioner, but the 80:20 rule probably works here as well. Anyone with the self-discipline to read and apply the principles in this book should reap major health benefits – both in terms of healing existing conditions and preventing more serious ones down the line.This is just a small taste of the gems in this comprehensive book. I can only hope that the solid science presented here will make its way into the conventional medical education curriculum. It might even help take general medicine back to its roots of “do no harm.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3HEKHBB35IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ37DEO#wasThisHelpful","R1T3HEKHBB35IV","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is eye-opening book gives one hope for the future of humanity - in both senses of the word. What if you could increase your income by 50% - what would that do for your lifestyle? Well that is the effect that the kind of products and services described in this book can have on the rural poor of the Global South. In many cases it is the difference between a bare and shaky subsistence and having enough to drink clean water, sufficient food and educate children.We need the kind of pioneering thinking the authors display here to shake up our preconceptions of what we can do for global poverty. The old adage of “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to fish and you feed him for life” is never more true than in this context. The authors make a strong business case for addressing the market opportunity presented by the billions of rural poor. It starts with walkabout research to understand the needs on the ground.  Then you need to create a plan that includes sourcing manpower and components locally, adapting technology to provide solutions that are affordable, contribute jobs, improve living standards and can be scaled up to provide a decent return on investment.It takes intelligence, commitment, hard work and perseverance, but the rewards could reach billions – both people and dollars, Not everyone will be comfortable with the scale the authors suggest, but the principles laid out are valid for just about any entrepreneurial undertaking.

"Piecing together references and documents studied over the course of fifteen years, Freddy Silva delivers a fresh understanding of the Knights Templar, what they were about, and the back-story of how and why they created a country. After reading the book, I can fully appreciate his fascination with this remarkable order of warrior knights and their spiritual brothers, the Cistercian monks.For lofty vision and pure hard work, the achievements of these two groups would put our 60’s Flower Children to shame. Indeed, I wonder if there are any echoes of their humanistic and spiritual vision around today that would come up to their ankles, let alone their shoulders.On the more esoteric level, Silva’s assumptions of what the Templars discovered during their excavations on Temple Mount in Jerusalem contribute to the intriguing idea that the bloodline of the Magdalene and Jesus continues to this day in the descendants of the Merovingian monarchs. My takeaway from the book, however, focused more on the legacy of the Templars in the enlightened nation-state they created, and down the centuries as it traced its way through the mystery schools and the Masons to the present day. Their example of community, service, equality, care for the earth and dedication to a higher spiritual truth, offer a stark contrast to the inner and outer conflicts generated today by materialism and religion.This book is built in layers and circles round to help you keep track of the players and historical context. It is not an easy read, but compelling and rewarding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4LVNHXE2ERE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3QND26#wasThisHelpful","R3J4LVNHXE2ERE","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know if this book will have universal appeal, but I loved it and couldn't put it down. Jan Reynolds is a prize-winning photojournalist and writer, a passionate adventurer from the Amazon to the Himalayas, and an amazing athlete. High Altitude Woman describes her adventures in some of the most dangerous and inhospitable environments at the roof of the world. She offers a fascinating perspective on the extreme physical fitness and endurance, as well as trust and dependence on others that are necessary to survive in such environments where, if your body, your judgment or your luck fail, you may pay with your life.I found particularly fascinating her descriptions of the life of the local guides and the native families she meets along the way. What was a highly challenging expedition for Jan and her team was everyday life for these people. Their hospitality, laughter and kindness amidst what we would consider extreme poverty put into perspective what is really important in life.Jan's mountaineering skill was such that she was invited to join all-male expeditions, yet she had to fight for that equality against male attitudes that seem to be hardwired to regard her as limited or inferior. She spends a lot of time in the book analyzing male and female attitudes and reactions, coming to the conclusion that we might all benefit from developing a kind of androgeny, combining the strength and drive of the male aspect with the sensitivity and empathy of the female aspect.Jan continually pushed herself to and beyond her physical limits. Competing with others and with the forces of nature seemed to make her feel alive. It would be interesting to know whether what drove her to excellence was simply a desire to be all she could be without limitation, or a hold-over from growing up on a farm with brothers and a deep need to be accepted as an equal by the guys. Whatever her motivation, her passion for life and her passionate advocacy for vanishing cultures and the natural world are truly inspiring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHW5WC8IVFHOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594774854#wasThisHelpful","RHW5WC8IVFHOT","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honest Medicine is a heroic work, bringing the meticulously documented story of four effective treatments to public awareness. It is such a sad commentary on the state of corporate medicine and healthcare that inexpensive treatments that can be lifesaving are suppressed because they will not generate enough revenue for their prescribers. Honest medicine is by no means a blanket condemnation of medical practice, but shows how it can fail patients and their families. This book is an important reminder to all healers of the necessity of keeping an open and curious mind, and of their oath to keep their patients from harm.Julia Schopick has selected for this book treatments that have been approved by the FDA, but were either forgotten or are being used in new ways. The case studies included here, where drugs have been layered one upon the other, each one dealing with the side effects or failures of the earlier attempt, demonstrate the blinkered approach of the doctors that has caused tragic suffering and enormous expense that could have largely been avoided.The incredibly good news is that there are now treatments for autoimmune diseases and even intractable cancers like pancreatic cancer, that are effective in a very high proportion of the cases, offering hope where once there was only the prospect of a downward slide to increasing disability and death. You would think this is the news that would be shouted from the rooftops by those whose pledge is to do no harm. Unfortunately it takes someone with the courage and the tenacity and the intelligence of the author to get this information out into the public.If anyone you know suffers from childhood epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, non-healing wounds, or pancreatic cancer, please have them listen to this interview and buy Julia's book. This gracious lady invites everyone needing more information to contact her directly. The book itself has a wealth of links and information so that anyone needing these therapies can find out where to go to get help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OHZ00WO15WCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982969007#wasThisHelpful","R1OHZ00WO15WCR","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"it's difficult to write about this book without getting a bit emotional. It is a joy to discover an individual with such deep compassion for the world and most especially for its children that he has dedicated his life to teaching. John Hunter has been nurturing young minds for over 35 years - leading them down the path of discovery not only of what the world is made of, but more importantly what they are made of. Through the medium of the World Peace Game that he developed, he invites children to discover the real complexity and intertwining relationships among the problems besetting humanity. By having them play through a multitude of different scenarios and problems he has put them on their mettle, not only to solve the world's crises but to make sure that the solution provides a benefit for all participants.John's story as a young peace activist in the 60s turned elementary school teacher is a very human one. What lifts it to another plane is the humility with which he undertakes his responsibility of molding character and teaching critical thinking. Never coming from the position of power or arrogance, he creates the space within which the children are able to discover the win-win solutions that will have a lasting influence on the person they become.It is a delight to read the stories of the individual children as they experience different facets of the game and of themselves. There is shy, stuttering Pablo, who suddenly rises to new heights as he ""gets"" it all, understands it all. There is the bully whose reign of arrogance is interrupted by a determined succession of tiny and timid defenders of truth and justice.While this is a story of pedagogy at its highest, most enlightened form, it is also a series of life lessons and re-affirmations of what is truly important in life that will hit home for every reader. It is only mildly astonishing that John Hunter and his children were invited several times to the Pentagon to meet with generals who questioned them in detail about how they would deal with various issues confronting the military.I'm not surprised that the book was turned into a movie nor that the movie and the book have catapulted John Hunter into the national limelight. I am so pleased that others have recognized the importance of what he is doing to exemplify the best in education, and have been sponsoring his evangelical talks and master classes across the country. He has so much wisdom, and shares it with such grace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFD9YPWKP1UFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547905599#wasThisHelpful","RFD9YPWKP1UFJ","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who appreciates the alternatives offered by natural medicine should read this book. It is the inspiring story of an extraordinary man, Dr. Ralph Weiss, who was one of the pioneers of natural medicine in the United States, as well as one of its most intelligent, dogged, and effective defenders. Dr. Weiss, now in his 90s, was active in his practice in Medford Oregon well into his 80s. He inspired generations of naturopathic physicians through his teaching, through his lectures at conferences, through his tenacious refusal to allow the FDA, the State Legislature and the medical establishment to deny his extraordinary care to his patients. Stephen Bailey became a close friend of this national treasure and has done us all a service by recording the rich life and legacy of Ralph Weiss.Dr. Bailey, a naturopath, was himself involved in the fight to protect the ability of naturopaths in Oregon and in the United States to diagnose, treat, prescribe and care for patients with the drugless regimen that is the foundation of naturopathy. Filled with fascinating anecdotes that reveal the caring and passionate devotion to his patients that was the hallmark of Dr. Weiss is practice, Dr. Bailey's eloquent book is a must-read for any therapist in the natural healing professions, as well as for anyone wanting to be inspired by the life of a man who found his calling in service to others and never wavered from that path.Interwoven with the personal story of Dr. Weiss, is the history of antagonism and outright thuggery of the medical establishment against anyone not compliant or complicit with their agenda of making prescription drugs the cornerstone of healthcare in America. As such it is a cautionary tale for all of us who value our freedom to choose what we feel is best for our well-being. At the time of this writing there are bills in Congress that would limit our choice of supplements, indeed our access to non-toxic, natural alternatives to potentially crippling drugs with their myriad side effects. As George Santayana said, `Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.""This book is inspiring, intelligent, richly informative and beautifully written. I recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LS4RVTC8PU8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0757003826#wasThisHelpful","R1LS4RVTC8PU8S","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If George and Sedena Cappannelli are an example of what social and spiritual awakening among the over-50 set can look like, there's hope for this old world yet. Rather than seeing the years after 50 as a time of decline, they argue that these years can be embraced as a time of harvest of accumulated wisdom and an opportunity for redesigning and replanting one's garden for the second half of life. The suggestions they give are not a one-size-fits-all, and I think were intended to be more indicative than prescriptive.I suppose for those of us who missed out on the psychedelic scene, suggesting drugs today as a way to loosen up one's spirituality can be a bit off-putting, but it is a small annoyance and doesn't detract from the importance of their main message, which is calling on pre- and post-boomers to wake up to their power and responsibility to demand and embody change. Their book is part inspirational workbook, part sociopolitical education, and part revolutionary manifesto.  Let's hope for all our sakes, that it is also a harbinger of a real awakening to action by a demographic that has the time, resources and guts to lobby for change, and the wisdom to envision solutions that work for all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RH3LMETRSPTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401942490#wasThisHelpful","R3RH3LMETRSPTW","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to think of the spiritual teacher who doesn't recommend the practice of meditation. Its benefits are many, ranging from medically proven reduction of stress to enhancing one's creativity and effectiveness in daily life. If you have ever tried to meditate and given up because you found yourself fidgeting and thinking of a thousand and one things, this book, Effortless Mind, lets you put the guilt behind you and learn to meditate with ease.Borys studied meditation around the world, including time spent with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as well as with Amma, the hugging saint, with whom he worked for years, and even taught meditation at her gatherings.  It's not surprising that he picked up a trick or two about meditation for the masses. What I like about his approach is that he starts gently with easily understood visualization techniques, and then goes on to add new layers of practice as you gain experience.You don't need to sit on a futon for hours - Ajayan suggests twenty minutes a day, but even five minutes is useful.  The visualizations in the book are easy to follow, and you can find a link on Ajayan's website to download the audio of a guided visualization. If you've been thinking that you really should meditate but have been putting it off, this may be the book for you.  In this busy world wouldn't we all benefit from carving out a bit of time for nurturing our inner selves?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TJEK6KTMXWDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608681548#wasThisHelpful","R1TJEK6KTMXWDK","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I admit it - I love words, and am always fascinated by where they came from.  I enjoy words you can roll around in your mouth like Demosthenes' marbles, and I'm a sucker for obscure etymology. In all these respects, Phil Cousineau's book is deliciously satisfying, but you also get a delightful bonus. The descriptions accompanying his eclectic selections, putting the words in context, are like a stream-of-consciousness memoir cum trivia treasure trove. It's a great book for cuddling up with or for sitting on the ""throne.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MT63TBTJOJS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936740176#wasThisHelpful","R3MT63TBTJOJS4","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Visions of heaven and dialogues with beings in other dimensions used to be considered the realm of mystics or psychotics; but when eminent doctors, scientists, businessmen, astronauts and people from every walk of life brave ridicule to tell their stories, even the most confirmed skeptic may start to suspect something real is happening. JD Messinger is aptly named, for his messages about our essential nature as beings of light and manifestors of the physical world around us are carefully and scientifically reasoned. Armed with credentials that stretch from Annapolis to boardrooms and halls of power around the world, Messinger describes the intellectual, physical and emotional journey that led to his spiritual awakening.His book is a collection of profound and often amusing dialogues with an unseen being that ""wrote itself"" during eleven days in May. An unusual person by any yardstick, his inquiring mind asked the most challenging questions about the nature of reality, like what is death and what is the purpose of our lives; what is God and how is the physical world brought into existence; how the world of light generates and envelops the world of form. The answers are coherent and never superficial, provoking a lot of reflection on the part of the reader. It is intensely satisfying when you can add another insight to the mosaic of your own understanding of the universe, and this book is full of them.I was reminded of the scene from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" where Indy's faith is tested as he prepares to step out over a chasm. It is a leap of faith for most of us to believe in a Creator and trust that there is a purpose in our lives. Books like ""11 Days in May"" are like the sand that Indy threw out over the path to outline the steppingstones across the fearsome void.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCH7MD77A8BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933754931#wasThisHelpful","RHCH7MD77A8BB","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author writes movingly of her personal journey inspired by her mentor, Alberto Aguas, an extraordinary Brazilian healer who taught a powerful healing method he developed that incorporated the indigenous wisdom of the Guaranì shamans of the Amazonian rainforest.  Aguas was a natural healer since childhood, but was profoundly influenced by the ancient traditions of the Guaranì that had a joyful and direct connection to the God source simply through love.Aguas lived with them in the rainforest for extended periods, and was jailed and tortured by the Brazilian authorities for protesting the eviction of the Guaranì from their land so it could be exploited. Although this severely impacted his health, he continued to teach the healing method he called Ama-Deus, the love of God, around the world.Beth Cosmos assumed the responsibility of carrying on Alberto's work, and this book conveys the spirit of it, if not the details. Alberto felt strongly that it should be passed on through person-to-person transmission. Beth goes on to describe ""infiltrating"" this form of energy healing into mainstream hospitals, and the often ambivalent responses of the doctors who didn't want to know what she was doing, but asked her to keep on doing it.The narrative is punctuated with interesting fictional vignettes of the life of the ancient shamans, that add color and a deeper understanding of the background from which Ama-Deus was birthed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VD0O1DFJ5TX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477146393#wasThisHelpful","R3VD0O1DFJ5TX6","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With divorce at all time highs and civility in politics at all time lows, I don't know what is more dispiriting - the alienating effect of high conflict on children or on voters. The parallels that the authors draw are striking and speak to the heart of a deep malaise in our society.War-like language permeates every aspect of our lives and raises the anxiety level of the whole populace. It is no wonder that there are more handguns in the US than there are people! Candidates keep the pot simmering so they can come across as the hero who can save the day.When listening to political discourse and media coverage, identifying narcissistic and high conflict behavior is not that difficult. Eddy and Saposnek suggest two litmus tests. Ask yourself, 1) ""Is this really a crisis?"" and 2) ""Is this really a hero?""While one can justifiably point a finger at the other side, irrespective of one's politics, that's not going to help turn the situation around. What will help is discernment. Stirring up fear and suspicion keeps media viewers and campaign contributors coming back, and if it also generates anger and hatred, well, that's show biz. It is up to us to buy into it or not. It is up to us as voters to demand honesty and civility of those we vote into office.The authors offer some suggestions on how to reframe the debate using EAR - statements that reflect Empathy, Attention and Respect - and BIFF - responses that are Brief, Informative, Friendly and Firm.  They call on politicians and media to return to self-imposed limits on high conflict rhetoric, and for a return of campaign disclosure laws. They point out that the Citizens United ruling of 2010 that led to the formation of Super PACs destroyed all vestiges of accountability and restraint in political advertising.Are the authors confident of the future? Not really. They suggest it will get worse before it gets better, but at least by articulating the problem in this way, we might be more inspired to be the change we want to see and demand change in our institutions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVEC9GL7KO4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936268523#wasThisHelpful","REVEC9GL7KO4X","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hollywood could not have scripted a more plausible or powerful scenario to demonstrate the existence of heaven and the afterlife than the experience of Dr. Eben Alexander. A top neurosurgeon whose whole career was focused on the brain as the seat of consciousness, he got bacterial meningitis with no history of exposure. It was such a virulent form that it put him into a coma and stopped all his higher brain functions. According to current medical understanding, he could not have been thinking or even dreaming and should have died, yet he returns to life bursting with joy at having met God.Having been in a deep coma for six days his doctors expected him to be a vegetable should he even survive, yet he regained his full memory and faculties. Not surprisingly, the experience forever changed his understanding of consciousness and of our place in the universe. He tried every possible medical, physiological and biochemical alternative to explain his experience, yet each one was discounted in turn, leaving only the mystery.I am reminded of the TV ad with the cell phone testers asking, ""Can you hear me now?""As a radio host and reviewer I have received a surprisingly large number of books describing near death experiences, each one offering similar or complementary insights about the nature of death and divinity. One of the reasons this book stands out is that Dr. Alexander's credentials are unassailable, the case was impeccably documented, and he was a skeptic with no ax to grind for a divine or metaphysical explanation. We are also given enough of the scientific details to understand what a miracle this truly was.The book is beautifully written, and deftly interweaves his personal story with the drama of his illness, recovery and attempts to understand what happened. The lyrical description and the ineffable beauty of what he experienced ""on the other side"" will touch you deeply. ""Proof of Heaven"" makes your heart sing as you recognize the truth of our eternal connection to Source.

"Jack Rourke's approach to explaining psychic phenomena reminds me of the story of The Three Bears - not too woo-woo, not too skeptical, but just right. His own story has elements in common with many stories I have heard before: a stressful childhood; ability to ""know"" things before they happen; suppressing his abilities because they were not ""normal;"" and then finally accepting one's gifts and using them to help others.  His gifts, I might add, are impressive and the case studies he relates are very convincing. It is not surprising that he is in demand as a consultant to the entertainment industry.His book provides helpful criteria for making the distinction between true psychics, able to provide objectively verifiable readings, and the often well-meaning but unverifiable statements and prognostications of others who may be highly empathic, but are probably using a vivid imagination combined with good people-reading skills.I appreciated the methodical way he explains the different forms of extraordinary perception, the scientific basis for how they probably work, and how to develop and enhance your own skills. He provides a synthesis of his decades of research into psychology, neuroscience and physics to ground his explanations of paranormal phenomena and help the reader distinguish between the hype and true mystery. His stated aim is to show the way to safe and meaningful personal and spiritual development, and his own work is an inspiration in that regard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13XGGOQ3F51ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604078049#wasThisHelpful","R13XGGOQ3F51ZJ","A2V50DGRYD3TQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V50DGRYD3TQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is alternately depressing, infuriating and inspiring. It is the exhaustively documented story of a clinical trial of a promising enzymatic therapy for treating highly lethal pancreatic cancer. The trial compared a treatment Dr. Gonzalez had been using with major success in his private practice against a chemotherapeutic agent, Gemzar.The trial was so mismanaged and stacked against Dr. Gonzalez's protocol that after more than 10 years of futile struggle, this promising approach has been kept out of the mainstream oncological arsenal. While Dr. Gonzalez may have written this book to set the record straight about the chain of events, and it gives way more detailed information than anyone but a lawyer would want to read, it's real importance is in highlighting the unholy and incestuous alliance between Big Pharma and the governmental institutions charged with funding medical research that continues unabated.This is tragically a story that has been repeated over and over since the early 1900's, and because it is so unthinkable that our own government and academics would pervert the research process to protect monied interests, we passively allow this to continue. Dr. Gonzalez ends his book with an angry appeal to true researchers to stay away from tainted funds and to preserve their integrity for the good of mankind. He himself continues to use his protocol and save patients every day.

"Didn't expect to but I really did like this movie best of all it isn't the usual run of the mill zombie movie with blood and guts everywhere there is minimal gore which I find to be a refreshing changePlot1 The dillweed twins I call them number 1 digs a whole finds a meteor tells dillweed number 2 to get the wheelbarrow so he goes and fetches it. When number 2 returns they wheel it into town and set it on the ground, but wait it gets better Dingus McStupid hits it with a pickax releasing a zillion spores infecting everyone. NOTE hey idiots dig a whole find green glowing thing swiftly recover it and run like hell, Duh2 Handsome Rick Mora plays the young Indian warrior falsely accused of the rape and murder of a white woman whose father sent a bounty hunter after him, There is an interesting revelation made later on when he and the bounty hunter one day sit down and talk sharing history3 The bounty hunter who was sent to track down and capture the Indian man arrives in town leaves his horse with an older guy to take care of. He then sets out to track his prey, he also has a tale of his own to tell4 The beautiful blond girl in distress is rescued from a man trying to sell her by the bounty hunter and taken away, they end up traveling together. Later on they meet up with the Indian warrior who bounty hunter learns the truth5 As they say the crap hits the fan when the freaking zombies start popping up.

"--------------------------Spoiler Alert, Be Warned This Is A Review/Spoiler Ahead-----------------------Animal lovers beware because this'll rile ya like it did me big time. My problems and issues with this movie, lets begin1 Sarah a girl deeply in debt consolidates her bills goes to live with her kind elderly uncle Steven. Homicidal psychopath bill collector guy comes to hassle her demanding $8000 up front gets physical her friend slugs him, he swears revenge. Later Sarah goes out he breaks in kills her friend. A while after that he goes back again picks the lock steals money and get ready for this MICROWAVES her cat to death, Ahhhhhhh OMG2 Wacko debt collection company dude has a stunning blond girlfriend Samantha who he's been beating and who is also in a debt consolidation agreement. His co worker a nice guy who happens to be in love with her not knowing what will happen puts her case file on his desk. Psycho looks throws a 2 second tantrum goes home with Asian food refills her wine glass puts poison in it while the poor girls dying he rants about her debt how she I guess he thinks did not pay enough, he shoves a rose in the gasping for air woman's mouth clamps his hand over it till she's gone. He tells others she committed suicide but the cops know better3 Sarah is so distraught over the loss of her cat and friends death accidentally overdoses on pain killers in the hospital room unconscious after being saved. Demented debt collector dude you guessed it ta da shows up gee how surprising, not, however his plans are thwarted when he arrives there's a guy there the undertaker posing as Sarah's uncle then the doctor comes in so after yapping he leaves. Later on yawn nut job comes back again snaps the gold chain off Sarah's neck says you better pay up ????? then with a stamper stamps past due on her forehead and leaves4 Next he goes to a strip joint his next victim an in debt stripper bartender she takes him to the back room offers him a little take it out on trade deal, he beats and chokes her. While on the floor he reaches in her bra top and takes her money and leaves clipboard in hand5 Homicidal maniac number 2 yup cuz ya know ones never enough the town undertaker who's committed a few of his on murders over the years, he has an obsession with Sarah. He breaks into Sarah's house with a needle injects something into her uncle Steven's neck calls his assistant saying Steven died pick up then cremate the body. Sarah is injected with something and tied to the bed. Now killer number 1 has arrived debt collector armed with a knife tells Sarah pay up and I'll let you go, he tells her that her husband didn't kill himself with car carbon monoxide but it was he himself who set it up to kill him. Her dead husband does get even so that's a plus6 The female cop character oh my god she is nothing but an arrogant accusing mean irritating pain in the ??? who only seems more interested in bullying than facts and catching actual guilty parties. When Sarah's friend got murdered she accused Sarah of doing it though Sarah was across town. Then when Sarah told her about the undertaker also being there the cop says she's so drugged up she hallucinatedHow it endsSarah is telling a woman how the undertaker fixed it so and told the cops that Sarah had called set up the funeral with him and he got the paper signed by the doctor and created a great fake alibi. After visiting the cemetery Sarah goes home while laying on her bed reading she screams when she sees someone Undertaker who shoves a needle in her neck killing her with an injection. This garbage shouldn't even be categorized as a horror paranormal movie it is more of a serial killer movie than a paranormal investigation storyI gotta give props my favs and actorsDebt collector- The dude who played the psycho debt collector I love that actor man he looked the part perfectly and played the hell out of it his facial expressions everything very scary. Uncle Steven- This guy is a sweetheart lovable character. Sarah- This actress is awesome.

"OMG what the hell was I thinking? This annoying thing is mislabeled it should be called Legend Of The Flashbacks because all through the bloody movie the reaper chick has so many flashbacks it is enough to drive you insane, so many they could have made a separate story with them. EXAMPLE in the middle of a fight scene it's getting good you guessed it flashback, it ends she's standing there in dream land, really? You'd be sliced in two before you came back to reality DUH, I mean come on people when you write this stuff don't you realize this is overkill?The idea was good but it fizzled for one thing a demon has the strength of 100 men at least and is pretty much unbeatable, so a half demon would be able to easily take down a few of us weaker humans, she is easily overtaken even when practicing. If a little more of that had of been added to her character it would have been beneficial and more realistic, instead she seems more weak in battle when in reality she'd effortlessly out do humans by a mile.

Then on the table for the abortion I can't do this she says. Theo puts his ear to her belly he hears something the baby they argue when she denies she's pregnant then tells him she aborted it, Later on in the shower they begin to make love as usual she stops him Mad Theo stomps out, outside he hears a scream runs back in she sliced her wrist with a razor................................................................................SPOILER ALERT AND MOVIE ENDING.............................................................................Little miss hallucinating is in the hospital after slitting her wrists, while she's asleep sitting in a chair next to her bed sleeping loving husband  Theo sits holding her hand.

"June 20 2015 Update and changed my review and knocked 4 stars off reasons belowFirst I want to say I don;t blame the seller,it is the manufacturers fault for the following. There is no freaking way this crap is even 99% pure as marked. Do not try to make soap with this I just tried I am experienced at it and here's what happened. 1 I bought new oil mixed the lye solution as usual it mixed with the oil then mere seconds after separated this is not normal, I said okay maybe it's the oil. 2 Tried again with a different oil same thing. 3 I tried a third time with another oil same results that is when I knew for sure it wasn't the oilsI have many years experience with lye so I decided to do a little test I took a spoonful and mixed it with cool water now everyone familiar with lye knows the lye makes even cold water boiling hot this only got really warm, I thought uh hah. I decided to do a different kind of test I mixed 4 times the normal amount of lye and added it to first batch that worked, it was originally going to be body soap but after so much of this crap being used I made laundry soap out of it instead it worked for thatFragments/floaters- The other reviewer is right when mixed with a light colored oilI saw a lot of blackish colored floaters the little buggers reminded me of metal fragments. This'll be decent for cleaning floors etc not much else so it won't be a total waste. SHIPPED, It comes in a plastic ziploc bag same kind used for food, that is wrapped in paper, then put inside a mailing envelope. If you want really good lye 1 Rooto Corp, 2 Comstar, and 3 Essential Depot are all excellent and work great","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NCQHYLG1WCBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3RDAIM#wasThisHelpful","R2NCQHYLG1WCBE","A1F958T2GSWCEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F958T2GSWCEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the love of god run for your lives hide your kids and do not even think about wasting your precious time on this so bad it wouldn't make good lawn fertilizer crap bomb. Don't be fooled by the cool cover art like I was the devil baby pictured on the cover is scarier then the movie sadly you will see nothing like that in the film.

An egg hatches the so called devil baby emerges. Dear lord and that clawing your nerves annoying cry it makes to often and way to long throughout the movie I wanted to reach into the TV and kill it myself.

"Sniff ahhh heaven, I love this stuff it smells like a grove of fresh oranges. Quickly removes grease, odors, stains, dirt from cloths, floors and leaves the heavenly scent of fresh oranges. It can also be added to laundry being washed with bleach, I make my version of orange Windex  put some in a spray bottle with water and a little ammonia works great. It also works great for washing walls, bathroom tile, it keeps my wood kitchen cabinets looking newOther uses1 Paint Remover- I ran out of paint remover for oil based paint so I mixed some of this with regular cooking oil in a large jar set the brushes inside and left it sit and ta da it stripped the brushes. I spilled oil paint on the floor the Citrasolve quickly dissolved it allowing me to easily wipe it up2 Label Remover- When used straight from the bottle without being mixed with anything it is wonderful for removing stubborn labels from jars bottles etc, I dampen the label first.3 Chewing Gum-  It works on chewing gum stuck on your shoe4 Dish Washing Soap- When I really want to use dish washing soap with an added boost I add some of this","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLJDM97C3XF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GMTW2W#wasThisHelpful","R2RLJDM97C3XF0","A1F958T2GSWCEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F958T2GSWCEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a great find I am so happy right now this is one of my favorite things so I got the 1 lb bag it is well packaged the zip resealable bag is heavy so I do not worry there, you can always put it in a jar if you like. I passed my taste taste, yep I know freaky hah? But I am a tartness freakUses1 One time I ran out of lemon juice and really wanted a lemonade so I improvised I dissolved about 1 8th teaspoon of the powder in water with a few drops of lemon oil for flavor this powder gives it the tanginess real lemon juice has. Add ice stir and your in business2 Greasy messes this stuff is my kicking greases butt best bud, mixed with liquid dish soap this zaps the hell out of the nasty grease making cleanup way faster and easier3 Laundry sometimes when we sadly have that frickin doesn't want to leave it's comfy new home aka your clothes hard to remove grime I mix 1 tablespoon of this with laundry soap for 1 load of laundry this gives the soap an extra boost and in most cases doubles the cleaning effect4 As others said yup it also removes rust5 I make soap and once in a while the color is lousy but a few pinches of this I found lightens it, but you should know depending on the amount used it also causes thickening6 Excellent skin cleanser especially for oily skin when mixed with soap and used as a facial wash, in baths and showers, and best of all it is all natural.

"Epic I love this stuff made my over 20 year old steel sink shine like new, the copper on my old copper bottom pots looks like a shiny new penny, I have tried it on aluminum and it works very well, for heavy messes on ceramic pans I have found a light scrubbing with this works great, it a does an excellent job cleaning silver and steel jewelry. My musician friend uses it to clean his trumpet it looks beautiful and new afterward. This stuff is a life saver with kitchen counter tops, bathtubs, enamel sinks, it also helps if after an accident on a white floor tile and the only way to remove it is scrubbing it this will not bleach like cleansers do.

"Nicely put together story that is a unique mix of science fiction, supernatural horror drama and mystery. A group of scientists are conducting experiments with a serum bringing patients back from the dead and start off with a dog Rocky he has severe cataracts on both eyes after he is revived their are changes among other things he's no longer blind. Zoe one of the scientists is accidentally electrocuted her fiance desperate to save her brings her back with the same procedure with horrific results.Like the dog Zoe is successfully brought back and changed but in a far worse and more deadly way, it seems it not only revives the dead but also reaches into other places not only the dark side of the human mind but also into the spiritual realm evil. The other scientists learn this the hard way as Zoe's new abilities slowly manifest then strange frightening and inexplicable things begin to take place. I really enjoyed this science fiction/horror, the supernatural, horror, and science fiction being 3 of my favorite categories and this film being made of all three drew me and I am so glad I gave it a chance. The ending is oh my God I did not expect that what a great plot twist and grand finale","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QL6ZK7IEQNFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUK505O#wasThisHelpful","R1QL6ZK7IEQNFF","A1F958T2GSWCEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F958T2GSWCEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After their neighbors a husband and wife are murdered and they are attacked the same night by the same murderers a young married couple move putting Annabelle in the trash before leaving. In their new apartment while unpacking the wife finds Annabelle/devil dolly in one of the boxesAnnabelle is like a mild but still deadly version of Chucky from Child's Play influencing people and causing strange as well as deadly occurance's to take place.

"Dark, deranged, twisted and sick and I loved every freaking moment of it. These people are the strangest on earth they do things to each other you would never believe. It begins with an attractive couple a psychiatrist his wife and teenage daughter moving into a beautiful old house with a dark history. Their first day there they meet their next door neighbor played byJessica Lange who comes looking for her autistic daughter who has a creepy uncanny knack for getting into the houseAfter settling in slowly bizzar things begin to happen and as the story goes on the history of the houses previous owners through the years is discovered shocking things a murder among other things. The first owner was a doctor who built the house for his wife and the path he chose to follow is indeed horrific and beyond imagining ,The new owners are trying to start over after the loss of their unborn child, he has a strange assortment of psychiatric patients one is a charming kind hearted teenage boy with a creepy connection to the old house. Later on the wife finds out she is pregnant and the couple is ecstatic about it and happily start preparing for the new arrivalAs hidden secrets are brought to light the young doctors dark secret comes out. Then there is a guy dressed in one of those black rubber S&M outfits with a ski mask like hood on it sneaking around their home scaring others and later on does that lead to a mind blowing surprise. Jessica Lange's character also has a connection to house and was involved in something tragic that took place in the past. I don't want to give anything away and spoil it for others but this is an amazing series, I thought after season 1 this could not possibly get any scarier but season 2 and 3 are proved me wrong and even darker than season 1. Season 4 is really creepy I rented episode 1 of it and it is really good, American Horror story just keeps getting better and better.

There are the 2 sisters sharing one body with 2 heads played by Sarah Paulson oh my god the special effects are scary amazing she really looks like she has two heads.

"Super awesome with magnificent results. I just painted an old patio set that I'm using as a kitchen table it was originally black and pretty beat up with rust spots to. After painting them with the Rust-Oleum Aluminum they look so beautiful very silver and new like they just came out of the store. I also tried something I've never done before I took my all black computer keyboard put paper tape around all of the buttons and painted the frame around them and just like I wanted the buttons stand out against the silver. I couldn't find a black and silver keyboard in the store so I did this smiles.TipsFor people who've never used this before 1 while painting keep something in the can to stir the paint with I used an old spoon and stir every now and then because with metallic paint after a while the metallic part settles down to the bottom of the can, and if not done after a while you will begin to notice that when applying paint it suddenly begins to look dark. 2  Do not overload the brush, roller, or foam pad heavily because though on the thin side even a smaller amount covers a lot, and if applied to heavily it looks bad and uneven and you don't get the smoothness that looks so good.

"Very nice, when I opened the pouch for the first time the scent reminded me of Tamarind ,the flavor is light and mild and after a few seconds I noticed it leaves a slight coffee taste in your mouth, if you prefer more of a coffee taste you could probably add a spoonful of instant coffee to it, after being poured in appearance it reminds me of green tea, the powder is light tan. I use 1 teaspoon to about one and a half cups of boiling water I turn the heat off cover it and steep it like tea for about 10 minutes, I like to drink it powder and all so I don't strain it through a filter. Best of all it doesn't have a ton of caffeine like regular coffee.. This is 100% pure green coffee powder there are no additives in itThe company is excellent fast shipping I quickly received my order, it was well packed and cushioned to prevent damage and there was no damage. I will definitely be buying more from them in the future. To be honest this was not an actual purchase the company asked me to give an unbiased review of one of their products and in exchange I could pick something I wanted so I chose this coffee, I reviewed something I already had experience with Stevia powder a sweetener made from the Stevia plant, I have however bought their Vitamin C powder and it is wonderful pure with no additives","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2LTCKYW6GLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBHHARI#wasThisHelpful","R2L2LTCKYW6GLD","A1F958T2GSWCEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F958T2GSWCEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes it is suave stylish great characters drop dead gorgeous guys, the imagery and artwork are beautiful and I love  the idea. A nice meek pretty young girl is sent to stay with a group of male vampires I thought this is so cool a human girl sent to live with a house full of  hot male vamps this is gonna be great. But here's the deal breaker for me she is treated like garbage abused verbally and physically I mean come on she's like a blood bank on legs their feeding on her hello at least show some friggin kindnessI kept watching thinking okay maybe things will get better attitudes will change once they warm up to her and they'll bond and be like a family nope didn't happen, I have only one regret that she could have somehow became more powerful than them and give them a taste of the hell they put her through.

"I am definitely going to be buying from this company again.

I used the same mix in the shower makes an excellent body cleanser as well. I know this is weird I used it like toothpaste it stripped the plaque right off, I wouldn't do it all the time because of the acidHair dye removerHoly crap it actually works, I was told mixing vitamin C with shampoo removes hair dye I tried an experiment after cutting my hair I made a swatch mixed equal amounts of the vitamin powder with shampoo made a mix with the same thickness as hair conditioner. I coated the swatch with it put it in a plastic cap covered and left it sit for a while. about half an hour later I came back and it had removed a good amount of the dye. It will not remove heavy layers of dye with one time but it removes a decent amount, NOTE it does dry hair out but conditioner fixes that.

"I read 6 books in this series in a few days, while on vacation. Although it's not among the best urban fantasy series (for those, see Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Mark Henwick), it was good enough to read multiple books. There's little world building, the characters tend to be simplistic, and the main character is a Mary Sue, but Connie Suttle does give us a slightly different take on vampires, and plot lines aren't utterly predictable. But this one jumped the shark. Suttle has run out of steam, so does she end the series? Oh no, she folds time and jumps 300 years into the future so she can abandon all ""rules"" of behavior and physics. Figures' personalities change radically (still one-dimensional, but now a different dimension), their relationships explode in all directions, and new powers are piled on, seemingly at random. And the series continues for more books, but I'm done. It's just silly now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PODO8GDJ6U03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LQB1I2#wasThisHelpful","R2PODO8GDJ6U03","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how the Ilona Andrews team does it.  Here we are at the 8th book in the series, and characters and plots are still interesting. We know the personalities now (and for anyone who hasn't read the other books DON'T START HERE), but they're in no way stale. They act consistently with what we know about them - I hate it when authors switch personalities on characters because they're written out - but they're still engaging, and the plot has done an excellent job of evolving over the series.  I love the humor, and the action is sufficiently described without descending into absolute gore.

"Such a tiresome book. It's basically a fairy tale with paranormal elements: we're in some undefined place and time, though there's no modern technology, so presumably it's some ""past"" universe. There's very little world building, as the author concentrates on the characters, though she gives us nothing but sketchy outlines of their personalities.  Melzer can't write convincing dialogue or action and spends most of her time going around and around in her characters' heads. That might not be the worst thing if the characters had any interesting thoughts, but they don't. They're simple, even childlike, in their responses, and the reader feels stuck in quicksand, sinking fast into boredom.The writing doesn't help - it's repetitive and drawn out, without humor, compelling observations, depth of feeling, or imaginative elements.

Urban fantasy doesn't often give us an elf as a main character - and her elfinness needs significant fleshing out - but Suto has written a pretty good book here. There are too many ""deus ex machina"" moments, and the main character is trying to do things too much on her own, without any knowledge or experience to back her up (why didn't  she go to the wolves the minute the master vampire threatened her werewolf best buddies, rather than caving to his blackmail?), but there's definitely potential for some interesting developments that would support a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32U3LYTBIMVIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNWFPF0#wasThisHelpful","R32U3LYTBIMVIE","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a big disappointment after the first book in the series. The first third narrates the same events as the first book, from the perspective of the male lead, rather than the female lead. Which would be ok if it added anything to the story, but it really doesn't. We do learn Bal's thoughts & feelings, but it turns out the big silent werewolf actually has the emotional development of an 11-year-old, so this hardly advances readers' interest in the story. Beyond that, the writing is significantly worse.  Mells needs a good editor in the worst way. She cuts and pastes pages of dialogue from the first book right into this one; she hasn't got a clue how to develop Bal's character (his reactions to Pierce are childish: when Pierce demonstrated her telekinetic powers - powers he had seen another person display before - he ""wanted to jump up in amazement - but the need to play it cool and collected won out""); and technical writing problems abound (""you maybe feel some sort of strange solidarity with her, maybe?"").Pierce's 1st-person narration returns after the initial (long) slow start, and the pace picks up, but it begins to become predictible. Repeated quirks in place of character growth and a typical kind of snarkiness in the humor get a little stale. While I didn't feel it in the first book, this one reads very much as YA lit, which for me is normally too callow to be interesting.Maybe she just had one book in her, maybe? But if she has so little story to tell, why write a series instead of a stand alone?","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KNPGTJ9XL9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXR1XFC#wasThisHelpful","R17KNPGTJ9XL9J","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There's no world building, as it all takes place in our world, but aspects of the paranormal start to unfold as Pierce begins to understand them.  There's perhaps a bit too much description for my taste - it feels as if the plot bogs down in places - and the author consistently misuses the pronoun ""I"" (e.g., ""he took Mia and I by the hand""), which is one of my pet peeves.  (Would anyone ever say ""he took I by the hand""? Then why would anyone think taking ""Mia and I"" is right?), but on the whole the writing is pretty good.

These enchanting petals fill the air with scents of iris and bay leaves as cassis bud, rosewood, and white patchouli provide a soothing and natural finish."" It's definitely a lot of patchouli, sort of like the perfume old ladies wear in church that makes you feel unpleasantly dizzy. And it's baby pink.

It's well written from a technical point of view, but there's nothing special that stands out about it. Does the H have a tortured past? Check. Do all males seem to want her? Check. Can she solve crimes that send regular authorities into meltdown? Check.

And by the way, if you know any 19-year-olds, ask them what color periwinkle is; and ask them to identify a Beethoven string quartet in an elevator; and ask them to explain Indonesian mythology. I don't read urban fantasy for its realism, but I do expect the characters to be believable, and Addison just doesn't cut it.So if you like adult rather than YA fiction, it'll be hard to relate. I wish YA books would all be plainly labelled; after working with teens all week, I really don't want to read about them in my spare time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AWYSKRVD4QG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1489553320#wasThisHelpful","R3AWYSKRVD4QG3","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems to be a fine product, but it came with the most confusing instructions I've ever encountered (and I've assembled a lot of Ikea furniture, so I'm no stranger to confusion). It's a 12"" x 1.5"" Velcro strap that's intended to wrap around power cords. How could this be confusing, you ask? Well it has 2 slits in it, and apparently you're supposed to: ""Thread one end [of what?] through slit. Thread other end [of what?] through slit of cord [do your cords have slits?]. Plug cord together. Pull ends of strap around plug [?????] tightly."" Oy.There are pictures but Amazon put a UPC sticker across them, so I was still lost. On the other hand, wrapping a Velcro strip around a coiled power cord isn't exactly rocket science, either. I'm just not sure you need this particular product to do that. It's a bit bulky, so it's not something you'd want to use, say, for the cord of your cell phone - it seems to be intended for something like an industrial extension cord. Although if you followed the instructions, you'd have to unthread your extension cord before you could use it.

"If you've read many regency romances, this book is as familiar as the back of your hand:  the rich, stuck-up, but ultimately unhappy h; the unconventional, ""adorable"" H who shakes him out of his hide-bound ways and brings him to a satisfying love-filled life; the social conventions that try to pull them apart; and the villain who attempts to get the H for his own.  Gah. You've encountered every character trait and plot point a thousand times before.What would have saved the book would have been amusing writing or clever observations (see, for example, Loretta Chase or Eloisa James). But Fenton's prose, while certainly workmanlike, is anachronistic, and her humor tends towards the slapstick. The story goes on too long, the characters are too flat, and the plot is too overdone (everything in there but the kitchen sink) to make for enjoyable reading for an experienced reader.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8V4NP9F65KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORBNER4#wasThisHelpful","R2E8V4NP9F65KM","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But as an air purifier it seems pretty good  - it diminishes odors in a noticeable way, so I'm assuming it filters other particles as well. There's a HEPA filter (which must be replaced approximately every 3 months - more cost) and a pre-filter that can be rinsed out and re-used.

"I normally love books where the H & H come from really different life styles, but this book has limited characterizations and basically no plot. The whole story is will she/won't she - the main character lost her husband 3 years before the book starts and has trouble committing to a new relationship. Blake gives us no understanding of her other than that she's hot; although there are some subsidiary characters, her interactions with them amount to about 10 pages. Her love interest is equally 2-dimensional: a ghetto boy (but white!) who hits it big as a hip hop star. Even their relationship - with the exception of a good dozen extended sex scenes - is barely sketched in.The cover picture is completely deceptive. They've got no business showing a guy with a guitar - there's not a single instance of Trax (ugh) playing an instrument, and there's not even much music in the book. But he's sexy because he's got a tattoo of a Rilke poem on his inner arm (Rilke's the first poet we all think of when hip hop comes up, right?). And she's never described wearing anything other than short, tight city clothes. Because, after all, women who've spent their whole lives in a 1000-person town in Montana love to dress like hookers and go to LA dance clubs.Liora Blake doesn't write badly from a technical point of view, but she's cobbled this book together from a couple of ideas, and the whole thing never gels.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I1POUTLS1M9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OK6U#wasThisHelpful","R3I1POUTLS1M9A","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved the first 3 books of this series, but this one not so much.  Let me start by saying I HATE cliffhangers. Daniels used one before - in book 2 - but at least she'd completed the story before she left us hanging. This time the story  just stops, right in the middle. Beyond that, the first several chapters have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. So basically she's given us part of a book.As far as the plot itself goes, it's ok (if incomplete), but the characters don't develop at all, and I'm getting pretty tired of Kit Colbana, the only female character worth a damn, surrounded by males who love and admire her. I don't know why a woman writer is so reluctant to allow her female lead to have women friends, but in Daniels' world women who can fight are either terribly annoying or downright evil (excepting always Kit, the wonder woman). Kit's no Mary Sue - she's definitely failed at things, which is one of the elements that made Books 2 & 3 so engrossing - but in this book she feels flat and uninteresting. Daniels should take a lead from Ilona Andrews on how to allow her main character to shine even among other kick-ass female characters.It seems as if Daniels is attempting to string this series along. Instead of dealing with the aneira world that was so tantalizingly held out to us in books 1-3, she's gone in a completely new direction, and if this cliffhanger is anything to go by, she plans to use the new storyline in a multi-book arc. But I don't want the new arc yet - I want to understand aneira.  This book was really disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUJR7W4EENB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH6X45E#wasThisHelpful","RMUJR7W4EENB6","A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OXO does a good job of making utilitarian items function better and this hook is no exception. It's made of strong, but not stiff plastic, so it doesn't scratch your door. Its hanging system is deep enough to fit over the top of even quite thick doors, while a ""thumb"" projects out to hold it securely in place on thinner doors. There are two hooks, covered in plastic ""bulbs,"" which catch any fabric item you want to hang nicely, although they're too thick for items with narrow hanging holes.

"This is a very simple, structured bag. It's very stiff but seems nicely constructed. I didn't want real leather, but the material has a nice hand that could pass for leather. The magnetic closure is on the brown flap (under the rivet) - it adheres to the bag flap, but it's not a strong hold. The strap is nicely adjustable, so if you like a long crossbody you can arrange that, while a short one is also manageable. There are no pockets anywhere, and the body is surprisingly deep. When combined with the stiffness of the construction, it means you have to do some digging to get things out.I got the orange, which is a lovely dark spice color.

"Last time I needed bath linens I caved to social pressure and went to restoration hardware.  While their linens are luxuriously soft and generously sized, the towels take FOREVER to dry, and stitches on the rugs started pulling in a big way from the moment I put them down.  This time, I thought I'd try Amazon, and I'm very pleased with these linens.  I don't exactly understand this, but the Pinzon 820 gram towel is not as heavy as restoration hardware's 802 gram towel, so the drying time is not so extreme, while the towel is still soft and absorbent.

"The world building in Anne Bishop's recent series - this is book 2 with Written In Red: A Novel of the Others the 1st book - is terrific, and unlike anything else I've read.  The characters are excellent, the action is intense in places,  and the writing is masterful.  You MUST read the first book to understand what's going on here, but that's no burden; Written in Red is even better than Murder of Crows. What is lacking here is a high degree of reader engagement.  I don't know if it's because Bishop covers the perspective of so many characters; if the distinction between good and bad characters is no longer ambiguous; or if the power of the paranormals is so clear that real danger to them seems unlikely, but I didn't find myself emotionally invested in the way I did with the first book.  If I hadn't read the first book, I would probably give this 5 stars - it's just that I know Bishop can give us more!

"This is a great Flashlight. I have many XML-T6 flashlights and I love them all, but finally one that will take a 26650 battery....oh yeah, a bright light that lasts a long time! that's what I'm talkin about!Pros:+ with a 26650 battery you get a lot of up time in between recharges+comes equipped adapters to support various battery options 26650, 18650, AAA+Very lightweight despite its sizeCons:-The Lumen count on this light is grossly over estimated. I have several smaller XML-T6 flashlights that run on 18650 Batteries. Even though you can put a larger battery in this flashlight the output of the larger battery is the same as the smaller battery it just lasts longer so you are not going to double the brightness just because of the battery. Same LED engine plus Same voltage equals the same brightness as the other smaller lights. Other XML-T6 lights advertise anywhere from 800-1000 lumens and I have compared mine to commercial lights in the states that sell as 500 lumens and the XML-T6 are right about the same brightness. So there is no way this thing puts out 2000 lumens and for that I have to take away a star. if this light was advertised more honestly I would give it a 5 star rating.- Its smaller counterparts all have the ability to focus the lens this larger model does not, what a bummer.I think most folks will be more than happy with thier purchase considering the cost versus performance...Its a bang for the buck, but wish they used a more accurate description of the performance. Having several of these type of lights I knew what to expect as far as the brightness is concerned, but other buyers may not so heed my warning, if you are looking for a 2000 Lumen light this is not it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309XRC1BFFEJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOER06K#wasThisHelpful","R309XRC1BFFEJE","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, unless you carry a big bag all the time, I would not consider this an EDC item. Although it will fit in most pockets, it wont be comfortable there and its also a bit heavy. In my opinion it is a great collection of tools for the glove box for taking care of unexpected repairs. It has a knife which is great for many tasks. Scissors which are also suited to many tasks and these are larger than the standard Swiss army knife scissors and easier to use. It has a saw blade which is good for cutting through hose material or plastic bumper material that is dragging on the ground or in the wheel well after a fender bender. It has both a Philips and flat tip screw driver, an adjustable wrench, flash light and allen wrenches all of which are handy in day to day uses and road side emergencies. This is perfect to keep in a glove box or next to your spare tire kit.The only reason this does not get a full 5 stars in my opinion is that the allen wrenches are metric. This is fine for me because I drive an import, but it would be nice to have the option to buy the same tool with SAE sized wrenches in case you drive American, however I guess even Amercian cars these days are using metric hardware so maybe its not that big a deal unless you are using this for something other than roadside use.It also has a Ferro Rod for sparking up tinder, Not really useful to me in the manner I use this tool, but some might appreciate that it's there so its worth mentioning. it strikes fairly well with the serrated side of the knife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3M9X8K3WVOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E22OGS#wasThisHelpful","R3L3M9X8K3WVOK","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another compelling chapter in the case of the West Memphis 3. If you are not familiar with this case or the HBO Paradise Lost trilogy you really must watch this to see how local politics and corrupt public service workers can put 3 innocent teens on death row while the real killer goes free. If you are interested in this case I would recommend the Paradise Lost series first since it is currently available free with Amazon prime. However if you do not have prime and don't want to rent the previous movies, this movie does work well on its own. It summarizes most of what happens in the first the documentaries and then gives some additional information not in the first 3 films . After watching the first Paradise lost film I was compelled to watch the remaining film, then this film, and also purchases some of the books By Damien Echols, the oldest of the 3 teens sentenced to death row who had used his 18 years on death row to become a very proficient writer.  The story of how these Kids were wronged by the justice system yet never gave up to despair and managed to walk away with most of their humanity intact while seeing the murder who put them in their situation walk free from persecution is both inspiring and gut wrenching at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGQO7WIV86LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHKXHBY#wasThisHelpful","R1YGQO7WIV86LN","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will light while wet and stay lit even if submerged in water. Comes in a easy to store plastic can. Only have 2 complaints. (1) the striker is flimsily attached to the outside of the case so it peels off too easily. Personally I prefer peeling off the striker and putting it inside the plastic case to prevent it from getting wet. Or if you carry a EDC tin, just super glue it to the inside of the lid of your tin to keep it safe. (2) Other competitor products are capable of being struck with out a striker so these are kind of lower grade than some others out there. However, even though similar products are better quality these are way cheaper.  There are many ways for matches to fail and lighting a fire with a match is often a war of attrition. Keeping that in mind you may want to ask yourself...Do I feel more comfortable buying a large amount decent quality matches or a small amount of excellent quality matches.

"These lighters are very handy. They can be used as both a standard lighter or a torch lighter although I mainly use it as a torch for both work and crafts. There is a bit of a quirk with the operation of it. In my experience if you want to use it in standard lighter mode you have to first light it in torch mode then switch. Switching back while ignited tends to blow the flame out completely. Not a big deal for me since I rarely use the standard lighter feature anyway but it is worth mentioning for others who are interested in this mode. The main reason I give this torch 5 stars is the igniter. I have several other torches I've used before from nameless cheapo brands to more expensive Benz-o-matics. None I have used that are both this small and have a built in igniter that actually works consistently. Most either need to be sparked using a lighter or match, or have an igniter so terrible you end up clicking 10 to 15 times before you actually get a flame. That translates into a lot of wasted fuel. This one is very efficient, strikes a flame virtually every click and costs less for 2 than it does for 1 of the other brands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTTJTRKL7E3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY6G6RU#wasThisHelpful","R3UTTJTRKL7E3L","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This makes a great keychain and ensures I always have scissors handy. I also like that it has a bottle opener and a knife, but also having a serrated knife is overkill for me and would prefer to see something different, the Philips screwdriver is also kind of worthless and it is not really made to work with any philips screw I have ever seen. All that aside I still give this tool 5 stars because the 3 tools I do use work well and worth the $10 price tag on their own.

"I got 2 of these, one for myself and one for a co-worker. As a technician we are often building cable connectors and wiring electronic devices. Many times we are asked to go out in the field to troubleshoot, find a damaged cable or wire and think ""I wish I had my wire strippers with me!"" . This tool has been a life saver time and time again and I have only owned it a short time. It comes with several tools, but I mainly find 3 of them irreplaceable. (1) the wire stripper for stripping wire (2) the Knife for cutting off the insulation jacket from cables (3) the Scissors for trimming the braided shield present on many types of cable. If I have to re-terminate a cable re-using the original connector, 9 times out of 10 I can make it happen using just this tool and a little ingenuity. I also think the way Leatherman designed the spring system in the wire strippers is top notch. where most Strippers have a coil spring that would not work on a tool that folds up like the leatherman. The way they tackled this problem was a very clever design and one that will likely outlast a normal coil spring. It is a little pricey considering the small size of the tool, but since there are no others on the market like it that I have found it has been worth the price for already. The strippers handle wire sizes from 14 to 22 AWG which is about 75%of the cables I work with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IC08O6BR0W0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032Y2OTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IC08O6BR0W0H","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is no safety on it but the switch takes quite a few pounds of force to deploy so it is very safe for pocket carry. If anything (even something as weak as a piece of paper or thin fabric) interrupts the deployment it knocks the blade off the track to prevent injury. The blade can then easily be pulled out manually and locked into position. I only have one other OTF knife and it is a single action only by another well known american manufacturer known for good quality knives. With all the safety mechanisms in the more expensive American made knife it still managed to deploy and cut me. The injury was minor but avoidable. This knife in my opinion is much safer and is a double action not just a single action like the more popular american made ones.I don't know what kind of steel is used in the blade but the blade on this knife is awesome. Most OTF knives have slimmer lightweight blades. This one is hefty size and the profile on the edge is very nice. The blade comes super sharp and I use mine a lot with no wear to the edge yet. There is a little play on the lock up but it is very slight and this is something that is fairly common with any automatic OTF knife. this one locks up pretty good considering its cheap price. I have seen OTF knives that cost 3 times as much as this one that have more slop in the blade than this one.  If you are looking for a double action OTF knife just to add to your collection you cant beat this one for the price. It will even serve you well as an EDC knife as long as you realize its limitations. It cant do real heavy tasks because of the play in the blade and the possibility of breaking the action under too much force. However for opening letters, cutting rope, slicing through card board boxes. you should have no problem....Handle with care ...this thing comes surprisingly sharp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6DV1DS19Q3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODGE5XA#wasThisHelpful","R1F6DV1DS19Q3S","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The performance of this sharpener varies wildly depending on the profile of your knife. I have seen reviews saying that it works on any knife, but I have not found that to be true at all. It is also possible that mine is defective. The angle of the coarse steels seems to be more aggressive on the right side of the blade then the left. if I line the knife up dead center (aligned with the ""aiming"" notch) it forms a massive burr on the left side of the blade which is too aggressive for the fine steels to get rid of so I have to fix the edge using one of my other sharpeners.when I use this on my outdoor knives which have a more shallow profile in general, I find the performance of the edgemaker to be hit or miss. sometimes great but usually awful. On kitchen knives It is a little more consistent, but still not as great as I had expected based on reviews I read. I know I am using it correctly having seen several youtube videos of people pitching this product, I read the instructions more than once, and I have seen the instructional videos on the manufacturers website. Its not rocket science and the device is pretty simple to use. So the only determination I can  make is that this product is not as good as people say it is or the one I purchased has misaligned steels. The latter is quite possible Since two of the steels are touching and the other two are not. This hardly seems like the precision I'd been hearing about from this company. On the knives it works on it REALLY works well but on 80% of my knives (and I have a bunch) this tool does more damage than good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YI9078JIYXEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080KBKZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YI9078JIYXEA","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this at the right time since the price went up since my purchase but even at the current price it is definitely worth it. It is not very expensive and it is not full tang like some of the competitor models however, the tang does extended about 1/3 of the handle legth and the nylon handle is very sturdy so I am not concerned at all about the tomahawk breaking. The lack of a full tang also keeps the wieght managable on this tool so I think over all it is well balanced and I am not concerned about  durability...I put it through some Hell the first time I used it and took everything I threw at it. After a weekend of heavy chopping and splitting, I took it home rinsed it in the sink and dried it off thoroughly to find 2 small scuffs on the nylon (barely noticeable) and no wear whatsoever on the edge or the black finish. This thing is though for a bargain priced tomahawk. I was told that United cutlery is a less than  desirable brand but if their other products hold up as well as this one then they are definitely worth the price you pay for them.The only disappointment was the paracord wrap. It is a very simple bush league wrap job on the handle, but I figured that would be the case from the picture. After about 20 minutes of use all the paracord came loose and began slididng off the handle. Then I cut a peice with my knife and found that (of course) they did not use legit 550 cord. No biggie, I had plenty on hand and I re wrapped it with the real stuff in jiffy and was back to chopping in no time. This doesn't really make a big difference in the performance of the Tomahawk, however, I know how some folks get about their cordage so I mention it just because if you are buying this with the idea that the paracord wrap is a bonus then you are better off getting one of their other models that are not wrapped. You might save a few bucks and you will be much happier if you wrap it yourself the right way with the right stuff. besides, it takes less than $5 of cord to wrap this handle so the wrapped version is not that much of a better deal, the only reason I got that version is that it was on sale. United Cutlery has about a Dozen other versions of this M48 Hawk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R263A2XCGMJXWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073TG77G#wasThisHelpful","R263A2XCGMJXWO","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are convenient little scissors for small jobs or a quick snip of a loose thread or something like that. I find that the scissors on my multi tool or Swiss army knives are easier to control and cut way better. The Spring pin that releases the scissors from my keys had a little corrosion on it which is kind of a let down. So many people talk about the high quality of True Utility products I was surprised to see the corrosion. I was able to break through it with some metal polish so it isn't the end of the world just a bit disappointing, especially since this product came packed in a cool water tight box. The Spring in the scissors is a bit too strong so it makes cutting a challenge particularly if you are going for a straight line. I imagine they put a real tense spring because this tool is stored with the spring in its compressed state and they want it to last a while. It might break in with enough use, but these are so hard to cut with efficiently that you probably wont use them enough to break them in. If you already carry a multi tool with a scissor function then skip these completely. If you don't carry a knife or multi tool everyday and like the idea of having a scissor handy then I guess this is better than not having any scissors at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33F0WKZQMOVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IOHPEA#wasThisHelpful","R33F0WKZQMOVH","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Those lights are rated at 120 lumens and they blow this Welltop light away. The Tank007s also use a single AAA battery, is waterproof, and it is actually about 1/2 the size of this Welltop.

"Another beautiful Knife by Kershaw. I have never been disappointed with any of my Kershaw knives and this one is no exception. It is well constructed. the finish has a satin like smooth feeling in the hand and is very attractive. The Speed safe deployment is as good as my other Kershaws which is to say it is better than most. The jimping on the back is comfortable an not too aggressive. the clip can be adjusted in 4 positions and is a deep pocket clip. The blade locks firmly in place using a frame lock system which has an over travel protection built in. This is a great ""not too large"" sized knife that I will mainly use as an EDC knife while wearing business causal clothing when carrying a larger knife is not possible. It would probably meet most peoples EDC needs, but it is so nice it makes me want to pamper it. However it is a Kershaw so I am sure it can handle the punishment if necessary. I have purchased many Kershaws over the years and find them to be top notch knives that are extremely well built and more affordable than most of the knifes of similar value on the market. You're not gonna find a much finer folding knife for $25.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1V15OJFQW6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074FI28Q#wasThisHelpful","R3W1V15OJFQW6Q","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very high quality sturdy knife for the price. The knife is easily worth more than its $26 price tag in my opinion. I saw another review that stated this is not a survival knife or good for bushcraft. Depending on what specific task you need it for,that may be a fair overall assesment, but for what I use it for, this knife is perfect. I am a contractor that does a lot of work aboard Naval ships. The coating on the blade helps with preventing rust. The grips are impervious to moisture and allow for a good grip wet or dry. The recurved blade makes it better suited than a straight knife for cutting through nylon webbing, nylon or fibrous rope, and box material such as cardboard or tri-wall. It cuts well on cable insulation and rubber too. a lot of folks don't like recurved blades because there is no belly for more common cutting tasks. What I like about this knife is that even though it calls itself a tanto, the point of the knife is not straight, it is slightly curved which emulates the belly of a more common drop point blade. So you get the benefit of the hard working recurved blade without loosing the functionality of a smaller outwardly curved blade. I also like that it is a stout full tang knife that is well balanced blade to handle. It feels comfortable in my hands even though its size is a bit in the middle. You can either consider it a small big knife or a large small knife if that makes any sense. It is smaller than a survival knife but probably too big for a neck knife for most people, which is probably why the Nylon sheath is comes with is only set up for a belt wear option. In my line of work I can find a million uses for this knife and it is made extremely well for such an affordable knife.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWGOCHHRQPJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIY2K1G#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWGOCHHRQPJB","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best part about this knife is the price. there isn't a lot of great craftsmanship that went into putting this knife together The overall assmbly is a bit sloppy and mine even had some surface rust in the grooves at the top of the blade on both sides. The sheath is also just barely functional. I can remove my knife from the sheath even without unsnapping the retention button. Finally the blade was not honed very well either.This knife isn't completely hopeless though. If you don't mind putting a new edge on the blade, modify the sheath or possibly make a new one, and are not too hung up on cosmetics, this knife can be a good bargain work horse for you. Once I re-honed it and removed the rust spots, this knife works great and because it was so inexpensive, i don't feel bad about abusing the heck out of it. It holds an edge well under abuse and it can't get any uglier than it was than I received it so its become by go to knife for dirty jobs. It could benefit from a slightly larger handle but if you have smaller hands then it might be comfortable for you. I prefer a larger grip, particularly from my fixed blade knives and this one is a tiny bit too small for my liking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R110B66CIHW4PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F0S6IC#wasThisHelpful","R110B66CIHW4PN","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pattern etched in the blade is really cool looking and it is a sturdy little knife for its size. the butt of the handle can be used as a small wrench in theory, however, I think the way the sales stick out, actually using it for that purpose would be impracticle.

"Really cool piece of kit for the low price. This is a small handy knife for under 10 bucks It can be easily be worn around the neck with a ball chain or piece of paracord and it would weigh about as much a a medium sized pendant. It might make a good key chain except there is no way to lock the blade from opening, so if you carry your keys in a pocket it could be dangerous.  Mine arrived super sharp out of the box. The finish is hard to decipher in the images but the scales are a satin brushed finish which contrasts against the blade which is a bit shinier. Not polished but shinier.It has a real eligant look to it when closed. When opened, I can only get a 3 finger grip on the scales, however the way the heel of the blade is notched for your index finger and the scales have a conformable curve, the knife is real stable in my hand even if my pinky is not griping the handle.I admit that this knife is something of a novelty, but for the cheap price and the attractive design it is worth buying.

"This is a sturdy and well built knife with a razor sharp cutting edge. The handle is heavy and thick with Jimpng on the spine for a comfortable grip even in big hands. The blade is heave and fat which provides a good balance with the weighty handle. the blade is a strange combination between a re-curved blade and a hawkbill. I've never had anything shaped quite like this but it is very usable in a lot of situations. Even though the blade is shorter than 3 inches to accommodate a multitude of carry laws...it seams that you get more than 3 inches of cutting edge because of the unique curvature of the blade, although its difficult to measure the shape so I can't know for sure. I just know this short stout blade is just as effective for cutting as any of my 4 to 5 inch blades. There is a have metal portion on the butt of the handle which can be useful for impact needs. The pocket clip can be placed in 4 locations not only making it top or bottom but also righty and lefty adjustable. It has a lanyard hole just big enough for a paracord lanyard if you choose to make one and the stiffness in the slip joint is powerful so even though there is no blade lock, this knife will never close on you by mistake. It requires two hands to open and close it.There are a lot of reviews on this knife talking about how it doesn't have a lock or does not compare well to models put out by other manufacturers. Technically this is true, there are better everyday knives out there, but here is where they don't match up. this knife complies with knife carrying laws of many different countries and states. in my line of work I have to do a lot of domestic and overseas travel and having a good knife is definitely a benefit to my job. This knife meets the criteria for all the locations I normally travel too where many of my other knives do not. The other benefit is even if you do not travel, you will be hard pressed to find a sturdy and hansom knife of this quality for the ridiculously low price point of the Lansky World Legal. I have never in my life bought a knife this well made for under $20. When I saw the price of this knife I was expecting junk, especially since Lansky is not really known for making knives, they make sharpeners! If Lansky continues to put out quality knives at this price point I may never buy another brand again.

"I bought this knife because It looks like a tiny little Spyderco knife with a bottle opener, and lets face it...with backyard grilling season right around the corner, who couldn't use another bottle opener, Right? Well turns out this is a pretty cool little knife. It is super small and the handle is really well designed. Even though I can only get about 2 fingers around the handle with my large hands, the curve in the handle locks it tight in my hand for a surprisingly good grip...even with the smooth texture on the scales. The lanyard hole is big enough for me to put a ball chain through and I wear it around my neck although I could see lots of folks using it as a keychain instead.There is no locking mechanism on this Knife. Its a basic slipjoint style knife. It hold open very stiff though so I wouldn't worry about it closing during use and even though there is a Thumb hole reminiscent of a Syderco blade I would say the slipjoint is too stiff to comfortably open one handed. It can be done, but not worth the hassle.This knife has many every day uses like opening mail or packages for example.

"I was looking for a Karambit, but wasn't sure if I would like this style of knife so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something I would never use. Never having bought a TacForce brand product before I took a chance and Purchased 2 different models from another vendor. I have to say, that for a $10 price tag both of the knives I bought are of surprisingly good quality, nice weight, sturdy build, and the blades are nicely sharpened right out of the box. I think they are both worth the tiny price.The only bad thing about this model (TF-620) is that it is a smaller knife in general. It has a smaller blade than the other model I purchased (the other one is a TF-543 if anyone is interested) and the handle is also smaller which makes it a bad fit for my larger hands. The Karambit is designed as a fighting knife that is held with the index finger in the hole and the blade sticking out of the bottom of the fist curling towards the intended target. I cannot hold it in this way because my hand is too wide to fit the grip. It does however fit in my hand the reverse way with my pinky in the hole and the blade coming out of the top of my fist. Although this is not really the way its supposed to be carried, I have found this method to be useful for things other than fighting. It gives you a solid grip of the knife. Curved blades are also very good at cutting through fabric, carpet, heavy rope, and nylon banding. So if you need a knife for jobs like installing carpet, working in a warehouse or the shipping and receiving department where you need to cut rope, open boxes and cutting banding material this little knife is very practical for non-combat uses and it is a surprisingly stout and tough lil folding knife for the tiny price. If you need something for self defense or martial arts training, get the larger model TF-543. it doesn't come in desert Camo but they do have a winter camo version for the same price as this knife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXQS5LO2K09I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFE338Q#wasThisHelpful","R3TXQS5LO2K09I","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Cheap way to restore a drawer full of knives in an afternoon. I have a set of Wusthof Knives that I got as a gift from my mother in law and they must have cost her a fortune. It came with a Fillet Knife, Boning Knife, and 11"" chef Knife and they worked amazing for over 15 years now. I took great care of them and now after all those years of use they were ready to be resharpened back to their former glory. All the culinary cutlery places around here wanted a lot of money to sharpen each knife then I saw a commercial for the Work Sharp and thought...that machine costs about the same as getting each knife sharpened by a professional once.Based on the good reviews I took a risk and tried this with my much coveted Wustofs. Just using a medium belt and follwoing up with the fine my knives were as good as they were out of the box, maybe even better if memory serves me right. Soon I was rounding up every knife and scissor in the house and putting bright new polished edges on them that cut like a razor. It works fast with little friction so the knives never get too hot, so you don't have to worry about them losing their temper. It also puts a convex edge on the blade which means the edge holds longer and as long as you keep your knives Steeled and stropped regularly, the edge will last a long long long time. When you feel your blade getting dull. give it a good stropping and it probably will surprise you how sharp it is. One use of this sharpener on a knife will give you years of good cutting on that blade before you have to resharpen it completely again assuming you are properly caring for your blades. It isnt something you'll have to use often if you do it right the first time or you will be taking too much metal off of your blades, however, it is still handy to keep around to resharpen other items around the house that do take a lot of punishment such as Hatchets and Mower blades.The unit has 2 guides that will handle most of your knife needs. kitchen knives, field knives, hunting knives, and scissors.  If you remove the guides the belt train can be rotated and locked in a horizontal configuration that can be used in a free hand operation to sharpen Hatchets, Axes, Sickles and lawnmower blades etc. It also has a 3 position switch witch works as a ""push and hold to power"", off, and ""press once to power"" so it you want to lock it in the on position while grinding larger objects like a lawnmower blade you can without having to hold the button down the whole time. They thought of everything on this one. There are sooooo many sharpening devices for a wide rang of prices and I own many of them, but this one is actually as easy to operate as it claims and works as good as it claims too.It also claims to do serrated edges and Gut hooks too. I cant tell you about the serrated blades because I don't own any. Never liked them so I haven't tried. Maybe I will do one for a friend and see. For gut hooks ...your mileage may vary. To do the gut hooks and serrated blades you need to use the fine grit belt which will bend. When I try this the abrasive scrapes off the belt easily. it is done with the guide off so good technique may help, apparently I'm not real good at it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3739818CRSGHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003IT5F14#wasThisHelpful","R3739818CRSGHY","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a Colt G10 Marlin Spike from Ebay not too long ago for about 11 bucks. Its a nice knife and that design has been around for a while and lots of people use it. Its popular, its cheap, it works, and When I was in the Navy it seemed like everyone was walking around with one. When I bought mine recently I was replacing the old one I had from back in my navy days and I was surprised to see that it only cost $11 which is about what I paid for one 20 years ago.  Well I soon saw why, they were made a lot cheaper now with rough edges and stiff hinges. I had to run mine under a buffing wheel because the rough edges were catching on my clothes and pockets. Maybe my old one was just as bad and I don't remember but either way is was low quality, but what do you expect for $12.A month later I found this Maxam for $4 less than the Colt  it has more features, is well put together, and in my opinion better overall quality by comparison.The Spike on this one is a little smaller than the Colt but that is better for me since I normally work with small rope and cord and don't need something too large. Its a good size for most jobs on your average sailboat. I wish I had found this one earlier I would have saved 4 bucks and been a lot happier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Y0UZO5ELL32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003COEDMW#wasThisHelpful","R32Y0UZO5ELL32","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It arrived in less than a week from Brooklyn NY which was way ahead of schedule according to the tracking information provided. She absolutely loves hers as much as I love mine.

"I was going to make my own Jig for making bracelets but then saw how cheap this one was with prime shipping and figured, what's the point. For the price of materials, my time in building it, and the effort to buy all the parts of a DIY rig, I could have this one delivered to my door in 2 days for about the same cost and much less effort.For a beginner Jig you cant go wrong with this. It is easy to use, can be adapted to any buckles you may use, and is fairly tough for its size. My only major problem with it is that It doesn't fit well on my work bench and I haven't figured out a way to clamp it down sturdy in a way that is comfortable to use. I suppose most people would find it comfortable to use on their lap clamped between their legs but that doesn't work for me because It forces me to hold my head down constantly.If you can figure out a comfortable way to set it up in your home or workshop then its hard to argue with the value of this item, particularly when available for Prime shipping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDL8GI3K6H7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV6EZK6#wasThisHelpful","RHDL8GI3K6H7I","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good for measuring ring size, but not the best for sizing. The mandrel is made of soft metal, presumably aluminum. If you are sizing rings made of harder metals then it will get marred and worn after repeated use. It worked okay for gold and silver rings at first. I used it to make rings out of old coins made from harder alloys and it wore even more. If you are looking for a mandrel for working your rings I would suggest one made from stainless steel which are not that much more expensive. Even using this with softer metals it will eventually wear down and then you may not be able to trust the sizes printed on it. If you need a kit simply for measuring rings and fingers then this will be more than adequate for that purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U9IKOKGK1ATO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AH85VLS#wasThisHelpful","R3U9IKOKGK1ATO","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great deal for the price. The batteries work about as well as the original OEM battery in my phone despite the fact that they actually have a lower mAh rating than the original. I prefer walking around with an extra fully charged battery instead of a charger. It takes up less room in my pocket and is instantly ready with 100% charge. way more convenient that looking for places to plug in, carrying around a battery bank, or being tethered to your computer all day. I work in the field most of the time and aside from my car there is nowhere I can stop and charge. Now I just slip a couple extra batteries in my pocket before I leave the house and I never worry about my battery consumption.

The Onite battery lasted much longer than the original battery and I have been happy with it. several months after I bought it the charging port on my phone stopped working and I found this external charger that came with 2 Onite batteries. This purchase was a no brainer, an external charger that comes with 2 batteries I already know to be great. I saw some bad comments about the pins on the charger being broken or getting damaged.

"I was a teenager when Genesis was at the height of its popularity and I remember spending a lot of my best years playing (or perhaps wasting my life) playing Genesis. I saw that this company made 2 different units...A console version which allows you to play your old cartridges and the portable version shown here. I opted for the portable version so that my son could use it to keep entertained on long car trips. Also I didn't want to go up into the attic and find my box of Genesis Cartridges that I am convinced is still up there!This unit is surprisingly small, surprisingly light weight (weighing less than a Nintendo gameboy or DS). The battery is small but lasts surprisingly long. Comes with 80 preloaded games. Many of the games stink (E-S.W.A.T., Altered Beast, and other crappy 1st generation Genesis games). It does also include some of the better games though. Almost all of the Sonic series, The entire Echo the Dolphin set (I actually enjoy that series), and Virtua Fighter along with other fun games. Its nostalgic and fun to play with. You can even output it the video to a TV if you have a TV with a Composite input. It's not my sons favorite game system, but when we are stuck in the car a few hours, he surely enjoys it then so between the two of us using it...We got our money's worth.The only problem with the system in my opinion is the SD card feature. It is intended that you can go on the website and download more game ROMS to expand your library of games by playing them off the SD Card. The problem is that the manufacturer must be a company in its infant stages still, so their website doesn't really have any game titles to download yet. In fact the only game ROMs I saw there were for the games already preloaded on the machine. Maybe in the future there will be more support and options for this feature, but I would say to anyone who plans to buy this then download a bunch of their favorite games....buyer beware...you may want to visit the manufacturers website to see if any new games are available before you buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YEGDG3IJD0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMC6R9G#wasThisHelpful","R3YEGDG3IJD0S","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Practical little device. If you want a simple machine to do routine online tasks with, this little box is perfect. It might not have the power to play advanced video games, render and edit video projects, or photoshop, but it does all the routine stuff easily, efficiently,and most of all cheaply.If you have a Google account just register your account on this device and you will have access to email, google app store, google documents, GMail. I was looking for a cheap second computer in the house for doing the everyday stuff like paying bills, google searches, email etc. For the price of about $200 this is a pretty decent little web machine. Here are some of the things I really like about it-It boots up way faster than a normal computer.-Its small and can be mounted directly to the tv or monitor so it has no footprint.-it has a small drive but virtually all of your actions on the machine are backed up to your google account so you don't need to physically store much data on your local machine.-it runs apps similar to a smartphone instead of large programs so it is frugal on memory. It runs fast and never locks up.-Its portable. just bring the contents of this box and an HDMI cable in your luggage and you can turn any HDTV with an HDMI port into a mobile computer.We bought this primarily to be used by my son for school work. He is ready to start using a computer on his own but still too young to justify buying an expensive and overly complicated computer. I can see this platform being practical for most families or even older users that want to use simple web based media like Facebook but are not comfortable using a Microsoft or Apple platform computer. This does most things you need to handle online, it is cheap, has an easy to learn operating system, and can be configured to work with any TV or monitor in about 10 minutes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDGI96ZJZXQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNQDXUW#wasThisHelpful","R3CDGI96ZJZXQ8","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Over all this Balaclava will keep your head and face warm for the most part so it isn't completely useless. However, this thing has too many problems to give a good review. some of the problems are.- Strong Chemical odor that requires a couple washes before it is completely gone.-Although you may somehow figure out a way to make it a ""6 in 1"" good luck making it look like any of the pictures in the description. any attempt to make this thing look like a hat of any kind looks completely ridiculous.- It is too small to be comfortable. It is too small on the crown of the head and it is also to short at the neck. I bought this to wear with a North Face Jacket that does not have its own hood. Since my jacket has a raised collar you should be able to tuck this hood into the jacket collar to have an over lapping seam with no exposed skin. Unfortunately the neck of the hood is way shorter than the images depict so only comes down to just below my scalp and leaves most of my neck exposed.

"I was expecting this face mask to be more suitable for cold and windy days. I like the idea that it seals off the bottom of the hard hat to prevent cold gusts of air from blowing under your hard hat and chilling your head. At first glance it looks like a great Idea. Unfortunately The knit of the fabric is not very good at blocking wind and is not particularly warm either.When I read the description of the product again after using it on a cold windy day I saw that I misread it. It states that it protects ears and head from wind and cool conditions. Does not say cold and windy conditions. That begs the question, Why would I need to wear a ski mask on a day with ""cool"" conditions? So since it does not specifically claim to be for Winter weather, I would argue what is the point of covering that much of your face on just a cool day and if you are not using this to fight off the cold then there really isn't a point in having it. There are similar Balaclavas and face masks available on Amazon made from polyester of  fleece which are much warmer.

"I have used a lot of different screen protecting films in the past and was skeptical that this one would be worth almost $7. The only reason I decided to try it is because of the good reviews it got.First of all if you never put one of these or a similar product on your phone before, let me do you a small favor and explain how it works. (A) clean your device with the alcohol wipe included (B) wipe with lint free cloth provided (C) Use blue sticky tape provided to remove any fine dust (D) peel backing off screen protector being careful not to touch the adhesive side (E) place on phone and squeeze out bubbles.Now, I know this is a review and not a tutorial, but if you buy this product and don't know how to use it...you will go insane because the instructions included are completely beyond comprehension and amounts to a bowl of tossed word salad (photo of instructions attached to this review).  I ignored the instructions and used experience and common sense to figure it out and my application came out flawless.The glass is very resistant to scratches. I have a tough job where my phone gets bumped, scraped, and scuffed every day. This glass protector is much more resilient than the plastic or vinyl sheets I've used before. The others are way cheaper, but when you look at how many you use in a year compared to how long this one lasts, this is actually a superior and more affordable product.Another thing worth mentioning to anyone who has used the plastic covers, the adhesive used on this glass protector is very easy to work with. as long as the surface is clean...line up the glass and press in the center and the adhesive clings to every inch of the phone leaving no bubbles behind at all.  Nothing is more frustrating then taking the time to clean every spec of dust off of your phone or tablet, then you carefully lay the screen protector on and you get a few rogue bubbles that refuse to come out! drives me nuts!....no such problems with this product.

"Its a very soft pillow, but not much else to say. I followed the instructions as to how much water to add for reaching the desired results (soft, medium, firm support) but even with the highests amount of water or lowest amount of water I felt little difference. In fact , you rally cant even tell there's water in it at all. the only thing the water seems to do is weigh the pillow down at the bottom so it doesn't go flying off the bed every time you turn which would be very easy to do since the stuffing in the pillow is extremely light and fluffy. Without the water in it the pillow has almost no weight to it at all. If you like a big airy fluffy pillow that doesn't collapse or lose its shape after a few days you will really like this pillow. It is a quality pillow for a soft pillow. I prefer a firmer pillow so it is not right for me.

This set up looks cool and is thrifty on space.Although I like this product overall, there is definitely room for some improvements.1. The jars do not have any kind of gasket or seal in the caps. Its just hard plastic on Hard plastic. It is too early to tell how this will effect the overall freshness of my spices. Fortunately I go through my spices very often so They don't often get a chance to go stale. If you tend to not use spices as often and have them sit for long periods of time, you may not want to go with this set.2. The Carousel is not built well and is not stable. I ordered two of these sets at the same time. One of the carousels was broken right out of the box. The main spinning point was just a screw that was screwed into a thin brittle acrylic spindle. If it had not arrived broken, I suspect it would end up broken eventually anyway. Also, The carousel that did work was awful. It looked great but if you spin it with the jars on it, it would wobble and tumble the jars over easily.When I bought this item I did not really want the carousel in the first place, I just wanted the Jars. The jars are available individually on Amazon but they cost almost $2 each. Since I wanted 24 Jars, buying 2 carousel sets with free prime shipping and throwing out the carousels was much cheaper than buying 24 individual jars and I received them faster. So for me it worked out to be a pretty good deal. If you are buying this set because you really want to use the carousel that comes with it, I would advice against it. If you still insist, at least consider keeping the heavier jars towards the bottom, that will make the carousel at least a little bit more stable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R8HNWMGUNLBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019RNO74#wasThisHelpful","R2R8HNWMGUNLBR","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this because I was looking for a clay mask to dry out my oily pores. I had used other clay mask type products before and they all have been pretty effective even the cheap ones. The problem is that they must not be very popular anymore because none of my local drug stores carry them anymore. I stumbled on Aztec Secrets here on Amazon and with all the great reviews I figured it was worth a try.The first thing I noticed is that it is very affordable and it is not pre-mixed. Since you mix up each batch before you use it the 2lbs in the container will last you a long long time. They instructions suggest mixing with apple cider vinegar so even if you include the cost of the vinegar to the total price, this stuff is way cheaper than any other similar product I have ever used.The mud doesn't really have an odor to it so it pretty much smells like vinegar when you use it. That might not be a problem for you but I hate it. Some reviewers recommended using this product with Bragg's Unfiltered Cider vinegar. I did not notice that the results are any better with the Bragg's But the smell was way smellier when using it.  You can also mix it with plain water too, but as other reviewers mentioned It does make it harder to mix and I feel that you get a more homogeneous mixture with vinegar.After washing off, it does leave my skin looking a bit red which other products I've used in the past will not do, but the redness goes away fast leaving my skin very smooth and oil free.I think this product is about equal to other products I have used in the past and is nothing special in comparison, However, if you are ok with the vinegar smell and mixing up your own batches of mud, then this is a very effective product that will save you a ton of cash in the long run. I suspect this 2lb container will last me a long long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADCXNCYFO1J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00772AKMM#wasThisHelpful","R3ADCXNCYFO1J9","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a sample pack of blades about a year ago and among the razors in the batch were Astra and these Astra Superior Premium Platinum. Both were good but the Superior Premium Platinum performed much better with less drag on my face. It is difficult to give a review on something like razor blades because everyone has different skin and beard characteristics and opinions and brand loyalties are subjective. In other words...what works well for me might not work well for everyone. What I can say is that I have a very coarse beard, and very sensitive skin and these blades give me a very close shave with no discomfort or irritation. I have used the blades both in a safety razor and in a shavette style razor and they always deliver a smooth shave. They glide well against the skin without any tugging or pulling at the hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NR0NLIDK2OS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXPTR0W#wasThisHelpful","R2NR0NLIDK2OS7","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a good sandalwood cologne that is affordable and actually smells like sandalwood. There are a lot of good sandalwood colognes out there that cost an arm and a leg. There are also many affordable ones out there, but most of them do not smell anything like sandalwood. Caswell-Massey was recommended to me on a Shaving forum and when I saw it available on Amazon for Under $25 I quickly added it to my shopping cart.So far I have worn it twice. Once out with the family and once to work. It has a pleasant scent of a Sandalwood and soap. A very masculine woodsy, but clean scent. The scent is very persistent. I find that I can use a small amount and it is not overpowering and it lasts all day long. Even when I wore it to work it lasted all day which is amazing since it was a hot summer day doing physical work and sweating a lot. I was very sweaty by the end of the shift and yet the entire drive home I could still smell the clean soapy smell of the Cologne.If you are a fan of Sandalwood like I am you will surely like this cologne. You would be hard pressed to find a better Sandalwood cologne for a better price. If you never smelled Sandalwood before and not sure if you would like it, you may want to sample this at a department store first because Sandalwood can be an acquired taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYBV2R60VHRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010BXX4S#wasThisHelpful","R1AYBV2R60VHRS","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as grease keepers go, this one is pretty much perfect. Not that it takes much to make a good grease keeper,  its not rocket science or anything, but this one doesnt make any of the mistakes I've seen on other products for example.1. Making the holes in the strainer to large2. making it out of a heat conductive material like Stainless Steel3. making the opening too narrow to poor grease in directly from a pan.This one is made of ceramic so you can pour hot grease in and it will stay relatively cool to the touch. The opening is wide enough to pour right from my pan into the container. The removable strainer is a fine mesh and works well plus it can be removed and cleaned without having to dump your oil out.Not much I would change about this vessel except maybe adding a pour spout to make it easier to pour the grease back out, but honestly its not that difficult without the spout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3V05Q9AXC9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017U5DZY#wasThisHelpful","RX3V05Q9AXC9L","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very clean and efficient way to oil your shredder. This product was recommended to me by Amazon when I purchased a Shredder from them. I wasn't sure what to expect from the image and description...I assusmed it was just sheets of heavey paper stock saturated in oil. I figured that would be convenient because anyone who has ever oiled a shredder the old fashioned way knows it can be messy and annoying. I finally put enough paper through my shredder to actually use one of these lubricant sheets and I really like the way it works!First of all, calling them lubricant sheets is misleading. They are not sheets with lubricant on them. They are more like very thin pouches or envelopes with lubricant inside. This means your hands and skin never come in contact with the lubricant. So you can use these in the office with your nice work clothes on and not worry about staining your clothes with oil or getting it on your hands. You simple shred the envelope then run the shredder in reverse for 10 seconds to spread the oil evenly on the blades and you're done. No mess no hassle and best of all no squirt or drip bottles to mess with. Why did it take so long to come up with such a simple solution???","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R330U54SOI4RLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KAX0S0#wasThisHelpful","R330U54SOI4RLW","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description states this fragrance was Introduced in 1976. Fragrance notes: orange, lemon, bergamot, oakmoss, sandalwood and patchouli. I bought this aftershave because I was looking for an affordable Sandalwood-ish fragrance. I like the clean smell of citrus, I also enjoy the woodsy smells of oakmoss and sandalwood, but when I wear this fragrance the odor I can smell is overwhelmingly Patchouli. If you are nostalgic for the 70s you may like it but I think it smells a bit dated...If a scent can be considered dated?? reminds me of the perfumes my mom and aunts used to wear in the 70s when I was a small fry. I also think the Patchouli makes it smell too feminine.

"I have to start by saying that I originally ordered Omega Brush model 10098 which was sold by Warehouse Deals 4 Less. It was a more expensive brush, but they sent me this brush instead. I contacted Amazon and explained the problem. They offered me an exchange to the correct brush or to refund me the difference in price. I took the refund since I was in dire need of a new brush and wanted to get this one broken in right away. So Kudos to Amazon for stepping to the plate with excellent customer service.As for the brush at first glance I think most guys who have been wet shaving a while and never saw an Omega brush up close and personal will probably be amazed by the size of this thing. Its enormous! I think the size of these brushes is why so many people are fans of them. I have used boar hair brushes before but they were always too coarse. The problem is my beard is very rough and to get my whiskers lifted while lathering, soft badger bristles just don't get the job done. In addition, because I have to press so firmly with a badger brush, I tend to flatten out the bristles and wear out a brush after less than a year of service. I needed something more rough and tumble...I needed a boar hair brush that wasn't a piece of junk.This Omega is exactly what I was looking for. The Bristles have some backbone to them so I can scrub as hard as I need without worrying about damaging the bristles. The bristles are not rough and scratchy like other Boar brushes I've used in the past. The enormous loft on the bristles makes the application of lather smooth and soft. I didn't think Boar hair could feel so nice! It also has a big beefy handle that is easy to grab. The tall bristles whip up lather better than any other brush I've used before and another benefit of long bristles is that my knuckles don't hit the top of my scuttle when I am creating my lather which is something that always annoys me with smaller brushes.Now for the bad part. When you first get this brush the bristles are a bit coarse and it stinks to holy hell when you get it wet. Some people say natural bristles smell like wet dog, but I found this brush to stink of burning hair...simply awful! The good news is that the smell goes away with some breaking in. I received this on the weekend so I spent Saturday and Sunday shampooing, drying, and repeating with a strong scented body wash/shampoo conditioner. I also soaked it for a few hours in some oxy-clean. By Monday morning most of the smell was gone  and the bristles were nice and soft yet springy. About 3 shaves later you could no longer smell the nastiness. Breaking it in takes a little work, but your patience will be rewarded with some great shaves. You can either break it in with use, or by cleaning it before use, I found hundreds of forum posts on the subject and it seems that everyone has their favorite method. there's a wealth of knowledge available online  on the subject if you don't want stinky boar smell on your face. This brush is sturdy as heck so I anticipate owning and using it for a long time to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELEWYNUJXPHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BWNR9A#wasThisHelpful","RELEWYNUJXPHY","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first saw one of these years ago in one of those junk mail catalogs that wind up in your mailbox all the time. At the time I saw it it cost $300. I thought, this would be a great item for parties and I swore if they ever came down in price I was going to own one. Well this one dropped to $100 and I pulled the trigger and bought one and I am glad I did.Every summer I Brew insane amounts of iced tea and I also work outdoors in the heat and need ice to fill my water cooler for work so I am constantly running out of ice.  The Ice Maker in the fridge just can't keep up with the demand. The freezer takes 2 hours, this thing takes less than 10 minutes!When I come home from work I fill it up and it runs all night until I go to bed. Each day it produces enough ice for me to keep my summer beverages cool and at the same time make an extra bucket of ice that I use in my water cooler.Here are the only cons I have for this item.1. before you use it you may want to give it a thorough cleaning with mild detergent.. I gave mine a quick rinse instead of a thorough wash and my first batch of Ice left a plasti-like taste in my beverage when melted. Cleaning it properly before the next use fixed that.2. It judges the state of the ice by a timer not a thermostat. So 7 minutes for small ice 13 minutes for large (approximately). It takes a while for the chillers to get nice and cold so the first 2 batches or so it makes are pretty lousy little ice balls, but once she gets running up to speed, you'll easily get a pound of ice every hour. So if you are hosting a cocktail hour at your house, you might want to plug this guy in about an hour before your guests arrive. :o)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PP0SLK7DKFX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INXGA1O#wasThisHelpful","R3PP0SLK7DKFX4","A2WEDFOLI2H651","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEDFOLI2H651?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have NEVER had this bad of an experience with a company. The cost of this piece of junk is basically stolen from us, we're stuck with it. If you want further evidence, go to their social media sites. They don't allow customers to post on their pages (red flag), but when they make a post, all the comments are complaints that look exactly like mine.

"This is a really nice cage. The plastic is high quality, the wire is a little bendable, but if it gets a little bent, it's easy to bend right back. Other reviewers say it is small, and it is, depending on what critter you're putting in there. However, the size is clearly stated in the description, so that's not something to hold against the product.I had it out of the box and set up in about 2 minutes. Super easy to put together.It's deep enough that even if the door gets left open, my guinea pigs don't get out. They poke their head out (which is hilarious!), but stay put.As for size, the large guinea pig igloo that measures about 10 inches across, takes up about half of this cage. Between that and one of the standard, corner guinea pig littler pans take up pretty much all of this cage. This would be best filled with bedding and used in a more traditional way than a guinea pig cage with litter pan, etc.Update!: We had a bigger cage, the one with the canvas bottom. It was nice, except the piggies chewed through the canvas. I repaired it with tape, but I was also SO SICK of cleaning that cage out. Washing the fleece, cleaning up places where they missed their litter pan, it would smell after just a few days, and trying to keep the cage clean looking, not to mention the giant size it took up. I was so sick of it that I thought about getting rid of the pigs all together, which is sad because I love our pigs!In a last ditch effort, I filled this cage with a mix of wood shavings and paper bedding... it was TEN DAYS before it started to show any sign of being dirty and it still DIDNT SMELL! I took out the litter pan because it was taking up so much space. Since I'm not worried about keeping their fleece clean (which isn't good for the feet anyway) I happily give them BIG piles of hay, which they LOVE! They're so much happier with the pile than trying to pull it out of some fancy feeder.I put a paper bag in the bottom so the bedding comes clean off. Spray it down with Windex, and just wipe it out. Refill it and our pigs are SO HAPPY! They love being cozied in there with all their fluffy bedding. Without the litter pan, there's room to run around.So glad my guinea pigs get to stay!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYUOPT64H79G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TKRYKC#wasThisHelpful","RZYUOPT64H79G","A3934NGYZU4M6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3934NGYZU4M6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a great way to make a quick pizza at home with your favorite toppings. In the package, they resemble a white tortilla, but they don't taste like it. They're a nice, light flavor. Each has 120 calories, 22 grams of carbs and 2 grams of fiber. The allergens are wheat and soy. They aren't low-carb or whole grain, but they're very large for the calories.

"I got the medium size of this, which is a practical size for gift giving. It probably has about 2/3rds the capacity of a traditional loaf pan. It's great! I made 4 batches of banana bread batter and it filled 6 of these and 1 traditional loaf pan.6 of the size mediums fit perfectly on an 11x17 sheet for baking.There seems to be a lot of talk about the holes in the bottom. I decided to line the bottom with a small piece of parchment to prevent leaking. It worked great. I think if I wouldn't have done that, maybe some of the oil would have leaked, but they are very small holes, like a sharp pencil tip.NEXT TIME: Next time I use these I will use even more parchment that comes up and out the sides. This is basically cardboard, so it will absorb fats and be darker brown (think wet paper bag), but only on the inside. The area under the parchment didn't do that.I will post a customer picture of what a finished loaf of banana bread looks like in one of these pans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6OQ5JQED1OTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BCGWPC#wasThisHelpful","R6OQ5JQED1OTU","A3934NGYZU4M6O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3934NGYZU4M6O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I figured it was fine because I needed new spatulas and got a great deal on this set. Then I used them... they work REALLY well. I really like the smaller one for lifting cookies from the pan.The spatulas are quite large. The head on the largest one is bigger than a credit card.

"First off, it is NOT crystal. It's glass. If you're expecting a piece of Waterford, you will be speechless with disappointment! Sturdy (but remember it will break if dropped); attractive.The decanter is about as tall as a Campbell's soup can. The stopper is about three-quarters that. Decanter capacity is 1/2 cup.As to having to fill it too often: You do not need a mouthful of mouthwash to do the job! Even the Listerine bottle says to use 4 t. Let's call that 1 T (3 t), assuming the marketing folks at Listerine want you to use more than you really need. (Gosh! Would they do this?) Using 1 T, that makes 16 uses before a refill is needed. For one person, that's over a week with 2x daily use. Measure 1T of water in the cup to see how full to fill it with mouthwash. It's about half-way up.I am wondering whether the users who note their dissatisfaction about decanter capacity are filling the little cup to the brim or near it? If so, this easily accounts for the frequent-fill problem, even for a 2-person household.My dentist says I may add a little water to ""soften"" the taste (ask yours). I add a splash of water (Hey! 4 t!).Here's the one I bought; it's similar.http://www.amazon.com/CRYSTAL-CLEAR-306233-GB-Crystal-Mouthwash/dp/B0017W75YE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427843628&sr=8-1&keywords=mouthwash+bottle","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZDT80ZF5M1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018QRC3S#wasThisHelpful","RGZDT80ZF5M1S","AGTV1DMRMBRSQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTV1DMRMBRSQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical, but they do work.I was also very glad to see that the elastic straps were *exactly* the same length.  Brava, ladies!  (I'm 5'1"" and got the 3"" size.)I was happy to read they are ""made in the USA by women, for women.""  Win-win-win!A couple of tips.Put them on your jeans before *you* put on the jeans!  A comical time was had by all when I tried to attach them while wearing the jeans!  One side was sproing-ing undone before I could get the other side clipped on!I put the clips aft of the side seams, just behind the seam allowances.  This gives me the most fabric ""bite"" and maximum security of the clips' staying clipped.Wear the strap just behind the arch of the foot (not on the ball of the foot or the arch of the foot).  It stays in place there pretty well.  See the pic.Wear with the round ""shield"" of the clip against your foot.  This was the primary concern I had while [skeptically] considering this purchase:  abrasion bcs I have a high ankle bone.  Lots of shoes rub me raw.  I think it's designed to be against the boot, but it's more important to me to protect my skin than the inside of my boot!Use a shoehorn.  ""Boot"" shoehorns (long) are available; try a shoe repair shop.A pair of thin socks also will help minimize/even prevent abrasion.  Socks also make your boots easier to get on.  By ""thin,"" I mean about the thickness of men's nylon ""dress socks.""  Women's hose might work (knee or ankle type), but they are much thinner.  You'll have to experiment.  Maybe you won't want to wear any socks at all!It helps if you start with jeans that are not already knee-sprung from previous wearing (or age).  And are not boot-cut style.Do a trial run around the house before you set off to shop or travel or go to work!UPDATE:  Feb., 2015:  After wearing them about 4 times, the elastic is starting to stretch out.  Still work and are more comfortable.mb","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VWSK1MOHFPSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAGQMEW#wasThisHelpful","R1VWSK1MOHFPSL","AGTV1DMRMBRSQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTV1DMRMBRSQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What put me over the top to choose this one was the video here that demonstrated how the thing fit together.  Folks, the woman must have had silicone salve on those halves to make them slip together so easily!  My assembly did NOT work that way!  (And I've assembled a bunch of dog crates in my life!)The latch(es) on the back do not lift very easily.  I was afraid I was going to break them off; the plastic is pretty flimsy.  When it became apparent that I couldn't assemble the crate without opening them, I used a screwdriver to give them a little nudge, and they popped open enough for me to get my fingertip under them.  After half-a-dozen (I lost count!) attempts to slide the top and bottom halves together (my allotment of colorful language was exhausted), I got a semblance of a crate.  It was still not totally correct, but I used the Marine Corps method.Now the screws and wing nuts....  Note that the holes are square; the screws are round.  Work from the underside and give the screw head a good whack with a stout hammer (Semper Fi!).  This will force the round screw into the square hole, and then it's easy to twist it thru by hand.  There no slot in the screw, so you can't use a screwdriver.  Wing nut (on top) went on with ease. Extra screw and wingnut included. Kudos there.There was a slight alignment problem, as noted.  I couldn't get the top and bottom of the crate married perfectly (should've had some of that silicone stuff, huh?), so the square holes did not line up 100%, which made screw insertion even more of a party.  If you have some washers, you could use two on each corner (one on the underside at screw head and one on the top side at the wingnut).  This allows you to take advantage of the two large -round- holes where the top and bottom of the crate were wire-tied together for shipping and thus leave your hammer and a bit of your vocabulary in your toolbox.Let us now talk about the door!  You have to turn the two handles (those are the black rectangles at nine and three o'clock on the picture) in opposite directions (toward each other) so that you can attach the door.  While holding the handles in the turned position, somehow insert the top 2 and bottom 2 ends of the latch rods simultaneously.  Doing the bottom, say, and then the top doesn't work because when you try to get the top ends of the rods in place, the bottom ends have wandered out.  Let me note that the silver lip thingie (six o'clock) must be snapped into place before you begin the challenge of the handles and rod; otherwise, no go.  Oh, yes: try not to pinch your fingers.Are we having fun yet?Note that there is no top opening; nor is there a handle.  The plastic is not very robust, either.  I would not purchase another of these.  (Try Pet Porter.)Fits my mini poodle well, however (20 lbs., 15"" at shoulder). Ok for a standard poodle puppy.  A small Sheltie would fit, as would a beagle, very small Border Collie, or a couple of friendly cats.mb","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1113MC5NF2FD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6XQEY4#wasThisHelpful","R1113MC5NF2FD5","AGTV1DMRMBRSQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTV1DMRMBRSQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got wondering when I first received this emergency car starter if I would have the opportunity to actually use this ""in the field"" to give an accurate review.  I didn't have to wonder for long.The first time we used this was for charging my phone.  We lost electricity during a storm for 7 hours about a week ago.  I had plugged the unit in and fully charged it before putting it in my car so I knew it was ready to go.  I ran outside, grabbed it and got to charging my phone that was almost ready to die.  It charged in about the same time as my regular plug in charger, but as long as it was charging that was not a problem for me.  I am so glad I remembered I had it as we wouldn't have had a phone to use otherwise.  So, for phones, I can say it works great!Then two days later our car wouldn't start. I thought...can it be?  Yes, it was.  Someone had left the dome light on (again) and it had drained my battery overnight. I grabbed the unit, and my husband hooked it up in a matter of 2 minutes.  We were a bit skeptical, but it worked easily, the car started up and we were on our way.I am going to purchase one for my son's car as well.

"This is a really nice leash.  One hand operation, sturdy construction and a great color!  Personally, I  hesitate to use this style leash on a larger dog who pulls...mostly because I'm used to the chain leashes and I know they are sturdy.  I honestly hesitated, even with a medium size dog, but we used this last night and I have to say that it worked out ok.  It is the perfect length and strength for a 40-50 pound dog in my opinion.  If your dog doesn't walk well on a leash, I would continue to use a chain leash.  The dog we had who passed away (I sure do miss that girl) could pull your arm out of its socket if she saw a squirrel....and she was around 85 pounds and I would never have used this leash for her, however that is not a reflection of this leash, just a reflection on her very bad walking manners.Rest easy and use this leash for your 40-50 pound dog with no worries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NAMWJO7ISKF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKV27H8#wasThisHelpful","R3NAMWJO7ISKF9","A3EZHMGGWY74HY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZHMGGWY74HY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may or may not be a water saver as has been mentioned several times by other reviewers, however, what I can say for sure is that the air powered setting (although a bit louder than the regular) is amazing and feels fantastic on my old back.This shower head was easy to install with help from my handy man husband.  He said the instructions were easy to follow and that he felt it was a decent product. (He said he hoped it didn't feel TOO good, or he'd never be able to get me out of the bathroom!)  It did increase my water pressure, which I really like a lot.  It works really nice when you aim it on your lower back if you have troubles there.  It felt like a deep tissue massage!We can't all afford to go for a massage.  We can't all go to Physical Therapy or a chiropractor.

"The Grave Tender is by far the best book I've read in a while.  You come to know and feel the essence of the characters almost immediately.  You become embroiled in their lives, their sadness, their confusion and yes, even their insanity.  There is love, betrayal, hatred, fear, and tenderness here.  There is everything that makes us human within these pages.  There is grace and redemption.  There is friendship and loss.  It's so full of everything that makes up a life with a story that flows along effortlessly and is told with mastery.This is not an easy story to read, but read it you must.  Just when you want to turn your head away, you just can't.  You must see what happens.  You must feel along with these captivating and realistic characters.  The Grave Tender will pull you into a story that has twists and turns. unexpected joys and unthinkable tragedy.

This is a wonderful, thick and sturdy 100% cotton bag that you can count on to carry whatever it is you need to bring along with you.  I've been accused of carrying my life in my bag and maybe that's true, but the only downfall I see to that is that I'm carrying 25-30 pounds around with me that my husband (and my chiropractor) feel I could do without!

"This is the perfect way to spread scent through the house without wasting batteries or lighting a flame.  I love incense, but the smoke bothers my family to no end, especially during allergy season.  I love candles, but you always run the risk of fire if you fall asleep.  Yes, I have battery operated candles, but they don't smell like this does.  They are meant mostly for light, not for scent. This is amazing, and I can change the scent anytime I want.  It's easy to fill and to turn on. The instructions are very easy to follow and 3 minutes after opening the box, it was up and running.  It shuts off by itself once the water and oil are gone.

"Not only does this candle have a nice soft vanilla scent, but the flame is realistic, too!  I got the candle yesterday in the mail.  I quickly opened the package and got it going.  Since it's battery operated, I can put this candle anywhere, even in my windowsill near my curtains and have no fear of a fire.  So, that's what I did.  I left it on and went upstairs to bed.  An hour later I get a call from my neighbor.  He called to tell me he was outside to put out his garbage and he noticed I had a candle burning in the window and wanted to be sure I knew about it, as the house was dark and it looked like we had all gone to sleep!

After charging the unit, which took about an hour from what I could figure (I was not paying attention but am estimating) I turned it on and it took approximately 1 minute to hook it up to my Kindle.  I have never been happy with the built in speakers on my Kindle so I have been waiting to get a Bluetooth speaker to help out with that.  I was offered this AquaAudio speaker for review, so I jumped on it!  I'm so glad I did.  Not only can I take this in the bathroom with me as it's waterproof, I can take it in the car and use the suction cup on the back to adhere it to my windshield so I can listen to music while driving.

The other thing that stands out about this rug is that it's not ultra plush so when you walk up to it your foot won't get caught up against the edge of the runner like some other rugs I've had.  My mom is elderly and loves runners but has very thick ones and it's almost like she has to step up a bit to walk on them and I worry about her falling.

"I was offered this at a discount in lieu of a fair review.  I accepted this offer for the fact that I needed a sewing kit for when I travel.  It can be a VERY useful when that button falls off, a snag in your fabric, or God forbid a zipper blowout - you know what I'm talking about.  3rd degree embarrassment!However, I had to modify this kit to actually be useful.  There are two needle threaders in this kit that are really cheaply made, but still useful for emergencies.  My main complaint though is the needles - they have no use whatsoever. I had to change out the needles completely.  The eyes on these needles are soooooo tiny, that it is impossible to use the threader or to even try and thread them without the threader.  They are too small for even the thread.  Pointless!With that being said, everything else in the kit is ok.  There is a decent thread selection, although I will have to add ""cream/beige and remove one of the pinks or the purple as these are colors that I will never use. Average shirt buttons (3 incl.), and I will also add additional safety pins rather than just the 1 incl.I cannot say this kit is at a decent price point as I've have to alter several pieces in it to be useful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R89A83J2XRCWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WOSAMI#wasThisHelpful","R89A83J2XRCWE","AL5GX3Y4LRHK1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5GX3Y4LRHK1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Who knows how many there were, it was just a mad scurry!The perimeter of my back yard fence is covered in a huge lush mix of greenery from both sides of the fence, I cannot control all places for these critters to live and thrive. I bought two of these and a 4lb bag of Ramik NEOGEN RODENTICIDE Ramik Mouse and Rat Nuggets Pouch, 4-Pound, Green to see how things went.These are two very different poisons.* Bromethalin is a rodenticide (Tom Cat) which poisons the central nervous system, ultimately resulting in increased intracranial pressure, which damages neuronal axons. This damage to the central nervous system causes paralysis, convulsions, and death. This one, like most, are anticoagulants related to warfarin (the drug called Coumadin). These drugs, eaten by the rodent as an overdose, inhibit vitamin K and lead to a loss of clotting activity over several days (clotting factors require vitamin K). The ultimate result is hemorrhage.So, that being said, you can understand the cautions to your pets or children and these things smell like pet food. I have been DILIGENT with my dog and I actually carry him past anywhere near this area and put him down on a leash. All dog exercise is currently at the park until this duty is long over with.The rats do not even bother with the refillable stations. I have one with the Tom Cat bait and the other with the Ramik pellets and the rats are too smart and seem to know this is a trap. So I cut the bottoms off a few liter plastic bottles and a few jar lids as little trays as I don't want this stuff directly on the soil and filled them with Ramik pellets. They still haven't touched the Tom Cat cubes, however, they have DEMOLISHED the Ramik bait. 4lb bag in 4 days! I was refilling the containers 3+ times per day. Yesterday, I had first sign of its working.Be prepared for a sight that may be disturbing and heart wrenching at the same time. It was a rat on my drive early yesterday morning, in convulsions. Yes, it tormented me and I did what I believe was kind and covered it and gave it a smack with a hammer over the head. Yes, I cried like a baby, and so I mention this, because if you can't handle this, then just know before you decide.PLEASE be aware that if there are natural predators in your area, such as fox, feral cats, owls, hawks, etc. that these poisons rats will poison the creature that eats them as well. I say this as I live in a dense urban setting and we deal with this as an epidemic and I have never seen any predators and probably why it is a problem. I only pray that what I have done harms no other.PS...I will update this review in the winter when I have an indoor mouse problem.

I bought this and 2 Tom Cats Tomcat Rat Killer II (Kid and Dog Resistant Refillable Rat Bait Station, w/ 15 Bait Blocks) to see how things went.These are two very different poisons.*  Bromethalin is a rodenticide (Tom Cat) which poisons the central nervous system, ultimately resulting in increased intracranial pressure, which damages neuronal axons. This damage to the central nervous system causes paralysis, convulsions, and death.  This one, like most, are anticoagulants related to warfarin (the drug called Coumadin). These drugs, eaten by the rodent as an overdose, inhibit vitamin K and lead to a loss of clotting activity over several days (clotting factors require vitamin K). The ultimate result is hemorrhage.So, that being said, you can understand the cautions to your pets or children and these things smell like pet food.  I have been DILIGENT with my dog and I actually carry him past anywhere near this area and put him down on a leash.  All dog exercise is currently at the park until this duty is long over with.The rats do not even bother with the refillable stations.  I have one with the Tom Cat bait and the other with the Ramik pellets and the rats are too smart and seem to know this is a trap.  So I cut the bottoms off a few liter plastic bottles and a few jar lids as little trays as I don't want this stuff directly on the soil.  They still haven't touched the Tom Cat cubes, however, they have DEMOLISHED the Ramik bait.  4lb bag in 4 days!  I was refilling the containers 3+ times per day.  Yesterday, I had first sign of its working.Be prepared for a sight that may be disturbing and heart wrenching at the same time.  It was a rat on my drive early yesterday morning, in convulsions.  Yes, it tormented me and I did what I believe was kind and covered it and gave it a smack with a hammer over the head.  Yes, I cried like a baby, and so I mention this, because if you can't handle this, then just know before you decide.PLEASE be aware that if there are natural predators in your area, such as fox, feral cats, owls, hawks, etc. that these poisoned rats will poison the creature that eats them as well.  I say this as I live in a dense urban setting and we deal with this as an epidemic and I have never seen any predators and, this is probably why it is a problem.  I only pray that what I have done harms no other.Hope this is helpful:)UPDATE 8/26/15 1 star removal:I'm on my 3rd bag of this stuff and the chore of refilling the 6 trays that I have scattered throughout my garden has slowed down tremendously.  However, I have moved over from battling rats to battling mice.  Now, the same concept applies here to mice as well, but what has become a major chore is not refilling the trays but keeping it in the trays.  The rats are large enough to pick up these pellets and eat the whole thing, but the mice are not.  What the mice are doing is dragging these nuggets out of the trays and nibbling on them leaving bits all around the trays on the soil (yuck!) and dragging them to different areas in the garden.  I have to dig up soil and debris around the trays constantly and go hunting very careful for any rogue nuggets that were drug away.  I mention this because it's a pain in the **tt and I have to be double/triple careful with my dog.  I was planning on using these indoors this winter with a chronic mouse issue, but ABSOLUTELY no way I can control where these could end up and it would leave me paranoid for the safety of my dog.  So this winter, I will have to use the Tom Cat indoors because the bait is a larger chunk that was designed to keep the bait inside the bait boxes.  I will just have to frost them with peanut butter to hopefully make them more appetizing to mice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22T5CA09H5RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BUZL2Q#wasThisHelpful","R22T5CA09H5RM","AL5GX3Y4LRHK1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5GX3Y4LRHK1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hold all companies in high regards when their goal to make their money and make a socially responsible footprint doing so.  I received an email from the ""Communications Guru"" of L. and this sentence in the last portion of the email is what got me - ""our ambition to make safe sex a human right!"".This was the body of the company email:""Our condoms are free of harmful chemicals including spermicide, parabens, casein, and glycerin.  These additives are known to cause infections in women, such as UTIs and yeast infections.  Additionally, we have a 90% reduction in proteins in our latex which means that our condoms are thinner, more transparent, and have less of a latex smell and taste.  Our packaging is made out of entirely recycled material and vegetable based inks.  We were awarded ""Best for the World - Overall"" by B Corp.  For context, B Corps are certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency (other B Corps include Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's).  Out of the entire batch of B Corp certified corporations, ours was selected among a dozen others as the highest scoring across all the evaluators.  When we donate, we don't only send condoms - we endorse a thoughtful approach to ensure the most sustainable and long lasting impact.  We support organizations who train women to become healthcare professionals so that they are able to sell the condoms as a source of income.  This gives them the opportunity to become independent as breadwinners in their community thus giving them a larger say in key decision making, such as the use of contraceptive.  We not only want to raise funds to help make safe sex a human right, we aim to empower women both domestically and around the globe.""My company works in health educational products for community outreach.  Mostly with government health departments and nonprofits.  Our largest clientele are within HIV/STD education for high risk youth.  There is a clear misunderstanding that STD's are ""ok"", as you just go to a clinic and get a pill and keep on going.  This as also recently become the case now with HIV prevention and the new Gilead drug that is being hyped - PrEP: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis.  Astonishing to me that we do not encourage simple SELF-CONTROL & RESPONSIBLITY for our own health.ok...Off my soap-box!There are lots of condoms out there, but please consider a company with a cause to empowering people and their sexuality.  Especially women in developing countries!  So, I will say in this review, L., International - THANK YOU!Ps...I have passed these over to some young college students - just in case:)Pss...I would also like to thank this company for including instructions on how to properly use a condom.  You would be surprised how many boys/men don't know.  Please read the instructions and be sure to use them properly to keep safe, it's worth the few minutes to read and even try it out ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5NC5DL8Y0OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GR84C9E#wasThisHelpful","R3R5NC5DL8Y0OB","AL5GX3Y4LRHK1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5GX3Y4LRHK1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned three other Asus laptops, so I'm generally a fan of the brand. But this latest purchase left me disappointed. My last two Asus laptops (two of the same model, just in different colors) were superior to this new model.The screen is dull, grayish, and not as crisp as others I've used. Although it's large, I think it's very disappointing in terms of quality. I've also had many problems networking with other computers and a printer at my office (unclear if that's the fault of the laptop or Windows 10).The biggest complaint I have about this laptop-- and it's a huge complaint-- is that the battery life is absolutely abysmal. It's a joke. I cannot make it through a single day without having to recharge-- and that's with the laptop closed in my suitcase or backpack for about 1/3 of the day. I've tried changing a few ""battery saver"" settings, but it's still horrible. Today-- for example-- I used the laptop plugged in for about six hours. I then used the laptop for about an hour unplugged and-- as I write this review-- I'm now at 43%.

"I'm typically a Fobus fan, but I had trouble finding a holster that would fit a long-slide Glock Gen4 40 in 10mm. This Uncle Mike's holster with the open end fits well, and the price is right. There are a series of offset holes on the back which allow you to adjust somewhat the ride-height and cant. Every position I can think of is available. My only complaint-- and it's a big one-- is that there are two very aggressive teeth on the paddle clip to hold the holster in place, and they are big enough and strong enough to not only make minor adjustments of the holster nearly impossible once mounted on a belt/lip of pants, but I fear the teeth will absolutley destroy nice dress pants over time with wear. I would estimate these teeth are a half-inch long or deep (depending on how you look at them) and they poke through the paddle to aid in belt/pant retention. Anyone who wears something less tough than denim or thick canvas should be cautious though. These teeth are totally overkill, and I'm going to see if I can grind them down with a Dremmel.See the photo for an idea of the size of the teeth and how they stick through the paddle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1834TXM8KPFTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VOIV4M#wasThisHelpful","R1834TXM8KPFTG","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, my box came wrapped in plastic (in other words, it appeared new), but with no packing material.

For example, the four center trays are tiny and it's not clear what they would hold (they aren't suitable for anything other than very short keys or a very small amount of change).","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQY4OO0VTXM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BJ0LU0#wasThisHelpful","RLQY4OO0VTXM6","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This tripod is what it is: A cheap, possibly disposable tripod. I rated it as ""okay"" because it's not necessarily bad, but it's clearly destined for the landfill when (not if, but when) one of the many structural plastic pieces breaks. This tripod doesn't use high-quality polymer or composite components, but rather that thin, brittle, cheap plastic you see on low-quality Chinese products. I assume the target market for this tripod is people traveling who want the option of literally throwing the tripod away after the trip (or not worrying about it if it were lost or stolen during the trip).It works. I'm keeping it. It's a tripod that successfully ""tripods."" But it was of lower quality than I expected given all the reviews.UPDATE: I received a telephone message reportedly from the manufacturer of this tripod who offered a partial refund and also asked that I consider re-writing and re-scoring the review. I appreciate the partial refund, but I think the content of the review is accurate. With the partial refund, the tripod is an even better value, so I'm now rating it as ""I like it.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UO2Q5XE074XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZGN6MY#wasThisHelpful","R1UO2Q5XE074XE","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This grip has so many positive reviews and I love Israeli gear generally, so I took a chance and ordered one.These grips actually ship from Israel and so mine took a month to arrive. The rubber coating on the hard plastic structure of the grip is a good texture: Not too soft, not too hard, and tacky enough for a good grip. The release for the storage compartment is an absolutely silly design that's hard to describe. There's a recessed little cavity (almost too small for a finger) on the back of the grip that you have to poke the tip of your pinky nail into or otherwise use some sort of tool to press the release. As pictured, the grip also features a bold ridge about three-quarters of the way up the grip-- presumably to to separate some of the fingers. This is a personal preference, but I hate such finger grooves or ridges. Let the shooter/operator put his/her fingers wherever they want! I knew going in (based on pictures) that this grip would have that ridge, but I didn't know it'd be as annoying as it is. It doesn't separate the trigger finger (as I thought it would), but rather the middle finger. The placement is strange.For me, the deathblow for this grip-- and the primary reason I returned it-- was that the grip comes with a short Allen-head screw to attach it. For my AK (a milled, very popular, Bulgarian model), the long stock bolt will not work in this new grip. You have to already have-- or be prepared to buy-- a unique and very long Allen wrench to fit inside the length of the grip to use the short Allen bolt that's provided with this new grip. I have no idea why companies that make tactical firearms gear wouldn't use a more common flat-head or Phillips-head screw/bolt (like those that are commonly used on AR-15 grips). It makes swapping grips out in the field or repairs so much easier when you don't require unique tools.This grip didn't work for me, but your mileage may vary.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8FYGMU6CP7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6XH8FO#wasThisHelpful","R1R8FYGMU6CP7X","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several digital/computer/smartphone calendars I juggle for my business and personal matters, they all work great, and they are generally superior to written calendars (e.g. they are backed up automatically, can be easily shared, can be viewed on multiple devices, and are easy to update). However, a laminated calendar like this where you can see everything at once is really nice. The boxes are too small to really write a lot of details, but this is a ""big picture review"" or ""long-term planning"" calendar in my opinion (that's why I bought it at least).The only minor comments I'd make about the calendar's quirks are that it's rather wide (so make sure you know WHERE you're going to hang it), comes unframed (so think about HOW you're going to hang it), and has a slight curl to it (because it's shipped rolled up tight).

When you intend to use these in a professional office, you don't want to be worried that one (or both) of your monitors are going to completely fail.This is covered in other reviews, but important to mention: These adapters do not appear to have any actual graphics processing power.

"It works as described, but with a couple of issues:- The bottom of the stand is a sort of powder-coated metal with a somewhat abrasive finish. There is absolutely no felt or soft coating on the bottom of the stand so it will scratch and damage any wood surface you put it on. Even if the monitor is stationary most of it's entire life, there will be some movement of the stand to when adjusting the angle of the screen, so scratches to the desk or desktop will be inevitable if something soft isn't placed below the stand.- Adjusting for height is not an easy operation. Rather than using knobs or wing nuts (which could be loosened and tightened with fingers), the engineers/designers who built this stand made it require tools to loosen or tighten the screws that clamp the main vertical pole. This means the height cannot easily be adjusted.- Adjusting for tilt or angle is not an easy operation either. Again, rather than using knobs or wing nuts (which could be loosened and tightened with fingers), the engineers/designers who built this stand made it require tools to loosen or tighten the screws that clamp the plate around the ball-joint. This means the angle or tilt of the stand cannot easily be adjusted. There is a *small* bit of adjustment that can be made if you find the sweet spot when tightening the Allen screws *just enough* that it allows for enough friction to hold the monitor upright but not *too much* so that it prevents slight adjustments.Bottom line: This is a decent stand at a good price, but you need to apply felt at the bottom to prevent scratching, and nearly any adjustments will require an Allen wrench.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YDKVG1Q8VH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTWO5B2#wasThisHelpful","R15YDKVG1Q8VH5","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this keyboard to use with a Lenovo Yoga 10 HD tablet, and-- to the keyboard's credit-- it paired in seconds and seems to work well with the tablet. However, the keyboard is unimpressive for a number of reasons:- It feels very cheap. Something about the plastic, it looks very glossy, and more like a toy than a business device. And while devices should be functional vs. fashionable, this one just doesn't match the quality of most tablets.- The backlit keys are cool looking, but not very functional. The backlighting is primarily visible around the keys (where there's translucent plastic}, but the actual printing remains mostly unlit and is really uneven from key to key (especially in red). Another thing that's not really the fault of the keyboard, but interesting to note: If you're using this anywhere near your actual tablet, the tablet will light up the keyboard. I found that the backlit keys weren't nearly as big of a feature for this keyboard than I thought they'd be. They are very pretty when you change the colors, but that's about it.- Lastly, but most importantly for me, the keys are too loud. Super-loud. I would drive anyone at a business conference or meeting absolutely crazy if I were to type on this while in their presence. It's just too damn loud. CLICK CLACK CLICK CLACK! I have three different computers, and none of them have keyboards this loud.+ On the positive side, the keyboard is very inexpensive, comes with a soft carrying case, and appears to work with all three device types (Windows, Android, and iOS).Unforuntatley, overall, the keyboard just won't work for me.

"Very cool. Better than expected. No wires, no cables, no switches. Just mount it, aim it, and forget it. I even like the color (it's kind of got a pearlescent cream color)Some of the reviews said the light was dim (wrong, it's quite bright) or that the motion sensor didn't work (mine works great). My only criticism of the light is that it uses three D batteries and that's an odd number (literally) given than most packs come in four. The light will hopefully last a year (or more), so you're going to have a few single D batteries laying around unless you plan ahead and buy a 12 pack (the lowest common denominator). I know, I know, that's a dumb thing to get worked up over, but I don't understand why they didn't just make it use four D batteries or four C batteries. It's like these damn tv remotes today that use one single AAA battery. Where do you get one single AAA battery!? By the time you replace the battery in the remote, you go digging through a drawer full of expired or past-their-prime single AAA batteries.

"I bought the audio version of this book because I'm an OK Cupid user, and I've followed the OK Cupid blog. OK Cupid-- by being one of the most popular dating sites in the world-- has collected an enormous amount of data from it's users. Data which is very intimate, personal, and unique because it is information that can be analyzed in order to determine patterns or draw conclusions. However, Rudder does an absolute hack job in interpreting the data and it's painful to listen to him attempt to play alchemist or voodoo witch doctor. It's as if he's never taken a single class in the fields of logic, statistics, or psychology. Google ""spurious correlations"" by Tyler Vigen, and you'll get a good overview of the problems when people doesn't understand correlation vs. causation. Rudder also completely fails to take into account (even in the subtitle of the book) that users on OK Cupid are typically answering questions publicly so it is a mistake to assume that all self-reported answers are accurate and candid. Also, many of the questions on OK Cupid are broad unscientific questions, compound questions, or allow very restricted responses in the form of multiple-choice answers (many of which are casual/informal and don't allow for the ideal and most accurate response).I don't mean to dump on the author, but there is one more strong criticism of Rudder's choice of topics for this book: When he spends a third of the book discussing Google searches and Twitter, it's like watching one of those pathetic interviews with a retired ball player who's asked how the college team needs to win (duh, they need to score more points and prevent the other team from scoring point). By this, I mean that he has no insight at all, no private or proprietary information, and he simply talks about popular Google search terms, what Twitter is, how popular it is, the volume of tweets, and the most common tweeted words or phrases, and he then makes wild conclusions based on such little information. He'd be better off sticking to what he knows-- or has the potential to know-- and that is how people behave and answer questions on OK Cupid.Given the economic value of the data collected, Ok Cupid will likely never turn over the bulk of the data for academic review or peer-review. That's a shame, because it'd be the only way to really learn anything from the data (and to get a book or journal article that is better than this book). So we're stuck with this book. I will say there were just enough nuggets of interesting material in here to make it worth a loan from the library or to borrow from a friend, but I'd say the ratio was a half hour of good material in seven hours of audio (again, I had the audio CDs of this book). It really is awful to have to sit through hours of complete nonsense (nonsense that is deliberately package-wrapped to sound like legitimate science) just to get a few interesting pieces of information, but if you're an OK Cupid user, it might be worth it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADILQ6HLN0NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553397494#wasThisHelpful","R3ADILQ6HLN0NL","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I carefully read a number of reviews of this unit, a more expensive American-made classic version (which the makers of this cheaper Chinese model apparently ripped off) and also a digital/electronic (as opposed to mechanical) white noise maker.What I like:+ The mechanical noise is superior (to my ears) to digital recreations. I've tried sound/noise makers with recordings, and they always sound very phony and of poor quality. Some noise makers with sounds of beaches and rain or forests are so bad that the awful imitations are a distraction.+ By twisting the top of this unit, you can dial-in the sound you're looking for. Pitch changes a bit, and so does the volume.+ The unit does what it's supposed to do. It creates a nice, neutral, white noise.+ The unit is inexpensive.What I don't like:-The foam on the bottom is very, very cheap looking and I suspect it will get torn off or chewed up if you transport or travel a lot with the unit. Not a huge issue for me, but travelers be forewarned.- Contrary to a few reviews I read, this unit is loud. In a small office, I have to keep the unit on low, with the top dialed in the medium-sized vents, or it's simply too loud. With the unit on high and dialed-in using the large vents, the noise is actually hysterical: It sounds like you're in a tent during a mountain wind storm in Nepal. Or maybe strapped to the wing of a 747 at altitude. I can't image you'd ever leave this unit on maximum settings unless you lived in the ghetto and were attempting to mask the sound of drive-by shootings.- The unit has a definite mechanical sound. It's not all wind or white noise. I'd say it's similar to an aquarium pump or the motor on a fridge. It's subtle, but it's definitely there (more so than in a regular good-quality fan). On the absolute lowest settings, it's a bit bothersome. On the mid-to-higher settings, the white noise is greater than the motor sound so it's not a deal-breaker for me.Bottom line:The price of this unit makes it too good to pass up. It's an easy choice and, while I hate to admit it, it was the main reason I bought this unit over the nicer original/classic that was nearly four-times the cost. Even with it's shortcomings, it's a good white noise maker, I'm keeping it, and I'm satisfied with the purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17AM875TAAOQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFSF402#wasThisHelpful","R17AM875TAAOQB","A3TBMAWIIHKHFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TBMAWIIHKHFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In summary, both have been great and I would recommend either, as long as you understand the limitations and downsides to an indoor portable air conditioner (primarily noise and reduced efficiency vs. window/wall unit).I originally purchased the ARC-14 last year to cool my 22' x 24' insulated garage because I had several servers running in the garage, but I have since consolidated machines and moved everything in my office--so I have more computer heat in addition to the summer heat.  So this year I am trying the ARC-14 in my office.  I only need air conditioning from June to September, and I only need to cool my home office, so a portable unit works well, is inexpensive, and I can store it out of the way in the garage during the winter.This unit is physically larger and has noticeably more cooling capacity than the ARC-12SD.  Last summer I used the 12SD in my home office, which is about 12' x 15'.  The 12SD did a decent job, but it would run for quite a while before it could cool the room from 82 to 78 degrees--perhaps 45 minutes.The ARC-14S is definitely more powerful, and the difference is noticeable in my office.  The room cools much quicker, and the compressor therefore shuts off sooner.  The ARC-14 seems to easily bring the temp down to 76 degrees in my office.However, the downside is that the ARC-14S seems noticeably louder in my office.  The compressor is lower frequency, but the combined compressor + fan noise just 3 feet away is loud enough that I wear Bose QuietComfort headphones to cancel out the noise.  I have laminate floors and a minimally furnished office, so there is no sound deadening.  In my carpeted living room, the ARC-14 doesn't seem as loud.  Just like the ARC-12, a lot of noise comes from the air flowing through the two hoses, so I put a large folded bath towel over the top of both the hoses, which dramatically reduces the high frequency noise.Aside from that, the other con is that this unit does not have a drain port to constantly drain the water.  Whynter says that this model does not need it--while that may technically be true, and the unit may run fine and not collect enough water to shut off, I found there is a downside.When the ARC-14 first runs and brings the room down from 82 degrees to 77 degrees, the relative humidity drops to 45 percent.  But when the compressor stops and only the fan runs, the humidity rises to 60 percent.  The room feels more humid.  So I'm wondering if the accumulated water in the unit is potentially adding moisture back into the room when the compressor turns off.While writing this review, I just watched the humidity read 60% when the compressor was off, and now that the compressor is running, the humidity reading dropped from 60% down to 51%.  So there are significant swings in humidity that I don't recall having with the ARC-12.I need to do some testing with the ARC-14 vs. the ARC-12 with a drain hose to see if constantly draining the water makes any difference with the room humidity.But if you have a room larger than 150 - 200 sq feet and you want faster cooling, I would still recommend the ARC-14 over the ARC-12.  The larger compressor makes a big difference.  When I researched portable and window AC units, the BTU recommendations seemed too low.  For instance, the Home Depot web site recommends 12,000 BTUs for a 400 sq ft room, which is completely unrealistic based on my experience.  If such a room is not fully enclosed and doesn't have great insulation, I know I wouldn't be satisfied with the ARC-12 in a room that large.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UDNH5BJ1295/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028AYQDC#wasThisHelpful","R21UDNH5BJ1295","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have previously used suction-cup style phone holders, but my new 4Runner doesn't have a single flat surface on the dash for a suction cup, so I purchased this cup holder model.It works well, with a few very minor caveats.1. The plastic pieces in the base that expand to keep it tight in the cup holder are soft plastic, so they deform when they are tight.  It is holding just fine for now, but I don't know if this will be an issue over time.2. The clips at the bottom and sides hold my iPhone very securely.  But I have to squeeze the side clips very tight to get that last click, to make it snug on my iPhone 6.  Doing this every time I get in my car is getting annoying.  I may trim some of the rubber off the side pads to reduce the pressure a little.3. One of the rubber pads on the side clips fell off after less than two weeks.  I reattached it, but it just fell off again when I had the car washed and found it on the ground outside the car.  So I put a few drops of super glue on each pad and reattached it, so I'll see if the superglue will hold.Other than the downside of using up one of my two cup holders, this works very well and seems well designed.  Exactly what I was looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HBA57JDB5CHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GNNH3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1HBA57JDB5CHP","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While sitting in slow traffic on an Los Angeles freeway several years ago, an old Honda sedan started driving erratically and suddenly swerved across four lanes of traffic, right in front of me, with people frantically climbing out of the car, in the middle of the freeway, as the car was still moving.  I was very puzzled.  The car rolled into the barrier wall on the right side of the freeway as smoke started to pour out of the car.  Ahhh, that explained the circus act I just saw.At the time, I didn't have a fire extinguisher, so there was nothing I could do, and fortunately the people all got out of the car before it caught on fire.I've been meaning to get one ever since, and finally purchased this extinguisher to put in a new car I just purchased.  I haven't had a need to use it, so I can't yet comment on the effectiveness of the extinguisher, but the size is great.  I just kept it in the box, which tucks perfectly in a storage area in the back of my 4Runner.  Hopefully I'll never need to use it, but having seen a few car fires in LA, I know it does happen, so I'm happy to have an extinguisher around just in case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYMYLZDDU4U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H4RK4O#wasThisHelpful","R1WYMYLZDDU4U7","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought a pair of these about 5 years ago from a local retailer.  I loved them and wore them for everything from gardening to moving furniture to hauling trash.  My wife even loves them and wears them instead of the woman-sized gardening gloves I bought for her.  After 5 years of solid use and abuse, including water, they are finally falling apart.  A finger has a hole and the leather is worn thin.I bought these on Amazon hoping they would be the same, but unfortunately they are slightly different and don't fit as well as my old ones.First, these are noticeably smaller.  My old gloves are Medium and are not tight at all, and I don't recall them being tight or snug when I first bought them.  The new ones are slightly tight and my fingers solidly touch the ends  of the fingers in the glove.  And they added some additional padding to the palm of the glove, which while nice in concept, makes the glove thicker, making the fit tighter and making it a little harder to feel and grip with the gloves.While I think the design and materials are great, the Medium size is now slightly too small for me.  I'm still reaching for my old worn out pair instead of using these new ones.I'm going to try a Large and see how they fit.UPDATE:  Despite the slightly small size, I started using the gloves for gardening work. I found that when they become damp, the fingers seem to stretch out and become more comfortable.  I suspect that my old pair stretched quite a bit over the years, so I am going to try and break these in a little more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFG7D96X9OJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLYXC0O#wasThisHelpful","R2BFG7D96X9OJ9","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After trying several different impromptu methods for setting up a single iPad so that two kids could watch a movie on a long drive, I finally broke down and bought this.  Given the limitations of car interiors, it seems like a good solution that will work with most / all cars.It is a bit weird to install and fit the first time, but once you see how the pieces work and adjust, it's a simple process to install or remove.It is fairly light weight construction, so I'm not sure how it will hold up over several years or potential roughness from the kids, but the design seems sound and I was able to adjust it and tighten everything down so that the iPad was very secure, didn't shake, and didn't tilt.What is very nice is that it's easy enough to install and remove that I don't feel the need to keep it in the car.

"I was thrilled when I saw this DeWalt track router adapter.  I used to hate routing dados.  I don't have a table saw, so I have had to use my DeWalt router for dados.  I tried one of those ""exact width"" dado jigs, but it was very tedious to use.  I then tried a simple straight edge, but that is also tedious if you need a dado that is slightly wider than your router bit.  And when the router jumped or I wasn't applying pressure properly, the router would move off the straight edge slightly, messing up the dado.I own some Festool tools, so I looked into the Festool router + track solution, but the price of the total solution is absolutely insane.  I don't use a router nearly enough to justify that type of expense.And then I saw this track router adapter and I was thrilled.  The price for this adapter is dirt cheap by Festool standards, and the price for the DeWalt track is also very reasonable.  I bought both right away.I used the router adapter to cut dados in a plywood cabinet that I was building.  I marked the locations of the dados, set down the track, did some learning and fiddling to figure out where the track needs to be to get my bit in the right location, and then did a dry run, sliding the router across the width of the board to make sure it moved smoothly.  After adjusting the tensioning knobs and getting things dialed in, I turned on the power and gently pushed the router across the track.  The dados were absolutely perfect.  Perfectly straight and perfectly clean.  What a huge improvement over the jig and straight edge methods.  So much simpler, easier, and the results were unbeatable.Out of the box, the adapter may not slide smoothly on the track--Festool products can be the same way.  I put a little bit of Renaissance wax on the track and it made the adapter move much easier and smoother.  And the knobs and adjustments on this adapter are a bit odd and not nearly as refined and easy to adjust as a Festool design, but the two rods were very stable and once you figure out how to set it up for your router and workpiece, it works well enough.I also purchased the DeWalt track clamps. They aren't fancy, but they work well with the track.If dados are a hassle for you and you want an easier solution, I highly recommend this adapter and the DeWalt track.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QCB7D7657K5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J38N9W#wasThisHelpful","R2QCB7D7657K5M","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was skeptical of this trimmer, but given the tedious alternatives, I thought I would try it.While it is far from perfect, it is the best option I've found so far for trimming edge banding.  I found using a utility knife to be too tedious and inconsistent, especially on long boards.  A block plane was similarly tedious.  I only have a full size router, so I'm not about to use that for trimming.This tool does a fairly good job at trimming the bulk of the edge banding.  The challenge I have is getting consistent results.  Sometimes it produces a perfect cut and leaves a clean edge.  Other times I just can't get it to clean up an overhanging edge no matter how many passes I made.  I don't yet know if it is position, pressure, or something else.The one limitation is that if you have to use it on an intersection, it can't cut the final 1-2"".  Not a big deal, but if you have a cabinet with several dado shelves, all of which are edge banded, it is tedious cleaning up that last piece on each side of the shelf.Despite these limitations, I have found it better than the alternatives.

I am now resigned to using only dedicated countersinks.This Bosch countersink is obviously solid and strong, does not wobble, and appears to be well made, but the results are not very polished.  On plywood, the hole is not smooth--it seems to produce a ""faceted"" circle, which surprised me.  Apparently some people call it ""chattering"".  And the top edge of the countersink often wasn't clean--sometimes the veneer fibers would stick out around the hole like fuzz.But I will say that this countersink is relatively easy to control--it doesn't suddenly plunge into the wood like the DeWalt ones often would.

"I am puzzled by all of the positive reviews of this coupler set.  I installed them on a new hose and blow gun and they leaked like crazy.  It was a constant large leak--not just when I moved the tool or angled the hose.The problem appears to be with the male connectors. All of them leak constantly when used with the included female connector.  The machining of the ""ridge"" appears to be slightly out of spec, causing the male connectors to leak with certain female connectors, including the Tekton female connector. The male connector doesn't leak when connected to my compressor, but it leaks with other female connectors.They look well made, but the leaking is so bad that they are unusable for me.The morning after posting this review, Tekton customer service posted a reply and they offered to send me a new set.  They certainly aren't making any money at this point by having to replace an $8 product, so the customer service is very impressive.  If you have any issues with their tools, try contacting them at support@tektontools.com.UPDATE: I received the replacement set yesterday, and they have the same problem.  The male connectors are unusable.  The female connector seems okay, and the threaded male coupler is okay, but all three male connectors leak.

"While this DeWalt guide does work and you can get basic jobs done, the design has some flaws, and mine has a quality issue.When I first tested it on some scrap, it seemed great.  But only after using it on some real cuts did I see the flaws.First, while I appreciate the vacuum adapter, it got in the way, preventing me from making my full dados.  Fortunately, the plastic adapter can be removed, and in the case of my dado, it wouldn't help anyway.The second issue is with the single point of attachment to the black metal ""base"".  If you look at the photo, you'll see the thumbscrew in the center of the gray metal piece.  That is the only thing that is maintaining the position of the fence relative to the router.  While it has a fine adjustment knob, the threads on my knob didn't mesh with the threads in the gray metal bracket, so I could barely turn it, and I could see the threads getting flattened out.Using the fine adjustment knob became very frustrating, so I ended up using trial and error to get close.I would agree with the other reviewers that this is not a precision accessory.  If you do not need exact placement, it will probably work fine.  But if you need to have even 1/16"" of precision and have to change the position several times during your project, I suspect you will be as frustrated and disappointed as me.If I need a router edge guide again, I will try the Bosch model recommended by another reviewer.  I don't think I'll bother to use this one again, unless it is for a project that doesn't require any precision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DY8XY2D1J8QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002232W#wasThisHelpful","R1DY8XY2D1J8QK","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this to replace a Penguino 7,500 BTU single hose portable unit that I bought used from a friend.  While the Penguino worked okay, it could barely cool a small 10x12 bedroom.  It would blow cold air and pump out very hot air through the exhaust hose, but the compressor ran constantly and it just never seemed to be able to cool the room with me and a few computers in it.I recently moved to a house that is older, has less insulation, and where my office has two 4' x 5' windows.  I knew the Penguino wouldn't cut it.  While the recommended BTU guidelines say that 12,000 BTU is overkill for my new 11x17 office, I didn't want something under powered, and I wanted to be able to move the unit to the living room, garage, or sun room and have it handle those rooms as well.After learning about dual hose portable AC units, I ordered this Whynter from Amazon based on the generally positive reviews.  When I received it, I let it sit in the box upright for a full 24 hours just to make sure that the compressor was happy.I then got it setup, got the hoses connected, plugged it in, and....nothing.  No lights, no sounds, no power, nothing.  The buttons on the front didn't do anything, and while the remote LCD display worked, the remote didn't turn the unit on either.  I triple checked the plug and reset it to make sure that it wasn't tripped.  I double checked my outlets, checked the voltage on the outlets, and even verified that there was electricity going up the cord using a non-contact voltage detector.  All seemed fine with my electricity.I called customer support, but they were closed since it was Sunday, so I left a VM and then emailed support.  They called me on Monday and explained that it was likely the cable to the display panel on the front of the unit.  They said that they have found that during shipping, the cable apparently gets disconnected.  They emailed me some instructions on how to open up the unit, remove the back and front cover, and check the cable.  I opened it up, and sure enough, the cable had fallen out.  I would hope that since they know about this issue that they will use a piece of tape or glue on future production runs to fix this issue.While plugging the cable back into the front display panel, I noticed that it had been pinched under the front cover, and this had ripped the insulation and exposed the wires.  I emailed a photo of the damaged cable to support, and the next day they shipped out a replacement cable and new display circuit board.  Two days later those parts arrived, I installed them, and got everything reassembled.  I then plugged it in and immediately heard a beep.  I turned it on and the front panel lit up.  The compressor kicked in, and cool air quickly started flowing.  All fixed.While that process took about a week to get through, I thought the customer service was very good.  They knew my problem as soon as I described it, sent me instructions so that I could fix it myself, and then sent me new parts.  It generally took a day to receive each reply, but they were responsive and helpful.  Some customers might not be comfortable taking apart the unit, but I didn't mind doing the fixes at all, as it was a lot easier than having to re-pack and return the unit.Now that I have it working, I like it, but it does have some fundamental drawbacks.  The drawbacks aren't necessarily the fault of this particular product, but rather the inherent challenges with portable AC units.While the compressor on this Whynter unit is quieter than the noisy clanky compressor on the Penguino, the Whynter generates quite a bit of noise when running.  The noise seems to be coming mostly from the fan and air flow of the exhaust hose.  Once the unit cools the room and temporarily drops into fan only mode, there is a huge drop in noise.Using two iPhone apps, I'm measuring about 70dB about 5 feet away from the unit in my office.  While 70 dB isn't necessarily ""loud"", the constant white noise and frequency of the sound feels very loud and is actually fatiguing in my office, which is currently sparsely decorated, so there is probably lots of sound reflection making it sound even louder.  It feels similar to being on a passenger airplane, but not quite as loud.  Fortunately I have some Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones that I can wear--otherwise I would want ear plugs.  If you have a larger carpeted room with less noise reflection and can position the unit farther away from you, it would help.The Whynter is able to easily cool my 11x17 office from 84 degrees to 76 degrees and have the compressor shut off for several minutes before it turns on again.  That's pretty good compared to my old AC unit, especially considering the poor insulation and large windows in my new house.As for the dual hose design, while it may be more efficient than a single hose unit, the down side is that the hoses are very large, bulky, unsightly, and tedious to setup and position.  You basically can't put the unit closer than 2 feet from the window since the hoses are so large and stiff.  The larger hoses are obviously more efficient, but the downside is the appearance and bulk.  There is no hiding this thing.As for draining the water, I haven't yet dealt with that, but I'm okay with having to rig something up if necessary.  I'm going to call Whynter to ask about the ""upper drain port"" in the middle of the back of the unit to see if that can have a hose attached instead of having to fight with the bottom drain.The unit is relatively compact and light compared to my old air conditioner.  The plastic body and frame make it much lighter than a metal design, and it's smaller overall than the 7,500 BTU Penguino.Overall I'm happy with the unit so far.  I will probably only use it 3 months of the year for summer here in the Los Angeles area, so I'm hoping to be able to tuck it away in a closet during the rest of the year.UPDATE 1 - NOISE REDUCTION: After three days of running, the noise was frustratingly loud, so I tried to see if I could reduce the noise.  My impression is that there is a significant amount of noise just from the air flow out of the exhaust hose.  So I grabbed a large shower towel, folded it in quarters, laid it over the first foot of hoses, and immediately I noticed an improvement.  I then just covered the exhaust hose, and that was what reduced the sound. It doesn't dramatically reduce the overall volume, but it significantly reduces the highest frequency of the noise which is what was bothering me the most.I'm now going to look into some kind of hack to neatly wrap the exhaust hose with a towel or insulation to see if that works.  The one possible downside might be that by insulating the exhaust hose, it increases the temperature of the plastic hose and causes it to degrade faster.  But given my office layout, I need to try and quiet it down, so I'm okay with that consequence.UPDATE 2 - UPPER DRAIN PORT: On the back of the unit, near the middle, there is an additional plastic cap that holds a rubber stopper, which goes into a plastic port on the unit.  The instruction manual calls this the ""Upper Drain Port"", and later mentions in ""Dehumidifying Mode"" that it can be used for ""continuous drainage"".  I called Whynter customer service (866-949-6837) and the woman who answered confirmed that it can be used for continuous draining of the unit rather than the lower drain plug.I don't know if this is a new feature, but for all the people complaining about having to lift or tilt the unit to drain it, locate the ** Upper Drain Port ** on the back and give it a try.Unfortunately, despite the manual saying that ""a garden hose"" can be used for this port, the male threads on the port do not match my standard garden hose threads.  The diameter is correct, but the threads are slightly different, so I can only get a few turns before the threads tighten up. But it looks like it should be possible to rig up a piece of tubing and gasket that will work to allow draining outside or into a bucket.UPDATE 3 - WATER DRAIN SOLUTION: I went to Home Depot and found some parts to make a simple and effective water draining solution for the Upper Drain Port that uses gravity, no pump required.Here are the parts and the Home Depot SKU numbers, which cost about $13.3/4 Sch 40 PVC threaded female-female coupling (SKU 610798)Watts 5/8"" ID x 3/4"" MIP Nylon Hose Barb with 90 degree elbow (SKU 558915)Watts 3/4"" OD, 5/8"" ID x 10 ft. Clear Vinyl Tubing (SKU 702554)Optional: HDX 2 1/2 quart plastic All Purpose Mixing Container and lid (by the orange buckets at HD)The threads on the PVC coupling aren't exactly the same as either the Whynter drain port, or the Watts Hose Barb, but since there is no pressure involved, it works well enough.  Just be gentle and don't over tighten it.First, remove the plastic cap and rubber cork from the Upper Drain Port on the back of the unit (be ready for water to pour out), then gently thread the PVC coupling on to the drain port.  Then thread the plastic hose barb into the PVC coupling, pointing it downwards.  Then cut a piece of the clear vinyl tubing and attach it to the hose barb (I used about 15"").  Point the hose into a container or bucket, and you are all set.This morning I had collected about 20 ounces of water after running for a few hours.UPDATE: August 2015: This AC unit has been working great this summer.  Over the winter, I had new windows installed and insulation blown into the exterior walls, so that has greatly improved the home office where I use this unit.  Although it does make a fair amount of noise, It is definitely quieter than the larger ARC-14 and does a good job for my office. Today it is 98 degrees and it is working very hard to keep the room temp at 78.  It has been running continuously, but is holding the temp steady. When I first used it this summer, after it had sat in the garage all winter, it did act a little funny, with the compressor not turning on for several minutes, but after that first day of use, it has been working fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2191U2R8LZ3A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MQBYYU#wasThisHelpful","R2191U2R8LZ3A8","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why, oh why, did I not buy this type of drip-free caulk gun years ago?I foolishly thought that all caulk guns were the same, so when the guy at Home Depot handed me their $3 model, I didn't think twice.  I must have wiped up a half gallon of caulk that kept oozing out of the tube even after I had stopped pulling the handle and even released the plunger.The reduced waste alone is enough to justify the price of this type of caulk gun.

"This switch works well, but what I didn't notice when I bought it was that it requires the use of a wireless ""canopy"" unit, which is included in the package for this model.I needed to replace a mechanical slider wall switch for my ceiling fan.  The switch box had been wired with an extra wire to use a hard-wired controller, so that's what I thought I was buying with this Lutron.  I was hoping to avoid having to climb up to the fan and wire in a canopy controller.Unfortunately, the canopy controller is required for this unit, so rather than return it, I just got on the ladder and installed the wireless unit on the fan.  The installation was easier than I expected, since my fan mount had enough room for the controller and wires.  I'm no electrician, but following the instructions, the installation was simple and relatively easy.  I just capped off my extra wire at the switch and at the fan, and was able to easily connect the other wires.The switch works great and I'm happy that I kept it.  It is much better than the ""mechanical"" slider switch that it replaced--the metal contacts on the slider switches burn and eventually start sizzling, so I prefer this solid state design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L01S11TMJDLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MOIDA8#wasThisHelpful","R1L01S11TMJDLN","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I absolutely love the dust collection capability of the UDD 2, there is a serious static electricity problem with ""version 1"" and even ""version 2"" of this product.  If you buy, make sure you get the latest version with black cyclone or request the newer parts from Oneida.What I call ""Version 1"" did not have any conductive material on the translucent cyclone.  After a few Festool vacuums got fried, they realized they had a problem.In ""Version 2"" they added 1/2"" strips of metallic tape to the cyclone and plastic hose connectors that they claimed had been ""independently tested and verified"" to connect to the vacuum ground to dissipate static electricity.  In my experience, this tape did not work well--I tested it and found that the overlapping layers of tape did not have conductivity.While using my Version 2 UDD, I was zapped repeatedly by static electricity whenever my TS55 hose touched my arm. Not comforting when pushing a saw through wood.  I called Oneida customer service and the woman basically ignored what I said, saying only that the UDD had been tested by a third party and that nothing was wrong with the product.  She emailed me the updated instructions, that did NOT come with my UDD, that had some additional brief instructions on how to make sure the metallic tape and other anti-static hacks were setup properly to avoid static discharge issues.  I reset every connection and had to use a piece of tape to connect a wire to the UDD box (since their instructions didn't relate to the CT26 at all, and there was no extra metallic tape to follow their instructions).  After that, I haven't been shocked again, thankfully, but I would not recommend Version 2 of the product to anyone.They have since released what I call a ""Version 3"", which has the black cyclone.  It looks like they may also have designed a new hose for the cyclone to get rid of the hacked together hose connector.  To their credit, I just received a letter from them today saying they are offering the new components at no charge.  FINALLY.The problem is that until you open the box, you will not know which version you purchased.  But if you do get the translucent cyclone or older parts, you can request the newer parts.They have a form on their web site to order the parts:www (dot) oneida-air (dot) com / udd-partsOr call them at 866-387-8822One last critical point:  If you use the UDD on a Festool vacuum, you void your Festool warranty.  Oneida states this loudly and clearly somewhere in their updated documentation or on their web site.  Obviously Festool is not enamored with their product and the fried circuit boards it has apparently caused.  I didn't know about voiding the warranty until well after I had started using the UDD.With that very significant gripe complete, I will say that the dust collection is phenomenal.  I have zero reservations shoving my Festool CT26 hose into a giant pile of wood chips and saw dust.  It sucks them up, they spin in the cyclone, and then are dropped into the box without loading up the vacuum.The UDD box plus cyclone on top of the CT26 does make it pretty large and bulky, so I wouldn't recommend it if you regularly transport your vacuum--it would be a pain to take off and put back on repeatedly.  But it works fine for my garage and is much more convenient and space saving then a separate cyclone or dust collection device.  I was considering getting the standard ""bucket"" style Dust Deputy, but the guy at Woodcraft pointed out that I'd have to drag the bucket everywhere with the vacuum.  I'm glad he made that point--the UDD is very convenient to roll around on top of the vacuum.Once I get my ""Version 3"" parts, I will see if they have done a better job with fit and finish and if they have properly addressed the static issue.UPDATE: August 2014:  I received the Anti Static ""Retrofit Kit"" from Oneida that includes the black anti-static cyclone. I swapped out the cyclone, added the mesh wire straps to the clips on the dust collection box, and took out my digital multi-meter to verify conductivity between all of the parts and from the hose to the grounding pin on the vacuum plug.While I now finally showed conductivity for all of the Dust Deputy parts, the one item that did not have full conductivity was actually the Festool hose that came with my TS55.  The  hose material itself was conductive, and the large plastic connector to the vacuum was conductive, but oddly, there was no conductivity between the hose and the connector.  So I got conductivity between the ground prong on the plug all the way to where the hose connects to the cyclone, but then there was a gap from the hose connector to the hose itself.  This isn't Oneida's fault, and I'm surprised that the Festool hose didn't have full conductivity.To address this, I got a 2 foot piece of standard copper electrical wire and removed the insulation (or you could use the bare ground wire from some Romex).  I looped one end of the wire a few times around the Festool hose by the cyclone, putting the wire in the corrugated channel in the hose.  I then wrapped the other end of the wire around the top vertical port on the cyclone a few times.  With that wire connection between the Festool hose and the cyclone, I now get full conductivity from the end of the vacuum hose to the ground prong on the plug.I'm now, finally, happy with ""Rev 3"" of the Ultimate Dust Deputy II.  Given that I've tested and verified the conductivity of all of the parts and the entire vacuum, I'm not particularly worried about static electricity.As long as you are comfortable personally verifying the conductivity of the entire solution, and utilizing the ""copper wire"" hack to ensure conductivity with the Festool hose, I think it is now a good solution.Upgrading my review to 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XO978NLINJB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VR65OE#wasThisHelpful","R1XO978NLINJB4","A216CBON6HHOJS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A216CBON6HHOJS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you own an apple product you know all too well how many charging cords we go through.

"I’ve battled acne all my life. I am also looking for something to replace my current face wash that contains benzoyl peroxide, which dries out my face. I use it because it seemed to be the only thing that worked.I’ve currently been using the Relogy 2 part system and a bonus pore exfoliating cleansers which doesn’t contain any benzoyl peroxide but 0.5% salicylic acid. Step one is a foaming cleanser. I use 2 pumps for my entire face with warm water, followed by cold water to rinse and close my pores back up. I use this with the kongac sponge which is all natural. Step 2 is the skin balancing lotion with coconut milk. It comes in a pump which I love, there is no contamination with opening and closing a tub. I only use 1 pump for my entire face and it smells so good just like coconut. It keeps my face hydrated without being shiny. Allow it to dry completely before applying makeup. It doesn’t affect my makeup application. I use the pore cleansing exfoliating scrub once a week. It has tiny micro beads that deep cleanses the skin. I only use it once a week because over using sometimes causes break out. Don’t scrubs hard the micro beads will do the work and just let the water do the work when rinsing off.

When I tried plugging the charger in the board I looked at the prongs and the holes on the charger and when I plugged it in it didn’t fit. I immediately contacted them thinking it didn’t work and they emailed me back to help me.

You can look at this 2 ways. 1 I need to read instructions or 2 they need to make the plug the same way it is on the board, buy after reading the instructions its clear in the picture that I had it wrong. If you’re like me and don’t read instructions and what to blame someone else before getting the right information, READ INSTURCTIONS.After I charged it for a few hours it was fully charged and ready to go. The on button is that a bottom. Once on it lights up and ready to go. I was able to zoom around the house and walking the dog is a breeze. I love the lights in the front, now the lights come on when turned on and when you have your foot on each side. If you have no experience on skateboards, wake boarding or any type of recreational sport that requires balancing it will take a little time getting use to. I personal don’t so it has taken me over a week to get on without falling, but my fiancé is into wake and snow boarding it took him all of 10 seconds to figure it out. Even though it’s not Bluetooth which personal I like because I don’t want to hear his music while he’s riding.Overall we love this thing and I’m planning on buying more for the entire family.

"I have super long hair and love a tight curl. The Xtava spiral curl is something that takes getting use to. When you turn it on it there is just one no temperature setting of any kind, no high, medium or low. On the instructions it says it goes up to 400F.I don’t suggest taking big sections of hair at a time. From my experience you need to do small sections at a time. If you have long hair past your bra line, you will find that this curling want will only get the tips. This is really meant for medium to shorter length hair. It does give a beach wave look.It is time consuming because you have to do little sections at a time, but it is well worth it. The curls are beautiful. Just like anything else practice makes perfect. I do recommend it for medium length hair or shorter but for us long hair woman, it will only really get the ends.The few things I would change would be temperature options. Whether it be high, medium and low or setting a your own degree.

"Every day I can count on my dog barking at all the hummingbirds in our yard. The kit comes with everything you need to start with including great instructions. The top of the feeder is a bright red cap with a yellow flower and inside that flower is the little opening for the bird feeder. The first few nights I left it out there on its own because my dog usually scares them away with all the barking. In the morning when I could hear them, I would run to go check and see if any birds went to it. It took a couple of days but finally I saw a bird feeding from it. Before I could grab my camera, here comes the dog barking and scared the bird away. Even if you can’t get the bird to come directly to you, I do like watching from my window.

"I live across the street from a crossfit gym and noticed they use a lot of equipment that are easy to use at home. Like a jump rope.The Aoneky is not only a jump rope it acts as a counter. The rope and grip are made of NBR foam and the handle is made of plastic. At 9.18 ft in length it is very adjustable. At the bottom of the handle you just pull the excessive amount of rope and tighten to desired length. The handles are made with anti-slip foam making them easy to grip while being comfortable. At the end of each set it counts how many reps you have completely and easily resets by using the reset button.I find these much safer to use than the wired ones. They can be used on multi-surfaces from indoor to outdoor. These are safe for the entire family to use without cutting wires. I highly recommend.

It also does any engine that requires a battery.It also functions as a power source when you are away from home. It can be used on land or water. It can charge a 4 up to 8 cylinder. As a women the 2 things I’m scared of the most when traveling alone is my battery dying and no one there to help me or my phone being dead and I can’t call for help. It also has a strobe light at the top to signal for help.Overall I think this is a must even if you’re not a woman. It is great to have especially if you are isolated.

"Eyeshadow palettes are great for travel. You can get multiple looks without carrying a lot of individual pans.It comes in a black case, kind of thinner than I like. When I opened  it I noticed the plastic guard. It comes with 11 shimmer shadow and 4 matte shadows. A first I thought all the shadows were shimmer, but in my opinion it’s the fallout from the other shadows.I swatched them on a paper lined up as it would be in the pan to give you more of an idea of how it looks. I’ve used my hand and brush for some swatches. On the skin it is pigmented more than your average drugstore product. The colors on the picture and the actually colors I received are darker. The dark shades did not bother me because for a more natural look I want cool undertones which I was able to get.This palette is great for an everyday look nothing so over the top. You can easily transition from day to night and all the colors work well together or individually. I will say if you don’t have to use your fingers, don’t I notice more fall out that way and it tends to get chalky, but with a brush it works fine.Overall for this price point and the amount of shadows and quality I would definitely recommend. No drugstore palette has this amount payoff with both shimmer and matte. I received this product free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.

"I sit can sit at my desk for up to 10 hours a day.

The foam is supported by a black mesh keeps my back cool without feeling like I’m getting back sweat.It comes with a nylon strap with 2 that can extend up to 18inches to secure to the back of any chair. I like it because it keeps me from having to reposition each time I move or leave my seat.

"Lights always set the mood. These lights can be used indoor or outdoor. The string includes 180 mini LED lights that are flexible and can be molded to any shape that you want.

"Check all that apply:1. You love music.2. You want to be able to crank up the volume without disturbing your roommates/officemates.3. Money is no option.If all of these apply to you, look no further. The Fostex TH900 is superb in every regard: comfort, build quality, and of course sound.I work in an open office environment, with a lot of background chatter, so I've always sought headphones that could let me focus on my music while I work throughout the day. Comfort, isolation, and sound quality are my three priorities, in that order. Previously, I wore the Beyerdynamic T5p, which is also excellent, but which unfortunately broke after 3 years of regular use. The T5p has a loose, flimsy feel to it, so it wasn't entirely surprising, though it was disappointing to have to seek out a replacement. The TH900 came highly recommended by the audiophile community (moreso than the T5p), and I was delighted by what I found: A headphone with all the virtues of the T5p that feels built to last a lifetime.Comfort-wise, the TH900 is superb, with incredibly soft synthetic leather cups and a spring mechanism that distributes their weight evenly around your ears. Despite their bulk and pressure, they feel light and breathable. I find most headphones exhausting after an hour, tops. But I could wear the TH900 all day long.The wooden cups give the TH900 excellent isolation—about the best you'll get in a full-sized headphone (as opposed to an in-ear). I can turn up my music to near-piercing levels without bothering the colleague at the desk next to mine.And perhaps it goes without saying that the sound quality is amazing. The TH900 is never shrill, which makes it ideal for extended listening.For the opinion of an audiophile who is far less easily impressed than I am, I'd recommend reading David Mahler's review of the TH900 in his famous ""Battle of the Flagship Headphones"" article. As he sums it up: ""The TH900 is a very versatile headphone, capable of sounding good with every genre."" Coming from him—a connoisseur of luxury headphones—that's strong praise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KS4111Y7Z1WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007G8UMP2#wasThisHelpful","R1KS4111Y7Z1WP","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent dock, designed to be compatible with all Lightning-powered iPhones/iPads. It comes with its own cable. There are no problems with the Lightning technology here. However, there is a more mundane problem: In order to provide compatibility with open-bottom cases, there's an extra 1cm or so of space between the Lightning plug and the back of the dock. What this means is that if your device is uncased, you can't just press it against the back of the dock and slide it down. Instead, you have to carefully line up your device's Lightning port with the dock's plug. Since the whole point of a dock is to be more convenient than plugging in a Lightning cable, this little bit of extra effort is disappointing.Aesthetically, the dock is nothing to write home about. The grey-and-red color scheme feels washed-out. The plug wobbles slightly, making it difficult to tell whether the device is precisely centered.All of these are nitpicks, but docks are luxuries. Why bother to get one that doesn't feel first-rate?","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LC9URBOQXO7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E965FGK#wasThisHelpful","R3LC9URBOQXO7U","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: Cheap, fully functional (no warnings experienced when connecting it to recent-model Apple devices).Cons: Thick plastic around the Lightning plug means that it won't fit in some docks/cases, poor aesthetics compared to authentic Apple cable (looks worn-out right out of the box; why is the ""M"" on just one side of the Lightning plug when the connector is symmetrical?)The thick plug is a major ""gotcha.""

"The idea of an air purifier with built-in Febreze makes sense for bathrooms. Febreze is uniquely adept at covering up foul odors, while an air filter is the best way to pull potentially harmful bacteria out of the air.In practice, though, this unit isn't much use. For a small fraction of the price, you could get a Febreze plug-in. Meanwhile, the air filter—note that ""HEPA-type"" is a marketing term meaning that that the filter doesn't meet HEPA standards—is underpowered and over-obtrusive. Even on the lowest setting, the internal fan emits an unsubtle, high-pitched hum. And at that setting, it's barely moving any air. An adaptive fan (which would remain silent until, say, a toilet flushes in the vicinity) would be far more useful.In short, the Febreze Air Purifier is a clever concept, but the execution here is underwhelming.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79LU67FY4B73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP292QC#wasThisHelpful","R79LU67FY4B73","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fluance Fi30 advertises that it ""automatically pairs your Bluetooth device when in range."" That sounds like a cool feature, but it leads to a lot of annoyances:* Let's say you have two devices that you've paired with the speaker before, a phone and a tablet. You want to pair the phone, but the tablet is already paired. So you have to unpair the tablet before you can pair the phone. (Trying to pair the phone while the tablet is already paired will just give you a generic Bluetooth connection error.) The more devices you have, the more frustrating this becomes.* Most Bluetooth speakers have a button that you have to press to allow new devices to be paired. With the Fluance, anyone can pair a new device at any time (as long as no device is already paired). So if, say, you live in an apartment, any of your neighbors can—intentionally or accidentally—pair their device with the speaker and use it. There's no solution other than powering off the speaker. And, of course, when you power it on, it'll try to auto-pair with their device again.* The speaker makes a (LOUD) jet engine-like noise every time a device is paired or unpaired, exacerbating these pairing annoyances.In the end, I decided to return this speaker and instead get a Logitech Bluetooth Audio Adapter, which has much better pairing behavior: no auto-pairing, requires a button for pairing, and multiple devices can be paired simultaneously (though only one can stream audio). It's a tiny device and you can connect it to any speaker with an aux in port. All-in-one Bluetooth speakers are great in theory, but their designers tend not to put much thought into how Bluetooth pairing works in the real world.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OPGQL4ELN35U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3I5VL4#wasThisHelpful","R3OPGQL4ELN35U","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kelly Link is a writer's writer, someone who plays with words and narrative structures in ways that are likely to go over casual reader's heads. For some, this provides an intoxicating challenge.

For certain readers (Neil Gaiman among them), Kelly Link's unconventional writing is a breath of fresh air. But if your tastes tend more toward the mainstream, Get In Trouble is not the short story collection for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSLNT3VTA2OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179689#wasThisHelpful","R3GSLNT3VTA2OZ","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a truly excellent blender. First off, it has an elegant look and feel that's perfectly suited to a modern kitchen. It also has a relatively low height, so it fits easily on the counter under my cabinets. Second, it's one of the most powerful blenders on the market—Blendtec is well known for their ""Will It Blend?"" videos. And third, Blendtec is a solid company that stands by their products.After nearly 3 years of frequent use, my blender developed a motor problem. I called Blendtec's 800 number and was promptly connected with a support representative. After a brief and polite chat, they offered to send me a replacement. I received it a few days later, along with a pre-paid label with which to send back the old one. So when Blendtec advertises a 7-year warranty, they're not kidding.

The Met-Rx Prime bars contain only natural ingredients, and the result is a better experience.

"With previous iPhone generations, I've never felt the need for a protective case. The iPhone 6 is different. With its round sides, the phone always threatens to slip out of my grip. With its awkwardly protruding camera, it won't lie flat on a table, and I constantly worry about the lens getting scratched. And the big screen makes me more concerned than ever about a drop leading to cracking. So I'd been giving serious thought to buying a case when, luckily, I was offered the Silk Stealth Armor Tough Case to review.And it's a terrific case. It looks very sleek, exactly as pictured. It's sturdy, yet light and flexible enough to put on and remove without too much effort. It protects every part of the phone, yet keeps everything accessible. The designers have clearly paid a lot of attention to detail on that front; for instance, the hole around the headphone jack is wide enough that you shouldn't have a problem even with L-shaped plugs. Also, because the case is far enough from the edges of the screen that ""swipe from the edge"" gestures will work fine.I personally don't care for the adhesive screen cover that the case comes with, but I've never liked any kind of iPhone screen cover, and it's purely optional. If you're worried about scratch damage, use the screen cover. If you're comfortable having your phone's bare screen exposed, don't.

"In Search of Stupidity is a snarky business history revolving around the personal computer, from its invention in the late '70s to its ubiquity in the late '90s. While most stories focus on the winners, here we see the losers make catastrophic mistakes again and again. Of course, the ""stupidity"" involved is usually just rational decision-making under a set of assumptions that turned out to be false, such as IBM famously failing to realize that by allowing Microsoft to develop the OS for their PC, they were ceding control of the whole platform.Chapman, who worked at various software companies during those turbulent years, is happy to point fingers and laugh, but it's hard to infer any broader insights from these stories. After all, Chapman himself is hardly clairvoyant: He uses Apple's computers  and their devotees as a running joke throughout the book. Today, 1 in 4 computers sold is a Mac, not to mention Apple's dominance of the smartphone and tablet categories that they invented just a few years after In Search of Stupidity was published.Overall, I enjoyed In Search of Stupidity as a light-hearted look back at a fascinating time in the tech world.

"For the last 3 years, I've owned a RabbitAir MinusA2, and it's dramatically improved the air quality in my apartment, all but eliminating the old building's musty odor. I received the Coway air purifier to review, so I'll attempt to compare the two. I don't have any basis for measuring performance, so I'll focus on features and aesthetics.The Coway features 3 layers of filters: a washable pre-filter (for dust and hair), a carbon odor filter, and a HEPA filter for tiny particles. That's a good, minimal design for high-quality air filtration. The RabbitAir has all of those plus two more: a ""medium"" filter between the pre-filter and the HEPA, and a ""custom"" filter tailored toward whatever type of microparticle you're most worried about. I'd say that anything beyond HEPA + carbon filtration is overkill, but those with certain allergies may disagree. If that's you, take a close look at RabbitAir's custom filters.Both the Coway and the RabbitAir can automatically adjust their fan speed, from near-silent to about 50dB (roughly the volume level of a normal conversation), based on air quality measurements. This feature could be very annoying if it were implemented poorly, but both devices actually work quite well. Both stay quiet enough that I can keep one in my bedroom and never be woken up by fan noise. Both stay at near-silent level most of the time, only kicking into overdrive when I'm cooking (because of the smoke) or vacuuming (because of the dust). I'm impressed at the technology involved here. I should mention that the RabbitAir can also be adjusted with a remote control (the Coway doesn't have one), but I never use it.The only clear win for the RabbitAir is it looks. The Coway is a decent-looking appliance, but the RabbitAir is friendlier and less obtrusive. While the Coway is curvy in the front and boxy in the back (like an old CRT TV), the RabbitAir is flat and easy to keep flush against a wall or in a corner. I'll also say that the RabbitAir's filters are a bit easier to install: it took a little bit of difficulty to snap the Coway's into place.In summary, I don't like the Coway quite as much as I like the RabbitAir, but it has 90% of the RabbitAir's features at half the price. If money is no option, spring for the RabbitAir. But if you're looking for the sweet spot in price-to-performance, the Coway might just be it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5FZH7X5D2Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTKAPUU#wasThisHelpful","R1R5FZH7X5D2Z2","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item to review, and compared it with my existing Simplehuman Adjustable Shower Caddy.The Simplehuman is a more expensive product, and it looks that way, with a beautiful stainless steel gleam. The InterDesign opts for simplicity: 4 equal-sized baskets, all metal with a matte finish.There's no soap caddy, which seems like an oversight. But then, most showers have room for a soapdish. Or perhaps you use body wash.My only serious complaint is that the single suction cup is nowhere near sufficient to hold the shower caddy in place. The slightest nudge (say, from the shower hose) causes the caddy to wobble on the axis of freedom that the suction cup provides. An only slightly harder nudge causes the suction cup to come loose. As much as I like the simple symmetry as the single suction cup in theory, in practice, a shower caddy that mounts at the hose should have at least 2 suction cups. Or, you could opt for an even simpler and less obtrusive solution: A mesh shower caddy that hangs on the shower curtain. InterDesign makes one, and it costs half as much. I'd give that a try first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O21WBYECS2JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUYMLUW#wasThisHelpful","R2O21WBYECS2JE","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Countless players (myself included) have been made into competent tournament Texas Hold'em players by the classic Harrington on Hold'em books. A decade later, Harrington has updated those classic works for today's tournament scene and condensed the result into a single, all-new volume.Actually, Harrington on Modern Tournament Poker is more of a sequel than a revision: It's organized differently (more on that later), and it's dropped some of the early sections that made it approachable to true beginners. This is an intermediate book, one you'll get the most out of after playing a tournament or two and wondering, ""What went wrong?""The original Harrington books were a gentle introduction in part because common techniques like bluffing and slow-playing were relegated to the second volume, so that the first could focus purely on making reasonable value bets. The new Harrington is broken down instead into the different phases of a hand: pre-flop, the flop, the turn, and the river. At first, this structure is a bit jarring, but it has the advantage that it allows you to look up any scenario you've experienced and find Harrington's answer. ""Should I have called my opponent's bet on the turn?"" ""Should I have led out on the river?""A concluding section contrasts Harrington's prescribed style of play (tight but imaginative) with the now-ubiquitous LAG style, and offers some basic recommendations for playing against the LAG players you've identified at your table. Page-for-page, this may be the most valuable section of the book. Unfortunately, it's very short and doesn't cover ever situation.Still, this is a truly great poker book that should satisfy the many players who've been waiting to sink their teeth into a more advanced volume that maintains the virtues of the Harrington on Hold'em series: readable prose, well-explained reasoning, and a plethora of useful example hands. No one else writes about poker the way Harrington does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9ANQRPUX64V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1880685566#wasThisHelpful","RZ9ANQRPUX64V","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With the XBAH3, Sony is now offering a similar 3-way design with similar audio quality, with a lighter yet smartly-balanced design, at half the price. To sweeten the deal, they've included a detachable cable with built-in controls for your iPhone.I'm very impressed by these. If you're looking for some great IEMs under $400, look no further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH8GRP8KZFDXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJISZ28#wasThisHelpful","RH8GRP8KZFDXM","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a SimpleHuman Adjustable Shower Caddy, a product that costs nearly twice as much as the InterDesign Hanging Caddy. The SimpleHuman is more obtrusive (getting in the way of the showerhead) and requires more maintenance (its suction cups come loose, its stainless steel rusts). SimpleHuman is a great brand, but the hanging caddy is, quite simply, the better design for holding shampoos and other shower knickknacks. It lies flat against the shower curtain and doesn't interfere with my ability to open or close it. The pockets make it easy to ""feel for"" whatever item you need. Need more storage?

"Full disclosure: I took Rob Dobrow's probability class as an undergrad nearly a decade ago, and worked as a research assistant for him one summer.This is an excellent textbook for anyone looking for a mathematically rigorous introduction to probability who also wants to jump right in to writing simulations. This fills a critical gap: Books that introduce probability and statistics tend to assume that students will figure out how to put that mathematical knowledge into working code later (easier said than done), and books that introduce R tend to require that you already have a good grounding in probability theory. All this book requires is some familiarity with formal mathematical notation, and by the end of it, you'll be able to create useful simulations for any quantitative field. I would recommend this book to any student in a field where the ability to formulate and test precise theories is valued, from economics to biology.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N6AZNO509KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118241258#wasThisHelpful","R2N6AZNO509KH","A70NFM6KHU24F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A70NFM6KHU24F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Aurvana is trying to compete with cool, travel-friendly headphones like the Sennheiser Momentum and Bowers & Wilkins P3 at half the price. That's a lofty goal, and Creative achieves part of it: These headphones feel comfortable, fold nicely into the included travel pouch, and look very cool. Unfortunately, they don't come close to those rivals in sheer audio quality. Vocals are muffled, bass is weak, and detail is poor. This might be in part because Creative made the bizarre decision to have an old-fashioned in-line volume slider, which works by weakening the incoming signal rather than communicating with the connected device.There are better options out there. If you're willing to stretch your budget to the $200 range, the options I mentioned above are excellent, as is the Onkyo-ES-CTI300 (which I recently reviewed).

"I suppose it helps to be a magic nerd to really enjoy this show, but I have a hard time believing many people would not be wowed by what these young, up-and-coming illusionists are able to accomplish. And one of the most amazing things is that they have to work with first three and then four ""common objets"" (a can of Spam, say, or a pirate's costume), and create the rest of the illusions around these objects using items found in a sort of magic attic that includes a workshop.I have a pretty good idea how several of the tricks worked, but there have been a few that have left me utterly baffled. Veteran magicians Penn & Teller, too.And by the way, among the show's other pleasures, Penn Jillette provides wise, witty commentary on the performances. You can love him or hate him for his brash, bigger-than-life persona, but when it comes to magic, the man is a knowledgeable and serious expert. I am a deep admirer of success that results from a passion toward excellence, and Penn & Teller embody that virtue, I think, and impart that value in ""their"" (in quote because Teller doesn't actually speak publically) critique.I don't know if ""Wizard Wars"" has enough going for it to last more than a season. I haven't run into very many people yet who are even aware of the series. But I think it's a worthy experiment that deserves an audience. If you enjoy magic--the nuts and bolts of illusions, and the ability to puzzle out how a trick might have been accomplished--then you'll almost certainly enjoy ""Wars.""

"It's easy to dismiss genre TV shows as mindless entertainment, but some of the greatest explorations of ideas and of what it means to be human have come through sci-fi and fantasy shows such as Star Trek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dexter, The X Files, and others in a similar vein. Perhaps no series has raised more interesting questions than ""Supernatural,"" and this thin volume does a good job of introducing the issues raised (and gesturing toward some philosophical responses).Chief among the issues ""Supernatural"" raises is the moral issue of when it's right to kill. Not all monsters are immoral and some humans are monstrous--so how do Sam and Dean decide? The moral landscape of ""Supernatural"" is fraught, and a few of the book's earlier essays help provide guidance for we, as fans, can decide for ourselves which actions might be justified, and when gray becomes black.Other issues addressed include the fascinating ""theology"" of ""Supernatural,"" with a special emphasis on hell. In God's absence, it seems hell is a democracy. What to make of that? Also, what about the Cartesian dualism present in some episodes--what does it mean for us to be not one substance (a physical brain, the activity of which constitutes ""mind"") versus a mind or spirit that's dwelling within a body. Only dualism can explain the rampant possessions that occur on the show, but that raises some prickly philosophical issues.In fact, that's what ""Supernatural and Philosophy""--much like the other books in this philosophy of pop culture series--is mainly good for. The essays are too slight and the treatment too facile to provide anything like a rounded philosophy, and it's in the nature of a lot of good storytelling not to be strictly consistent philosophically, anyway, so one can find, for example, nods to both capitalism and Marxism, animal rights and carnivory, and so forth. ""Supernatural"" is not guilty of foolish consistency, and has always shown a whimsical willingness to go anywhere a good story can be found.The least successful essays in this book--and here I present a personal bias--are the ones that are issue or identity oriented. There is certainly nothing WRONG in examining the role of women in the ""Supernatural"" universe, but I tend to think of such issues as separate from the more philosophy-philosophy questions raised. In fairness, it certainly is practical application of philosophy, but I suppose I like my musings more abstract and less pedantic, and identity issues feel to me like a distraction.Having said that, this is a quick, invigorating read with few false steps, and will appeal to fans of the who wish to dig deeper into the ideas that propel the story, and to fans of philosophy looking for narrative hooks that can be used to think about issues more concretely. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ETK4ZKPDV6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118615956#wasThisHelpful","R17ETK4ZKPDV6U","A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How much did I want to love this book? It's on a topic that I find utterly fascinating, using a medium I adore. And to be fair, James Lu Dunbar handles the subject matter with some aplomb--he shows great promise and even this work is not a total flop. Incidental and background artwork, for example, is amazingly lovely and detailed and includes such design elements as the Mandelbrot fractal. But the main characters are very unappealing, and much of the ""poetry"" is sing-songy doggerel that does not much succeed in conveying important facts. I’m all for making science fun and accessible, but accuracy and meaning should not be sacrificed on an altar of “cute.” This was by no means the worst example of that sort of thing I’ve seen, but for a much better graphic treatment of evolution, take a look at “Clan Apis” or “Sandwalk.” Those books do a much better job of balancing entertainment and solid science.Again—it pains me to write anything critical about this book for which I held out the highest of hopes, but my hope now is that James makes good on the incredible promise he shows and continues to produce better and better works, perhaps with a willingness to compromise some art for the sake of matter.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B00VMX1EPBWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1460916107#wasThisHelpful","R3B00VMX1EPBWY","A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People who criticize the quality of the audio aren't wrong, and some parts of some lectures--accompanies as we know they are from the oral description by slides and chalk drawings and equations--are a bit of a loss in audio. BUT. Feynman's reputation for lively, entertaining, accessible lectures on sometimes challenging physics topics is on full display in these recordings, and they are a sheer delight to listen to. My partner and I listened to them while on a very long drive to visit relatives, and they made us feel that rather than being in a Kia Rio chugging down a highway in Iowa, we were actually in an early 1960s classroom, where Russian cosmonauts had recently done the unthinkable and orbited our planet, and this everyday, plain-spoken genius was reeling out science as if it were beat poetry.

"This is a lovely, classy set, its only drawback being an essential component of its greatest strength: the chains and clasps are as delicate as air. What this means visually is that the pearls seem to dance suspended by nothing around the neck and wrist, which is really eye-catching and pleasing, but on a practical note it makes it pretty hard to manipulate the clasps to get them on without a struggle. If you have nimble fingers and good eyesight, this will not be a concern, but if you are older or impaired, consider that there might be some frustration attached to wearing these.But fashion always comes at a price, I guess, and to reiterate--once on, these are some supremely stylish and classic pearls that will accent a range of clothes, from sweaters to little black dresses. I'm a dude, OK, and not much into jewelry, but I've seen these pearls on two women now (relax, one was my mom), and they looked really nice on both ladies. Other dudes--if you're looking for something versatile and not so unique as to maybe be inappropriate, you could do a LOT worse than going with this sort of high-utility classic style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188XT5EQNHAM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GII0KH6#wasThisHelpful","R188XT5EQNHAM6","A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years back when I first got Norton Internet Security for a then-new laptop, I became annoyed at what I took to be the extra time that the security was adding to my work. It seemed to be fussily buzzing around in the background and doing little more than adding friction to my efforts, slowing me down. So I disabled the protection. And then things really ground to a halt.It's impossible to overestimate the number of beasties and bogies creeping around all over the internet, waiting to infect your computer with crippling and lethal contagions. After trying a few different brands, I've concluded that Norton represents the most comprehensive and least obviously intrusive remedy. The protection I receive from Norton's software approaches 100 percent effectiveness, and their service has been prompt and responsive when called upon. There are features I, as a more casual Internet user, never or seldom need to use, but one thing everyone needs is a way of determining in advance whether it's safe to go to a certain site or download anything from it. Norton, leveraging superior technology and an army of users, goes a great distance toward making me feel safe. If they say somethings OK to do, I'll assume it is indeed safe. So far they've never steered me wrong.Another benefit, especially for non-techies like me: installation is relatively intuitive and painless. Once installed, I all but forget about the program except on those occasions when it asks me to review a report or run a scan and corrective measures. Yes, that takes several minutes each month. Compared to a permanently slowed browsing and processing speed, that's an amazing bargain.

"Within one sturdy plastic container the size of a toaster oven students will find the electronic componenets, the structural components, the software, and the instructions to explore a world of robotics, physics, electronics, design and engineering. The projects that can be undertaken using this kit are limited only by imagination--the components are almost endlessly modular and can be purposed for a wide variety of end uses. The greatest feature is the opportunity to learn programming skills. With relatively simple on-screen programming tools, students can learn about how interfaces between computers and the projects work, including for models of cars and a swing bridge. I did not try the other models so cannot comment on them, but they include an amusement park ride and a toll booth. Software is compatible with PC, OS is Vista or XP.

"I watched V/H/S dutifully, as a genre fan. Interesting concept. Heavy on the fetishes, light on interesting ideas. So I wasn't prepared for the occasional full-on BRILLIANCE of VHS2. The thing to remember is, you have to take these vignettes for what they are supposed to be--collected found footage of horrifying scenarios. If you view this anthology as a traditional horror movie, you will of course be disappointed. This is more like being in a fist-person videogame with no control over the action. It is unsettling, unnerving, and often enough, downright terrifying. Yes, it's gory. Possibly excessively gory--although I was in awe of how they got some of those shots, like the exploding guy. The wraparound story was relatively weak, but it ended fairly strong. For genre fans, 2 is much more of a must-see than the original was. And I hope they make enough money from this one to make another, even stronger entry.By the way, if you already saw and enjoyed this movie, you might like The Bay [HD].

"I received these stereo Hi-Fi headphones to review under the Vine program, so they were not necessarily something that I had an initial felt need for and went shopping to find. They were spoon fed to my because of my interests. Having said that, I'm happy to have them, but as they are no more mobile than ear buds--which, if good enough, provide comparable sound quality--and don't seem to represent a huge advantage over my Bluetooth enabled Eton Rugged Rukus All-Terrain Portable Solar Wireless Sound System (Green) for casual listening (except that of course it does allow PRIVATE listening that would not disturb a mate or partner). I also found this headphone initially difficult to pair with my music device, although once the trick is understood, it's no more challenging than any other Bluetooth pairing.The price is good, for their size the headphones are quite comfortable (although you must keep your head fairly vertical to prevent them sliding off your head), the sound quality is outstanding, and the battery life is so far superb.

"We were extremely fortunate to see a local professional presentation of this play (put on in the chemistry auditorium of Catholic university, which was just about perfect stagecraft) a few months ago. It is very funny, very powerful, and ultimately had me melting into a pool of sob-wrung tears. Few plays have affected me more radically than ""Emilie"" (but another that did is ""Photograph 51,"" about Rosiland Franklin who helped discover the structure of DNA, also a female intellectual, so maybe I have a thing about that?).What is surprising is that for my partner and I simply to exchange reading lines back and forth in this book, paying little heed to character consistency or even gender, was almost as powerful as seeing the play had been. Actually, I'm sure having seen the play within memory helped aid the potency of the experience, but even if I had never seen it, I think just the printed version would have moved me by itself.I say that by way of stating: See they play, by all means. If it is as well-performed as the version we saw, you will be delighted and possibly shaken.

"This staging of Jesus Christ Superstar is so fresh and powerful, it hardly seems like the same musical as Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), the venerable and well-intentioned hippy version. Live Arena JCS is for our times, set in our time, with real-world concerns and references (texting, reality TV, One Direction, corruption among the power elite, surveillance, etc.). But it's the music that really ups this JCS's game, from a harder-edged, less strings-driven instrumentation to vocals that run a gamut from wispy and crooning to primal scream and rabid growl.I ordered this DVD right away because I'm a big Tim Minchin fan, having seen him in concert in Minneapolis a couple of years ago and at his performance at last year's Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., and Minchin has the key role of Judas. Minchin does a terrific job with that role and gives dramatic voice to the character's ambivalence about who Jesus is and how to respond to the unfolding story.Two slightly false notes in an otherwise sterling experience: I didn't care for the staging of King Herod's song (but to be honest, the campy, comedic song has always seemed a little intrusive given the dire events that surround it--still I've seen it done better in other stagings); and the ""Superstar"" production near the end, with Judas posing that all-important question, ""Are you who they say you are?"" to the crucified Jesus, was so glitzy and glittery with twerking angels (well--almost twerking) that the seriousness of the song's intent is easily lost.But maybe that's OK. The effect of JCS is to humanize Jesus, and to reclaim what amounts to a kind of folk hero from theologians who seem more intent on creating finely crafted, almost algebraic, dogmas and doctrines ABOUT Jesus, than to let his story wash over them with all its power and drama. I am proudly and happily an atheist. But I have never been immune to the appeal of a person who tries to stand against the oppressors of his or her time, to identify with vulnerable people, to love and lose and feel betrayal and denial, and to courageously face an uncertain destiny with defiance and courage. Stripped of some frankly irrational and unappealing theological elements, the Jesus story presented in Jesus Christ Superstar--and especially, THIS Jesus Christ Superstar--is one for the ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC103ZEVSMV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM3TKNU#wasThisHelpful","RC103ZEVSMV1","A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pretty hard on Prof. Cox's turn with Wonders of the Universe series. I just thought he was being too much of a hippie. And now I have to revisit my opinion, because it could just be that I am the problem--if I knew as much about astronomy and physics as I do biology, would I understand better the breathless, cow-eyed wonder that Cox brings to the topic, as he does with Life?Because I have to say, every sigh, every pause and glance and meaning-pregnant moment of the ""Life"" series seems utterly justified by the subject matter, even as it is astonishingly, beautifully illustrated with BBC's best nature photography (which is saying something). I even appreciated the physicist's perspective that Cox brought to the topic, as when he explained that the electronic gradiant sensing organisms use is analogous to the phenomenon of lightning.This is an arresting, brilliant series that can be faulted only for being too short--I hope there are sequals.

"With 80x magnification, this is a powerful spotting scope that can be used over a wide range of distances.  It's also robust enough to sling into a backpack without having to worry much about knocking delicate optics off-kilter.  I found it to be a useful tool for wildlife spotting and bird-watching, and I appreciate the tough, portable design--clearly engineered with hunters in mind.HOWEVER. I don't find it as easy to use as my comparably high-mag binoculars, especially for initially spotting the subject. If you are looking at something a great distance away at high magnification, the difference of a fraction of an inch aiming on your end means many feet different at the end where your subject is located, and that can mean a lot of flailing around, trying to get the subject centered in the scope. The scope DOES come with a handy tripod mount (and clever way to connect to a digital SLR camera--which I do not own), and using a tripod would no doubt have helped.  But lugging a tripod around means, basically, good-bye to the compact convenience of the scope otherwise.  By balancing and bracing the scope against solid objects--like a stump--you can replicate fairly effectively the stability afforded by a tripod.Overall, I can't say that I am displeased with the product, and in situations where packing space is at its most premium (think fly-ins, for example) I'll prefer the scope to my binoculars.  Otherwise, for everyday use, I think I still prefer to better ability to find my subject using the double tubes.Afterthought: I see that the five-star reviews are getting a large number of ""not helpful"" votes, but few comments.  I am curious, if anyone reads this who has had a much different experience of the scope, or who is looking for different kinds of product information, how are those reviews coming up short in your mind? I see one seemed to be nothing more than plagiarism from the company's own product description, and I get how that's not helpful, but I wonder about the other votes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTL73L6Q002K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJFAYKQ#wasThisHelpful","RPTL73L6Q002K","A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It appears to work from no script whatever--a hypothesis practically confirmed in the ""making of"" feature--and characterization is limited to ""be as annoying as humanly possible.""  Michael Cera's character was the worst of the lot, a mincing, lispy queen-to-be in the midst of gay panic.  I had no sympathy for any of the characters, thoroughly disliked the lot of them, and could not be bothered to care about what happened to them.  The movie buzzed and droned for what felt like hours (and that was with some fast-forwarding), and then fizzled through a protracted ending that explained nothing, resolved nothing, and made little sense.All of which makes it seem like if a movie is not perfectly plotted and wrapped up at the end neat as a bow, I won't like it.  Not true.  I love, for example, the ending of Limbo.  Sucker Punch was a bit of a mess, and I loved that, too.  Hell, I even liked Human Centipede, just for the pure novelty of it.

"I am loving this new kitchen item for my favorite room in the house! I am a bit of a hoarder when it comes to kitchen items and I truly have been wanting a Mortar and Pestle for the longest time! This is perfect for grinding spices, herbs, grains, garlic and ginger! I have even used this to crush a little fresh mint for my Mojitos as well and man can these be expensive as they are heavy and solid and will last a lifetime and beyond! This is fabulous and I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to purchase a Mortar and Pestle... they come in 2 sizes via Amazon. There is a 3.75 inch size and a 4.5 inch size. I grabbed the 4.5 inch size because I can always use the bigger of the two especially when they are priced the same! This is made of a gorgeous grey and white marble and I simply wash by had after using it. It is easy to clean and like I mentioned before.... it will last forever!

"I am loving this BeFit24 Abdominal Support Binder while I am working at my computer everyday. It really helps just to keep everything tight and together and is assisting in helping to strengthen my belly area.

This really has helped to strengthen it all PLUS it is perfect to use while I am doing my low impact workouts. It helps to keep me supported while I am working out those abdominal muscles... without any worry of straining my muscles and overdoing it. I love it and I would recommend this for anyone that needs a little extra support as I do. I really do feel better after having used it and will be ordering another one.This is perfect for anyone that needs the extra support or who has had a harsh surgery or C-Section recently.

"My daughter is loving the DKnight Magicbox Bluetooth Speaker for sure! She has officially claimed it as hers and I agree that it is perfect for her. She uses this all of the times with her gadgets while in her bedroom. Her bedroom is a small size so it sounds great in there. She also uses this when she is showering in the Bathroom. She does not use this in the shower as it is not waterproof....but actually playing on the counter top while she is in there. She loves to use it in the bathroom while she is getting ready for school in the morning and it is perfect and sounds great for sure. Personally for me this is a compact and adorable little powerful speaker that works great in smaller sized rooms, etc.... It is totally fine outside when it is on the quiet side but if you have a large gathering of friends and/or family over .... you may not hear it too well. This, as I mentioned before is a nice compact size... so it travels well in my daughters larger sized messenger bag or her backpack. She loves it and agrees it should receive 5 stars because for a little speaker it packs a punch and sounds really nice.

"I was super excited to try out Everlast's VP Pro Vegan Protein Mix in Vanilla. I actually read reviews of the product while I was waiting to receive it for my own review and the reviews were amazing and honest. The one thing I was worried about was would I like the taste? I have tried protein mixes and shakes before from other brands and some were OK... while others were just horrible. So you can imagine my hesitance which was so not needed. This Vegan Protein mix from Everlast is actually quite delicious. I even liked it in my hand held shaker bottle mixed with water. That says a lot to me and was the reason I was excited to try out some protein shakes with this in the form of smoothies. I am starting to work out again and I figured smoothies mixed with this Vegan Protein mix from Everlast would be a great breakfast substitute for me. I will be making smoothies every morning with this mix and then will do my workout routine around 11AM or so every morning. This smoothie will be the perfect breakfast and will prepare my body for my light workouts while assisting in my post workout recovery. I will share my results as I go too. :)There are a lot of things I like about Everlast's VP Pro Vegan Protein Shake Mix. I like that one serving provides you with 22 grams of muscle building protein. I love that it is GMO free, Hormone free, Gluten free, Lactose-Free and Soy free. I like that it increases lean muscle mass and strength and also increases post workout recovery. Everlast VP is blended to promote lean muscle growth and recovery using the highest grade yellow pea, rice and hemp proteins available. I especially like that this mixes with your smoothies extremely well and gives you a delicious smoothie that tastes great and is good for you! There are tons of smoothie recipes and ideas at Everlast's website too!I received this item in exchange for and unbiased and honest review and all opinions are 100% my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMEUAS3IN025/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ1C7VQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RMEUAS3IN025","A2JKMFS1K0V8YG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JKMFS1K0V8YG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this handheld juicer. This is by far one of the best that I have used due to it's versatility, capacity and effectiveness. This juices your citrus fruits better than others in that the way it juices, it truly gets the most juice out of your lemons, limes and even oranges! This works with small and large limes, small and large lemons and small and medium sized oranges. It is actually pretty easy to use and the unit and the way it is made... makes it easy to get all of that juice out and with little effort, all while being easy on the hands. It rinses clean by hand in 30 seconds and can go right into the dishwasher if you prefer. You can use this to make fresh mixed drinks, or to add a little citrus to a fresh salad or to add fresh lemon squeezed right over the top of your seafood. It is super versatile and a great alternative to big clunky juicers that either stay in your closet or cabinet or take up too much counter space. This is perfect for everyday use for adding those finishing touches to your amazing culinary creations!

"This is my favorite in car garbage bin of all time! Usually the bins are collapsing on me constantly and the garbage never seems to make it in. Or it falls over and the garbage is all over the floor. Not with this fabulous little garbage can! It is made with sturdy fabrics that will stay in place and it has elastic straps so that you can keep it safely in place in your backseat. I simply use a grocery store bag to line it... so that it helps to keep it clean longer and when it is full I just pull the bag out and toss it! Did I mention that this also converts to a cooler? On a small road trip you can fill this with ice and put a few cans of soda or bottles of water into it so that they stay nice and cold and are easily accessible! That is pretty cool! It is leak proof if used that way... so that is another added bonus. I would recommend this to anyone who owns a car and I would recommend getting one for each of your vehicles!

"This is an awesome beauty bundle for all! I love this set! You get a bottle of FULL STRENGTH Phytoceramides Advanced & the Perfect Compliment of Vitamin C Serum Advanced! All at a great price. With this duo you are getting the 1 * 2 Punch that we all need to stay young and vibrant. I have always been a fan of Vitamin C serums since I was in my late twenty's..... and I just love the citrus scent and the way that a ""good"" Vitamin C Serum just absorbs into the skin. I like it better than any moisturizer and this Vitamin C serum is the best.... it contains 20% Vitamin C and Hyaluric Acid. Those are the two most important must haves... then add in the Phytoceramides and you are covered! Once you use the Phytoceramides from day one believe it or not.... you will immediately experience tighter and smoother skin and you will also notice your skin is tingling and a little bit more rosy as it is reinvigorated. These are all great signs! I have noticed the dark circles and dark spots on my skin have lightened only after a week and I cannot wait to see the results after a full month!

I also really liked that the lid does not fall into the can when you are done opening it as it has the smooth edge and sits perfectly on top. You can also put the lid back on in the even you do not use all of the soup or veggies.... whatever it is that you are opening. This is a fabulous can opener for anyone with children in that you do not have the jagged dangerous edges that are the result of the traditional can opener.

"We love these binoculars! I have been on the hunt for a great pair and these meet all of my requirements! They are fabulous and my husband wants to add them to his ""survival pack"".... yes I know he has watched too many episodes of ""Dooms Day Preppers"" LOL!  Seriously though these are the best set of binoculars that I have ever owned and let me tell you why!  Waterproof, dust-proof, all-weather binoculars suitable for outdoor use.  Nitrogen gas inside the binocular eliminates fogging and mold on internal lens surfaces even under extremely severe condition, such as rainstorms and high humidity.  Internal Rangefinder Scale and Directional Compass with illumination switch indicates the distance or size of the object being viewed and its orientation.  Hi-Index Bak-4 prism features a bright, sharp image with vivid contrast to offer you every little detail of an object.  Rubber-coated body provides great shock resistance and a comfortable touch firm grasp.  So as you cane see these have the features that you need when relying on a pair of Binoculars. They cover it all.... I especially love the Nitrogen gas that is inside the binoculars to eliminate fogging and mold on the internal lens. These are not your normal Binoculars as they provide so many life saving options.... the Rangefinder Scale & Directional Compass are one of a few features! These are amazing and we have not even installed the batteries and are impressed.... with that extra boost they are going to be top notch! Check them out for yourself and if you are in  need of a pair of Binoculars.... these are the ones that everyone needs!I received this item in exchange for an honest review and all opinions are 100% my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GP7Z9KAJFEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DU3XDM#wasThisHelpful","R16GP7Z9KAJFEB","A2JKMFS1K0V8YG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JKMFS1K0V8YG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these battery operated tealights from Mars Tealights! They are fabulous and I have reviewed other tealights (that were battery operated) in the past and these are by far the best made. I left a tealight in my lantern for 5 days and the tealight just kept going! It was amazing.... I must admit that the light was not as bright at the end BUT i never expected it to run for a consecutive 120 hours PLUS! That was amazing! That truly tells you that you will get a TON of life out of each and everyone of these tealights! You will receive 24 of the tealights PLUS a little packet of rose petals to use if you choose... which I thought was a nice touch. :) Think about it.... you only use these tea lights for a couple of hours at a time normally.... and with each one lasting 120 hours+.... you will have a never ending supply of fabulous battery operated ""flickering"" tea lights. You cannot see the flickering in my photos.... but it flickers beautifully and as naturally as a true tea light candle.... all without the worry of an open flame. You still get the ambience without any of the danger! I love it and I have a couple throughout the house in my many candle holders and even in my daughters room because they are super safe! I would NEVER let her have a real candle in her room... but this is fine for me and it looks great on her dresser and shelves.

"This is a fabulous cutting board for the price! First off I love bamboo anything because it is so ""green"" and so durable. This cutting board did not disappoint. I ended up gifting this to my grandmother because they were using a cheap plastic cutting board that just never seems to clean well and is not durable at all. This I knew would be perfect because it is the perfect size for her.... not too big and not too small. Also it has that super cool handle on the side that you can use to carry it or even hang on the wall in the kitchen like my Grandmother did. That way it stores out of your way and easily accessible. This is a great cutting board for anyone and for any kitchen. Great product and I would recommend to anyone. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TRJF1J8UO0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIX8KZW#wasThisHelpful","R15TRJF1J8UO0A","A2JKMFS1K0V8YG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JKMFS1K0V8YG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband and my daughter LOVE this Smart Machine from Brain Crunch Toys. I have to admit that it is seriously cool and a fabulous gift for anyone (or any child :)) who loves building and creating. This is so much cooler than the building sets that I grew up with because you can actually bring your creation to life when you have completed it. I mean How cool is that you can make a remote controlled toy with building blocks and pieces and play and interact with it and change it up?!?! It is super cool and I am so glad I was introduced to this fabulous toy… especially with the holidays coming. I can see so many kids loving this for a gift at Christmas. It really is super cool.The super cool thing with this set is that you can create 4 different machines. It comes with directions for the 4 different machines and they vary in difficulty so one you need to step it up to a harder creation to challenge yourself… you can. Once you have created all four options you will be well-trained to create your own remote-controlled machine creation with the reuseable modules! It is never ending fun while learning!

This is a heavy duty piece made of thick and durable glass that is chip resistant and is beautiful on my kitchen island filled with nuts and candies. This is great to use everyday for your household and even a fabulous piece to use when having guests over. You could put olives and cheese cubes in these and have a tray of crackers on the side.... you can put fruit in each of them too.... for an outdoor barbecue in the spring and summer! The colors are perfect for fall and Thanksgiving and even Christmas. I will have it out always... it is just so very pretty!

"I love this portable Camping Stove! It is great. I love that it comes with a nice mesh carry bag to keep it organized while carrying it around in your bag and this comes with easy to follow instructions as well. This is perfect for cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner while hiking and camping. The piece is well made and the metal is sturdy. I was worried about it being flimsy, but no... this is a sturdy piece that will last for years to come. I also like that you can use this two ways... you can use fuel to keep the fire going OR you can use twigs or small leaves to get the fire going. Both ways work well and I like that you can use resources other than fuel to work this portable stove... because you will not have to leave your site to get more fuel. You can use the natural resources around you! I will be buying the metal shield next just to have in the event it is extremely windy out or just to protect the cooking area itself.

You know that a company is good when you receive a products and they correct any issues right away! They stand behind it because they believe in it. Simply put!Now let's talk about how extremely comfortable they are and how amazing they sound! When I have these on, nothing else exists in the world besides me and the music.

"This is an awesome pizza cutter. I actually have never owned a pizza cutter so I was thrilled to review this one. From what I can see when comparison shopping at my local store…. this pizza cutter is hands down a much better model than those available. This has a nice big handle that grips nicely to your hand and makes it easy to cut through whatever you are using it for. I have actually used this to cut pizza’s, stromboli’s, and some flatbreads. It works fabulously and really makes the cutting process a much easier task. It just glides right through.The benefits of this pizza cutter over others is amazing! This pizza cutter has a super comfy grip that feels like a natural. extension of your hand. It works well for both the young and old. My mom suffers from arthritis and this works easily for her. This is also made with a stainless steel pizza blade with a finger guard for added safety. That is why this is OK to allow the little ones to get busy in the kitchen and help out. :) It cuts through the pizza the first time and is also great for cutting dough, cookies and pastries! You can pop this little guy right into the dishwasher as well which is a must in my book! The company guarantees that you will love it with a 100% money back guarantee! That means a lot to me…. they are standing behind their product!All I can say is that if you have been on the search for a pizza cutter… this is the one to own!I received this product in exchange for an honest review and all opinions are 100% my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B7U6XKM977ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFJNEDK#wasThisHelpful","R3B7U6XKM977ZJ","A2JKMFS1K0V8YG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JKMFS1K0V8YG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My daughter came home from college and has claimed this for herself.... it really is perfect for her. It spins a smaller sized salad to make sure it is nice and dry so that your salad will grab those salad toppings and dressings much easier and the salad stays fresher longer. It is also a fabulous chopper. I just drop 2 onion halves in there and give it a spin and depending on how long you spin and chop.... you can obtain a fine chop or a thicker chop. Great for peppers, garlic, anything! This also has a mixing blade with an egg separator on the lid (my favorite feature!)... so you can whip up some homemade dressings and sauces as well! Very versatile and easy to clean compared to the big bulky electric units. I just pop this into the dishwasher and it is good to go.

"This is a super cool outdoor security light that can also be used for parties and events! It is really cool in that you can choose the regular white security light but also other colors for the different holidays and seasons. This also has the lights to run on a strobe, flash, fade or you can set it to slowly change to the next colors available. This actually has 16 different color tones.... so lots of options. I honestly feel this is high quality at an affordable price and we needed a new outdoor security lamp as our old one kicked the bucket. This works so much better.This light works off of a 12 volt system and is pretty easy to install. My brother is an electrician so he installed it in a flash but said that we could have done it on our own.

Their fierce attraction inevitably leads to off-the-charts sex skating the edge of danger of discovery as they set out not to define what is sacred, but to embrace it on a deeper level.FATHER TYLER ANSELM BELL: 29 years/Masters in Divinity/Catholic priest/Dark hair/Green eyes.Father Tyler Anselm Bell masters the balance between commanding, kinky, dirty-talking and inexhaustible lover and tender, sweet, caring, sincere and respectful friend and confidant.POPPY DANFORTH:  27 years/Heiress/MBA/Executive/Former stripper/Brown-black hair/Hazel eyes.Poppy Danforth was a bit of an enigma throughout with story partly due to story being Tyler’s POV  Seven words to describe Poppy: Captivating, charismatic, sexy, irresistible, evasive, lost and seeking.Priest, told solely from Tyler’s POV is a glimpse into a heart-tugging struggle for truth and purpose; right and wrong; to have or not to have.  Tyler is forced into questioning his choices, his existence and his future.  It is not a stand against religion on the contrary.  But above all this is a love story.The ending told from Poppy’s POV, offers clarity and closure.  Though writing flowed I might have wished for fewer parentheses.

"“It felt like his d*** brushed against the base of her brain. Interfering with basic thought process.”Before I get started on my review.  This, as clarified in blurb, is a story about an affair.  Do read this book if you are interested in Mischa’s journey, but if the aspect of an affair troubles you this might not be for you.My Time in the Affair (stand-alone) is insurance agent Mischa Rapaport, Misch’s story spanning a year starting with her having come to the decision to have an one-night-stand, the events surrounding it and the aftermath of her choice.Having married her boyfriend at age nineteen, in the near decade that followed they settled into a comfortable friendship, but the romance stagnated with months of no sex and a husband opposed to counseling.  So Mischa decided she would have an one-night stand.The perfect opportunity has arisen with her insurance agency opening up an office in Rome and her being selected as part of the team.  But once in Rome it proves difficult to engage in seductive flirting until one night she encounters the mysterious ex-military, Tal Canaan.She wanted a one-night stand but got so much more, good and bad.After a night of mind-blowing sex, a weak-kneed Mischa attempts to return to her life.  But fate wouldn’t have it. Instead she embarks on whirlwind affair with dire consequences as nearly everything in life comes at a price…“She’d never had sex like that, never been f*** ed like that before.  It was scary and amazing and so much more than anything she’d ever expected.?”TAL CANAAN:  29 years/Israeli-Italian/Ex-military/Surveillance/Black hair/Brown eyes/Multi-lingual/6'3"".Tal Canaan is palpable (like you could meet a man like him) yet a larger-than-life personality.  Nine words to describe Tal: Secretive, charming, sexual, commanding, challenging, persuasive, adventurous, enigmatic and fearless.MISCHA RAPAPORT, Misch:  27 years/American-Chinese/Insurance agent/Brown hair/Hazel eyes/Married/5’7”.Mischa Rapaport, Misch started off as a 3.5 star heroine for me. She was wishy-washy, insecure and meek.  But…. this is HER journey of self-discovery and growth and in the end I had a 4.5 star heroine; a woman who grew into her own, made decisions, dealt with consequences, took risks</b> and embraced life.My Time in the Affair, told mostly from Mischa’s POV, is a candid look into an affair taking us on sky-high ups and rock-bottom lows.  Both tangible and angsty it deals with how her decision affects her and the people around her.Story is a nail biter all the way to ending and epilogue.  I am content with outcome yet I’d welcome an epilogue further into the future.Spell-binding story-telling!  Thought-provoking and angsty plot!  A to-die-for hero!  Gutsy Stylo!  I predict this story will stay with you!“Come find me…”***Hero rating: 5 starsHeroine rating: 3.5-4.5 starsSexual tension rating: 5 starsSex scenes rating: 5 starsSex scenes frequency: 4 starsPlot rating: 4 starsDialogue rating: 5 starsStorytelling rating: 5 starsStory ending rating: 4.5 starsBook editing rating (5 = no edits spotted): N/A.

"“You are far too beautiful and innocent to be married to someone like me, but I’m too much of a selfish bastard to ever let you go.”Books in series are Stand-alones, but most enjoyed if read in order:Book 1: Bound by HonorBook 2: Bound by DutyBook 3: Bound by HatredBook 4: Bound by TemptationBook 5: UntitledBound by Honor (stand alone, book 1) is a story of an arranged marriage between two previously feuding Italian mafia houses.  At the threat of other large organizations the future head for the New York mob house, Cosa Nostr is set to marry the prettiest girl in the Chicago Outfit.Aria Scuderi is chosen and betrothed, at age fifteen to twenty year old mobster, heir and future Capo dei Capi of the Familia, Luca – The Vice – Vitiello.  She is sent off to an all-girls school awaiting her impending marriage.  Fearful of her husband and of leaving her family, yet bound by honor she marries Luca at age eighteen.The story goes on to follow Luca and Aria during their wedding and beyond as a skittish and anxious Aria has to be seduced by her husband.

I admire her sense of honor and for facing her fears, but her indecisiveness wore on me.  In her defense she was young; with a sheltered upbringing married off to a stranger she knew to be a murderer.Nine words to describe Aria: Naïve, insecure, sweet, timid fearful, observant, loyal, meek and honorable.Bound by Honor, told from Aria’s POV, was a page-turner for me. The unfolding of their story and Luca’s relentless yet patient seduction of Aria made you want them to succeed and get their HEA.  And the ending was sweet but I’d welcome and extended epilogue further into their future.  Quite possibly we will have many opportunities to follow them in the next-coming books about family members and friends.  Up next is book 2, Bound by Duty.Swoon-worthy and honorable hero!

"“I saw her first…”This story is best dived into!  And to get the full story, to understand the plot, grasp the characters and have the answers you have to read this story all the way to the very end.  Even as late as the epilogue there is pertinent information reveled.  That said this story might not be for everyone.  It is complex, gritty, angsty and darkly erotic.Three, Two, One (321) (stand-alone) is the story of ONE woman, Blue on the run from a murky past, something dark that has kept her captive, preoccupied for a long time.  There is guilt, confusion abuse and drug use.  On a rainy day in a dark alley she encounters TWO friends and business partners, producer and cameraman Ark and porn star J.D.I might add that none of the characters are forthcoming; each in their own way broken, confused, even misguided; each with their own hidden agendas; each on a quest for vengeance.So when they come together in that dark alley it’s intense and explosive, THREE soulmates connecting.  The story goes onto follow them as they embark on a dysfunctional, co-dependent highly sexual relationship.  That’s really all you need to know.A journey self-discovery and about coming to terms with one’s past; about trying to change amidst evil, ugly lies and even uglier truths….“I’m going to take enough pictures of this girl to get me through a lifetime of loneliness and regret.”BLUE aka Zoey Zoey Marshall: 23 years/College graduate/Blond hair/Aqua-blue eyes.Eight words to describe Blue: Broken, confused, complex, stubborn, naïve, determined, evasive and deceptive.ARK aka Jacob Barlow: 27 years/Business owner/Porn producer/$$$$/Dark hair/Dark eyes/Tattoo.Eight words to describe Ark: Brooding, conflicted, strong, commanding, smart, ruthless, possessive and deceptive.J.D. aka James David:  25 years/Business owner/Porn star/$$$$/Blond hair/Blue eyes/Tattoo.Eight words to describe J.D.: Charming, obsessive, calculated, stubborn, compulsive, broken, conflicted and deceptive.Complex, dark, twisted and gritty plot!

"“I want you to remember that there is nothing good about me, and there never will be.”Books should be read in order:Book 1: Fear MeBook 2: Fear YouFear Me (book 1) opens up to student Lake Monroe dreading her last year in high school as her tormentor of 10 years Keiran Masters is set to be released from juvenile and be back in school.We also travel back in time to their first meeting and get glimpses into the childhood of two orphans. As the story progresses we learn what sent Keiran away and why he is using that to torment Lake further.The story follows them in current time as Kieran makes his return set on continuing his bullying, but now with sexual overtones.  Their attraction is palpable yet Keiran is hateful, volatile, dominant, relentless, possessive and severe in his seduction and ruining of Lake.But somewhere along the way the story shifts and it becomes so much more than the present and past and their lust. There is mystery to be solved and very dark forces in the sidelines with murky motives.Maybe Kieran isn’t just the too good-looking, flawed guy set on revenging the girl he clearly has a crush on.  And maybe Lake won’t have to remain the submissive girl confused and disgusted by her feelings and desire for him…“Let go of his hand and maybe I'll let you c*me tonight when I f*** you.” I immediately wrestled my hand from Jesse, cursing the fact that I wanted him.“Good girl,” he praised.”KEIRAN MASTERS:  18 years/Heir/Student/Basketball team/Dark hair/Gray eyes/Tattoo/Orphan/6’2”.Keiran Maters is my new favorite BOY alpha.  In story he is described as tall, dark and brooding.  Add possessive, calculated broken, complex, closed off, vindictive, commanding, captivating, charming and sinister to that and you have the Keiran he lets the world see.  The story will peel some of those layers off, but for most part in book 1 he stayed true that.“I’m afraid for him because every day he has to fight the person he is, to be the person he wants to be.”LAKE MONROE:  18 years/Student/Blond hair/Blue-aqua eyes/Virgin/Orphan/5’8”.One word that comes to mind when I think if Lake Monroe is perseverance.  She might not have stood up nor fought back but she survived it with her head held high.  It’s also confusing for her to feel such an intense attraction to her tormentor.

Add to that Nicole’s temper and Rafe’s propensity to want what he wants when he wants it; A power war with both players fighting their attraction ill-equipped to handle feelings and compromise…There you have it!

That both irked and intrigued her.Ten words to describe Nicole: Spoiled, prickly, immature, kind, bossy, smart, focused, hot-headed, secretive and jaded.The Reckless duet, book 1 is truly a whirlwind romance as the too-beautiful-for-their-own-good Rafe and Nicole come to terms with their fierce attraction and lust.  Though dealing with Nicole’s temper and feisty-ness goes to illustrate the lengths Rafe will go to appease her when in all his life he never bent for anyone, right in the beginning, before sex, I felt she was being too difficult at times.Reckless series, book 1 ends with Rafe and Nicole in a good place, no> cliffhanger, but with the understanding that there is more to their story in  book 2 in the Reckless duet.***At the end of book 1 there is a teaser from book 2.

After college she moved to a bigger city and is working as director of operations for a sex toy company.  On a whim, referred by her best friend, she signs up with a top-secret site and orders her own rape, a sexual fantasy of hers.This will prove a life-altering decision for Mia…Hiding in her home is businessman, Tax Draconi,  He provides the best sex and orgasms she ever had… But Tax is not who he pretends to be… and soon Mia finds herself repaying a debt she had no idea show owed. Torn between disgust with herself, contempt and an insane attraction to Tax she is trying to learn Tax’s secrets and his connection to her.But some truths are better untold…“This stranger has become the center of my world.

Story offered the perfect balance of their past and present; lust and contempt; devastation and hope; redemption and forgiveness while keeping me on my toes.It’s beyond sexy, suspenseful, mysterious, partly predictable, angsty, but above all it’s a love story and about making peace with one’s past.  Yet author stayed true to plot by not making everything perfect.  The ending is satisfactory, but I would welcome a bonus epilogue further into their future.Effortless story-telling!  Original, suspenseful and engaging plot!  Smoldering, edgy and ferocious sex scenes!  And… the complex> and unforgettable Tax Dracconi!“Don’t f*** ing act like you don’t like this sh*t Mia.

"""Such a beautiful, f*** ed-up man. Such a waste of perfection.""The `Til Death duet must be read in order:Part 1: 'Til Death, Volume IPart 2: 'Til Death, Volume II`Til Death (book 1) is the story of a deceptive marriage set-up between business owner and potential heir Marcus Tandem and struggling personal assistant Katia Bennett-Tandem.It's prompted by the death of Marcus' grandfather. The will clearly states that Marcus must be married to inherit the business that he has been running for the past 10 years.Katia has no knowledge of the will and thinks this incredible sexy, hot, one-night-stand has gone from player to ready-to-settle down and is pursuing her relentlessly.  But after their marriage she realizes he doesn't love her....The story is told in dual POV alternating between the past, the development of their marriage and present time when everything is put on the line.  There are other stipulations and of course greedy villains, jealous exes and other seedy business associates to complicate matters...""He makes me forgive him with his mouth between my legs.Then with his c*** deep inside me.And I go right back to where I started.""MARCUS TANDEM:  30 years/Business heir/$$$$/Black hair/Brown-black eyes/Tattoo/Piercings.Seven words to describe Marcus Tandem: Conflicted, closed-off, determined, ruthless, deceptive, caring and self-destructive.""Love is for the weak.

From the onset we know that Katia has been misled, but yet the story managed to capture and keep me guessing.  That said I felt torn between conflicting personalities for both Marcus and Katia and the plot seemed disjointed at times and a bit overloaded with millionaires, bikers and criminals, but some of that will probably clarify itself with the unfolding of part 2, 'Til Death, Volume II and the conclusion of their story!Awesome book cover!

He seduced and pursued her while warning her off.Karissa, who was coddled and naïve, wanted to believe the best in people and her situation. Nothing could have prepared her for the brutal truth nor the shocking events leading up to the revelation and chaotic ending.Torture to Her Soul (book 2), told from Naz’s POV, picks up right after book 1’s violent and shocking ending.  Their lives are in turmoil and Naz is desperately trying to bridge the gap and open the lines of communication.  Karissa is hurt, shocked and angry, but she cannot deny still feeling a connection and attraction to Naz.Naz can force and put pressure, but does he want to?  It’s a slow re-building of trust based on revelations and confessions.  But there is more to come plus the evil all around them is closing in.  Soon it’s not just about them finding their way back together rather them finding a way out….  But do they want to?It’s a journey of good versus evil, truths and lies, joy and pain and the fact that everything in life comes at a price…“We're a tragedy in the making. The game of tug-of-war we're playing will end up destroying us, because she doesn't have it in her to surrender, and I can't let go.”IGNAZIO VITALE, Naz:  36 years/Freelancer/Brown hair/Blue eyes.Ignazio Vitale, Naz is a tortured, broken soul yet reflective.  When tragedy struck him at age eighteen instead of grieving he sought the path of vengeance.  It is a heart-wrenching, candid glimpse into the life of a man who trusts no one, leans on no one, rarely sleeps, barely eats and obsessively organizes his life.Eight words to describe Naz: Mysterious, mercurial, closed-off, imperfect, broken, ruthless, possessive and nurturing.“It's hard to feel alive when you've been obliterated inside, hard to feel real when you no longer remember how to dream.”KARISSA REED, Kissimmee:  18 years/College student/Brown hair.Eight words to describe Karissa Reed, Kissimmee: Naïve, lonely insecure, impressionable, smart, inadequate, immature and sheltered.“She looks broken, but so godd*mn beautiful. I want to put her back together. I want to break her down even more.”Torture to Her Soul is raw and violent.  Story does not attempt to sugar-coat the truth of what and who Naz is.  It’s about redemption for the irredeemable as many of their issues have no answer, no fixing, no redemption…  When reading one has to be prepared not to get it all.  As much as I think I needed my HEA, everything wrapped up in a tight bow, I feel the author did a good job of staying true to their situation.The epilogue and bonus chapters were amazing, not sure I could have handled story without them.  I’d welcome more further into their future, but I am happy were it left them!Candid POV from a very memorable hero!  Captivating plot!

I cannot wait to see where story takes him, hopefully for a fall into whopped, but that remains to be seen as there is many secrets surrounding him.Ten words to describe Jax: Sinister, depraved, commanding, broken, cynical, enigmatic, elusive, calculated, secretive and vengeful.CHARLOTTE LUCAS:  24 years/Recent college grad/Journalism degree/Dark brown/Green eyes.Eight words to describe  Charlotte Lucas: Sweet, timid, unassuming, determined, meek, smart, focused and loyal.Resist is the perfect opening to what s looks to be a very kinky, sexy, suspenseful and at times dark read.  Set against the backdrop of the depraved games of Jax, who might just have gotten away with murder...  It ends with a cliffy, leading right to part 2, Ravage for the continuation of their story.Sinister and oh so swoon-worthy hero!  Suspenseful and kinky plot!  Excellent storytelling!

"""That's life, Chloe.  That's living.""Alarm (stand-alone) is corporate project manager Chloe Ellison, Clo's story, told entirely from her POV.  It opens up to her mundane, cautious, lonely and rather OCD existence being frustrated with her boss and reflecting over her non-existent dating life.  After a night-out with friends she is shocked to wake up in a stranger's bed, a very tattooed and wickedly handsome stranger's bed I might add.Aiden Hunter claims to work in sales and is just visiting.  He rescued an intoxicated Chloe after she passed out. He did not have his way with her comatose body.  Once that is sorted out, neither can deny that there is an attraction.  On a whim Aiden invites Chloe to fly back to Florida with him and visit for a week.Even though the ""alarm"" is going off in Chloe's head she decides to go out on a limb and take him up on his offer.  The story goes on to follow their budding romance during the visit and beyond as Aiden pushes and coaches Chloe to live a little both inside and outside the bedroom.Set against the backdrop of ""who is Aiden Hunter?"" and ""what is he hiding?"" it quickly becomes clear that these polar opposites have much more in common and Chloe isn't the only one needing lessons in living...AIDEN HUNTER:  27 years/Sales/Black hair/Hazel eyes/Beard/Tattoos.Seven words to describe Aiden Hunter: Mysterious, observant, broken, enigmatic, chivalrous, spontaneous and loyal.CHLOE ELLISON, Clo:  27 years/Project management/Brown hair/Blue eyes/OCD.Seven words to describe Chloe Ellison, Clo: Sweet, reflective, meek, OCD, lonely, unhappy and non-confrontational.Alarm offers a little of everything; romance, self-reflection and growth, steamy sex scenes, humorous situations, adventures and the unfolding of a mystery.  Story takes Aiden and Chloe on a roller-coaster of events and emotions only to arrive at a well-deserved sweet yet somewhat rushed ending.  I'd welcome an extended epilogue from Aiden's POV!It's a message of hope and new beginnings!
