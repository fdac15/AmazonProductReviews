"Another book of Jessica Sorensen's that leaves you craving more!!!I love the way this paranormal series is going. Alana's character is fantastic. She is tough and resilient, everything I love in a heroine. Even through all the things she faces, she's a stand up character. I loved all the mystery and suspense in this one. I'm dying to see where the next book will take me!

"When I first saw the blurb for this book, I was crazy excited to read it. It’s got all kinds of things I love and I just knew it would be a winner. I mean, look at this…Student/Teacher18/28Forbidden LoveTabooSteamyWritten by JA Huss Yeah, it was pretty much a guarantee I was going to love this book! 18 starts out on our heroine, Shannon’s 18th birthday. She is having a pretty awful day  and as it goes on, it only seems to get worse.She learns that in order to graduate, she will have to take evening science and math classes for the rest of her senior year. When she gets to her math class, and see’s her teacher, she’s shocked. Mateo is young (well, 28), good looking and completely inappropriate in the best way.I loved Mateo and Shannon. And I loved Shannon’s friend, Danny (aka Sunday) lots too. Huss always writes the best twists to her stories. They’re never exactly what you expect them to be. By the end of this one the drama and angst had me biting my nails to see what would happen. I love that I always expect the unexpected when it comes to her books. It’s refreshing to get an original story line every time you read a book by an author you love.Eighteen is a sexy, well written, fast paced, taboo and all around great read. If you haven’t read anything by JA Huss, you don't know what you’re missing out on! If you have, you know her, love her, and expect greatness in every read. She always delivers.  This one didn’t disappoint!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGZ6H4YCJQCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01861S9IO#wasThisHelpful","R1YGZ6H4YCJQCE","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve read the first two books in Linde’s All that Glitters series, you know Trihn. She is one of Bryna’s best friends. Emeralds is a prequel of sorts to what happened with Trihn leading up to her move to Vegas.Trihn is a New York girl. She’s a dancer. An overachiever. The summer before her freshman year of college, something unthinkable to her happens… she falls in love. There is this guy named Preston that completely sweeps her off her feet. She’s never felt this way before and the more time she spends with Preston, the harder she falls.I shouldn’t be surprised when Linde pulls out these big guns, but it seems I always am. This book shocked me. And I was a little (lot of) outraged. The turn the story took… just wow. I knew something would happen but this? Honestly, I’m a pretty easy going reader but this part of the story made me go from loving this story to not feeling all the love. By the end I felt good about the choices Trihn made, but there was a moment… Every reader has a few things that just irk them and this book pushed those buttons. Even so, I am anxious to see where the angst queen herself takes Trihn’s story. Kyla has a way of making her characters flawed and real, so even when you’re frustrated with them, I like that they’re not cookie cutter characters. They make mistakes, screw up, and are real. It’s life. With the next book, I’m curious to what kind of appearances Ian, Preston and Lydia will make. You have my full attention here!If you’re looking for a story with great writing, a lot of steam, even more angst- this is one I would recommend for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGQGZK8BSG23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RQ41OC#wasThisHelpful","RIGQGZK8BSG23","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most women (myself included) have had some sort of body image issue(s) at some point in their lives. If you are included in the ‘most women’ this is a story written for you with a character you’ll be able to relate with. Harper did an excellent job writing about something that is prevalent in our society, yet not spoken about very often. Willow’s story of self discovery, moving forward and loving herself isn’t always easy, but it’s a beautiful tale.Willow Tate is having one of the worst days of her life. She’s getting divorced. And one of her biggest tormenters is not only there to witness it, but is part of the reason. Blessing in disguise- that is what this divorce is. And at her lawyer’s office, she knows why. She meets someone named Kane Masters. She knows who Kane is right away, he’s famous. And he seems to genuinely like Willow. The fact that someone like Kane could like someone like Willow blows her mind at first, but it is also a catalyst in her changing her life an accepting herself.Willow and Kane get thrown back in the same place at the same time once again. And it just so happens to be another awful day for Willow. This time is different though. Willow speaks her mind and stands up to those who bully her. Kane witnesses it all. He can’t believe anyone would treat Willow this way. Kane is in Hollywood and surrounded by people who aren’t real all day long. Willow is a breath of fresh air and someone he wants and desires.Willow and Kane’s relationship is one of patience, understanding, trust and love. I love how much Kane is there for Willow. He gets her and her issues and he supports her wholeheartedly.I love to read and when I read, I love to feel a connection to my characters. I love that I felt that connection with Willow. She and Kane weren’t perfect characters, but they were perfect for each other. I loved the characters and the growth Willow had. Kane was as near perfect as a hero can get.This book had a wonderful message- being perfectly imperfect is okay. It’s okay to embrace the things about you that you don’t love. In fact, some of the very things you are self conscious about just may be the thing that someone else falls in love with. It’s a story that gives hope, a story that is about being brave, standing up for yourself and changing the way you see yourself. Thank you, Harper, for tackling such a difficult topic. Well done!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QR2I21FP4KKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017O4W3V8#wasThisHelpful","R3QR2I21FP4KKB","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Truth, lies, secrets, betrayals… Slut has all that. I’ve been anxiously awaiting the conclusion to Suit since the moment I finished. I had to know what was real, who was who and where these characters were going to go in this messed up situation. In Slut, two new and very important characters were introduced. Through them, Gabby found a way to possibly regain some of  her memories and find out the truth. The funny thing about the truth… there are some truths that you wish you never knew once you find them out. Certain things you can never unlearn and they effect your life and how you perceive things.Gabriella and Paxton have one of the most dysfunctional love stories I have ever read. EVER. Paxton is one of those characters I love to hate and hate to love. There were points in both books I was like… dude- really? Then there are moments that made me love him. Gabriella is still as strong as ever. She is set to find the truth at any cost. I loved that she didn’t put up with Pax when he was acting crazy. As much as he likes control, I think he liked that this new Gabby stood up for herself.What I loved about this series is that it was really fast paced, interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat guessing. It was unpredictable in a lot of ways. I do wish that as a reader we could have gotten some Paxton perspective. I think that would have made the entire story. I don’t feel like we were really clued in to what his secret was. Also, I wanted a little more closure at the end. I’m hoping maybe this author will give us an extra scene or novella…. inquiring minds want to know ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R154GB9A6EL81U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0184EPJ40#wasThisHelpful","R154GB9A6EL81U","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joanna Wylde has a fantastic thing going with her Reaper’s series. They are some of my favorite biker books. They are always a great and balanced mix of raw, steamy and sweet. Painter’s book had less of the sweet and more of the rough and raw, but I still enjoyed this second chance romance very much.Reaper’s Fall starts with our boy, Painter in jail. He’s given up his freedom for his club, but he’s close to getting released. While in jail, he’s had Melanie’s letters to get him through.When Painter returns home, he doesn’t know how to act around her. So he tries shutting her out. Melanie doesn’t stand for that. So Painter decides he can give her friendship, but that’s all. Even though it’s so very obvious they both want so much more.Melanie and Painter can’t stay just friends for very long. It’s impossible to fight the attraction and chemistry that has been brewing between them. Friendship turns to sex, and sex turns into even more. For the first time ever, Painter is willing to try a relationship with someone. I loved seeing Painter fight his feelings, then say screw it and go get his girl, get what he’s always wanted.Things for Mel and Painter are perfect… for a short while. Then something changes between them. And Painter makes a choice that costs him a lot.The last two books have eluded to Painter and Melanie. I was ecstatic to get them together, to get their own story. And there was so much I loved about their story. Painter is an artist, I loved that spin. And Melanie was a nurse- being a nurse myself, I love reading stories where the main character is one as well. Those times in the beginning when they were together and making it work, they left me with the biggest smile on my face.There were so many great parts, but the big conflict in the story lasted far too long for my tastes. This ‘grudge’ lasted entirely too long and turned a character I genuinely loved (Mel) into a character that ended up annoying me for the longest time. That is the only reason this isn’t a 5 star read for me. Everything else, the writing the characters, the other parts of the story line, they were all spot on.If you’re looking for a great biker’s series, the Reaper’s is where it’s at. If you’re looking for a second chance romance with a damaged character, an unplanned pregnancy, angst, romance, steam and the cutest kid ever, pick this one up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TA87XKQ2ZB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R17TA87XKQ2ZB0","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The plot was unique, the story was beautiful and that ending… my god I had tears running down my face. It was exceptional.

"Romeo and Rimmel… I’m sad that their story has come to an end. You can tell I’m loving an audio book when I’m listening to it more than I’m reading my current book, and I flew through these three audios. The Hashtag series is a fun read with some steam, some swoon, a bit of drama and a lot of heart. You will fall in love with these characters.Rimmel is strong, devoted and loving. Romeo is so dedicated and protective of his girl. There is a lot about Rimmel’s past that comes up in this story. It’s a hurdle for their relationship. Dealing with that, along with Romeo healing from what happened in book 2, and it’s a lot. But they are strong. And they love each other more than anything. And I LOVE that about them!As much as I love this couple, my favorite thing about this book was actually Braden. The brother/sister relationship he had with Rimmel was perfection! Every time those two had a scene together I had the biggest grin on my face. I’m so excited for his books.If you’re looking for a great new adult read to listen to on audio, I highly recommend these!

"#Hater is book 2 in the Hashtag series and starts off right where #Nerd takes off. Romeo and Rimmel are together and happy. Rimmel has come of out her shell some- she hasn’t made any huge changes, but she is a little more confident and changes her style a bit but she’s still that lovable #nerd we loved in the first book. And Romeo is still the same charming, sweet and swoony guy. He makes it clear to anyone and everyone in Alpha U that Rimmel is his girl and nothing will change that.As the story goes on, you get to see their relationship grow. Then someone out for revenge has to throw a wrench in it. Zach from the first book is out to get Romeo and he will do anything to achieve that goal. And what better way to hurt him then to go after the girl he loves?#Hater had one of those endings that makes you want to start the next book asap- thank goodness it’s out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFAHV1S5GX8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S394I7Q#wasThisHelpful","RIFAHV1S5GX8I","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year when I read Raze, I went from a normal fan of Tillie Cole’s to super fan girl status. It was one of my favorite books of the year. Then I get the sequel, and I’m nervous. Will it be as good as the first? Not as good? Better? While reading, I was so impressed with Tillie’s writing, the characters and the storyline. I can say with absolute certainty that this book was just as good as Raze. I actually liked it more (which I wasn’t sure was possible).Talia Tolstaia is a Bravata Princess, the daughter of a boss, and the sister to Luka. She is strong willed and independent. Even though she’s used to being alone, that’s not the way she wants it. She wants love like everyone else.Zaal Kostava doesn’t ever remember being a name. Only a number. He’s 221. But he had a life once, a family. And Luka feels he owes that family, one person in particular. Luka does what he has to do. He gets 221 out of the death fighting and tries to help him.Talia never imagined this Kostava would be someone she would feel anything towards, someone she would show compassion too. The Kostava’s have always been enemies to their family. There is bad blood there. It doesn’t stop Talia from caring for Zaal.Zaal cant’ ever remember being cared for. He doesn’t know what to think about this woman showing kindness towards him. She cares. Her caring makes him feel things he’s never felt before. Instead of feeling rage, he feels calm when she’s around.This story is connected to Raze in many ways and can in no way be read as a standalone. Not only do you get Zaal and Talia’s POV, you also get some chapters that are Luka’s POV and I think that adds a lot to the story.Zaal was a character with such strength and beauty. Through all the torment he endured, he was able to move past that damaged past, sacrifice and survive. The fact that he is able to trust or love at all is baffling to me. Talia was also an incredibly special character. She was willing to put everything on the line for love and I adored her for it.Reap is a fast paced, highly emotional, beautifully written story of true love conquering all. It’s raw, dark and gritty, but also stunning and romantic. Reap is an addictive book you won’t want to put down. I can’t recommend these books enough! Tillie Cole has an amazing series here and after that sneak peak into the next book, I think the best may be yet to come! I cannot wait for it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XT0XRYBNQEWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZON5LN4#wasThisHelpful","R2XT0XRYBNQEWZ","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is nothing quite like a Colleen Hoover book. She is one of those authors that leaves a stamp on her work. Her plots seem to have this special twist, her story lines are always unique and her characters are witty, wonderful and flawed. When I read November 9 I expected greatness. This is a CoHo book. And I wasn't disappointed.November 9 is a day on the calendar. One day out of 365. It’s a day that I’ve never really thought about, but from now on, I don’t think this date will pass without me thinking of Ben, Fallon, and their story. When I read the blurb for this book, I was intrigued. At first I thought- such a cool idea. Then I thought, how is this going to work?This is a book that put me through the ringer. My emotions were all over the place. It made me feel. It made me stay up all night reading. There were points I was sad, points i was angry (it’s been a while since I’ve been this upset at a character…. still not over it LOL), and points my heart was bursting full. I want to talk about the story, but I can’t talk about the story. It’s one of those you don’t want to know to much about. Be surprised and let the emotions consume you.November 9 is the perfect mix of humor, twists and turns, love, angst and it has that Colleen Hoover stamp that is unmistakable. You will laugh, you will cry, if you’re like me, you might be so full of frustration that you want to throw your kindle a time or two, but by the ending, you’re left with an unforgettable story that is real, raw and riveting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T0GWT1UYFHCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI1S8#wasThisHelpful","R3T0GWT1UYFHCN","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I Was Yours is a book I’ve been looking forward to for a while. This is a second chance romance, and it’s angsty, heartbreaking and emotional. I love all of Samantha Towle’s books, and although this one wasn’t my favorite, it was still enjoyable for me.Adam and Evie had an epic year of romance when they were younger. They fell in love fast and hard, and even though they were young, they were happy and in love. They knew for sure this was the real deal. So they got married. She was 18, he was 19, and they were determined to make it work. Then a week later, Evie left. No explanation, just her rings and annulment papers left behind. Adam looked, but couldn’t find her.They’ve been apart ten years, and neither have moved on. Not in the way it counts. Not in the heart. Adam wants answers. He needs closure on why Evie left him… but she doesn’t think either are ready for her to give him those answers.Past Adam and present Adam are so different. I loved young Adam, he was the best… Adam now- well, he has his moments. I understand why he is the way he is, thats for sure. Evie is great and even though I wanted to yell at her to come out with it already I still liked her a lot. The main reason this wasn’t a 5 for me was because it was fairly predictable. I was able to tell pretty much straight away why Evie left. I understood and sympathized with her reasoning, I just wish it would have been a little harder to guess.If you’re looking for a feel good love story, this probably isn’t the book for you. It takes a lot of heartache and angst to get to the happy. I did love the way the story ended and I love Towle’s writing, so this gets a 4 star rating from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1963AJ3NEISG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01692EJJU#wasThisHelpful","R1963AJ3NEISG1","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lachlan’s life has been far different from Kayla’s, and even though neither one are looking for a relationship of any kind, they are drawn to one another.Lachlan is visiting San Fransisco to help out Bram. He’s a rugby player and has to get back to Edinburg soon enough, but he’s here now. Once he meets Kayla, he can’t keep his mind off of her. Or his hands. He’s never felt this way about a woman and he doesn’t know what to do with his feelings. All he knows is that he’s not ready to leave Kayla behind. So he does the unthinkable and asks her to come with him. Kayla knows this is crazy but she goes.Their time in Scotland was beautiful, emotional and devastating. Getting to see a different side of Lachlan and learning more about his past gutted me. I loved this characters so much. Every broken part of him. Lachlan has an ugly past. The man he is today is so different than the man he used to be. Lachlan helps stray and unwanted dogs. It’s such an admirable thing and a huge part of the story. He knows what it feels like to be cast aside and unwanted and it breaks my heart every time I think about his past and why he feels such a connection to those dogs.Lachlan has never completely dealt with his past. He is and will always be fighting a war with himself, but Kayla see’s those parts of him, and loves him anyway.As I mentioned earlier, this is a top favorite of mine this year. I can’t think of one thing I didn’t love about this story. It was long, but it didn’t feel long. I didn’t want it to end. I loved these characters and their story fiercely. The Play was full of romance, steam, some angst, and tons of emotion. It’s a story that will hit you right in the feels and you all know thats my favorite kind. The writing is gorgeous and the characters are beautifully flawed and perfectly imperfect. I can’t recommend this one enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V05HS1W2SRQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OQN4AC#wasThisHelpful","R3V05HS1W2SRQP","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I was listening to the audio of #Nerd, the thought that kept running through my head was ‘this would make a fantastic movie’. In fact, it reminded me of a lot of those movies we watch where the hot guy on campus falls for the geek etc. Even if it wasn’t the most original story line ever, it was still a super enjoyable read.Rimmel studying to be a veterinarian. She’s a nerd who keeps to herself. She spends most of her time studying and volunteering at the local animal shelter. As a condition of her full scholarship, Rim is told she has to tutor another student. Not just any student, Roman ‘Romeo’ Anderson. The quarterback of the football team and hottest guy on campus.Romeo needs to keep his grades up so he can keep playing football. His goal is to make it in the NFL. Right now, he’s pledging to a frat that will help him get there. Rimmel and Romeo butt heads at first, but as time goes on, they start to like each other. Then there is the frat, the challenges, and things get very messy.Romeo and Rimmel were both great characters. I  loved that Rimmel didn’t fawn all over Romeo like every other girl on campus. I also loved that Romeo stuck to his guns and ended up being the type of guy she deserved. This was a fun new adult read and I’m looking forward to reading more about Rimmel, Romeo and his bestie Braden!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9K25A1FTQID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P55CRPG#wasThisHelpful","R3H9K25A1FTQID","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the More Than book that I was most nervous about reading. It’s Dylan’s book and we all know Dylan as the strong and silent type. After reading 4 books with the More Than gang, we don’t know much about him except he’s in the service, he’s the quiet type, and he’s got a fantastic group of friends.I didn’t know what to expect when I started this story, but it blew me away. I didn’t expect Dylan to become a favorite of mine, but he did. It should surprise me that this happened, but it doesn’t. Not really. Jay has the ability to make me fall in love with fictional characters frequently.Dylan is up there with Logan and Lucy as one of my most beloved characters of this series. I am so impressed that Jay was able to make me love this character so much. I loved Dylan with his dad and brother. I loved the relationship that Dylan had with his girl. It wasn’t perfect. Not even close, but it was right. There were so many emotions and feels, but the laughs were there too. They were that kind of couple.Jay’s stories are equal parts full of heartwarming moments, heartbreaking moments, humor, friendship, and love. This particular book even had a few moments that shocked me. Moments that devastated me. Yes- this book devastated me. I’m talking reading for an hour straight with tears rolling down my face. Dylan is truly broken. Something has happened to him and he’s not sure he can ever get past it. His girl is there for him, even though he constantly is trying to push her away.The end of this story was perfect. It made every second that was hard to read worth it. Jay’s writing style is beyond special. No one writes quite like her. What can I say about this book/ this series that I haven’t said before? It is legit fantastic. It will make you smile, make you laugh, make you cry and give you ALL THE FEELS. It’s that one series I am constantly recommending because I want everyone to experience the greatness of the ‘More World’ and fall in love with these characters the same way that I have. This was a fantastic way to end a series so close to my heart. I’m sensing an epic re-read sometime in my very near future. I’m not ready to say goodbye to these characters!More Than Enough is a 5+ star favorite for me and a book I highly recommend. Join in and experience the mayhem!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13T97QLGELASS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017O6EWFQ#wasThisHelpful","R13T97QLGELASS","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bet is one of those books that brought the laughs. If you’re looking for something light and easy that will keep a smile on your face, this would be a good one to pick up.This is a story about childhood best friends Kacey and Jake. But it’s not just about them. Jake’s older brother, Travis is in the mix. You see Jake and Kasey were always best friends, even dated for a while, but Travis is the guy who’s always cared for Kacey. She just didn’t know it. Travis and Kacey’s relationship as children/teens was less than sweet and loving. They picked on each other in a good natured way.Kacey has been away from the Titus boys for a while, but when Jake needs her help with a ‘fake engagement’ he makes her an offer she can’t refuse….I was so confused the first bit of this book. I had no idea if I was supposed to like Jake or hate him. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to love Travis, or if Jake was the one who would get his act together and steal Kacey’s heart. At first I thought… love triangle? Really? But by the end you realize there was never any competition. One man truly cares for and loves Kacey and one doesn’t. Not the way she deserves anyway.All these characters were great in different ways, but there was one that stood out above the rest. The grandma. She was fun, spunky, and laugh out loud funny. I really want to read the next book just to get more grandma!I listened to the audio version and it was one of those cases where I think it was more enjoyable in audio than reading. The narration was great, you could tell the narrators were really getting into the story and that’s always fun! Sometimes you just need a light read to listen to that will make you laugh and smile. If you’re looking for a hilarious, quirky and sweet romance, this is one I’d recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MUF9OYJMVST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI40KQA#wasThisHelpful","R29MUF9OYJMVST","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book I’ve read by Mariah Dietz, but it certainly won’t be the last. The Weight of Rain is a beautifully written romance that is more than just a love story. It’s a story of self discovery, of being the best you possible. A story that will give you hope and by the end, make you a very happy reader.When I started this book I wasn’t so sure what it was about. The blurb is fairly vague but several trusted friends recommended this author so I jumped in. I’m so happy I did. Lo is an artist. She’s a student. And she had one life chaining night with a guy and she can’t remember it all. She remembers so much about him, but not any important details. Like his name. She can’t stop thinking about him, can’t stop drawing him, but life goes on.Then she finds him in the most unlikely way she could have imagined.Lo and King. Lo is a character with a lot of heart. She’s passionate about the things and the people she loves. King is also passionate about the people and things he loves. Both have to fight to follow their dreams and find that balance between what and who they love.I think my favorite part of this story was that it wasn’t all about King and Lo. There were so many secondary characters that completely stole my heart! I loved Mercedes so much, and I really think we need a Kash book. He was fantastic as well. So was Summer. And Allie. And the list goes on and on! When a book has this many wonderful characters, it’s always a great thing. As I mentioned before, this is very much a romance, but that’s not all it is. I can’t tell you how many quotes I highlighted that had nothing to do with the romance aspect of the story. There were so many that stuck out to me, but this was my absolute favorite quote in the book.“Being nice isn't hard. Life isn’t a competition against another person. It’s a competition against yourself. You are working to be the best version of yourself possible.”The first half of this story completely sucked me in. I could not put it down once I started it. I stayed up way to late reading and it moved very fast. There were parts after the middle that seemed to drag a bit for me, but then it picked up again towards the end. I loved the way it ended, I thought it was a perfect way to end their story.Overall, this is a new adult romance I would highly recommend. Dietz’s writing is stunning and Lo and King’s story is on you won’t want to miss out on!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJCKD2I93SI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NWMO62#wasThisHelpful","R3UJCKD2I93SI0","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Proposition is a story that is easy to fall in love with. Not only did I fall in love with the two main characters, but all the secondary ones as well. There have been some great spin-off stories (Pesh’s story is actually my favorite of the series) so when I saw Katie was writing a novella for Emma’s BFF Casey, I knew I wanted to read it straight away.The Predicament was short, sweet and steamy. It followed Casey and her sometimes wild but well meaning antics. Casey just had a baby recently and is trying to get that fire lit back under her marriage. She wants that spark back in the bedroom. She was a fun character, I adored Nate, and I loved the Aiden scene towards the beginning! I laughed, I smiled and I enjoyed this story lots. I recommend for fans of this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JY231FQ294VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DVIHYY#wasThisHelpful","R1JY231FQ294VK","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shame was completely different than the first two books in this series. I did like the book a good bit, and actually some parts that were way dark intrigued me, but for some reason I didn’t fall in love with this one the way that I did Gabe and Wes’s story. So even though it’s a 3-3.5 it’s a strong 3-3.5 and still one I’d recommend to someone looking for a twisty, dark and emotional new adult.Lisa has a past that she’s not proud of. A shameful past that still haunts her to this day. Partly because of this past, she doesn’t date or get involved with anyone. Then she meets Tristan, aka Professor Blake (there isn’t a big age gap, she’s early 20’s and he’s 27) and things change. Lisa’s secrets are always right there, on the edge of coming out- but Tristan has secrets too. These secrets could completely break them both.Shame was full of twists and turns and at the end there were things that came out that I didn’t see coming at all. I listened to the audio of this book and the narration was good. Although I could sympathize with Lisa, I never truly connected to her or Tristan, which is a big reason why I didn’t love this as much as the first two.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUFCXO9JJ3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O746SJ2#wasThisHelpful","R3OUFCXO9JJ3I","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to steamy romantic suspense, Angelica Chase is one of the best. Her plots are always well thought out with twists and turns along the way, and you can always count on her stories to be very hot and well written.If you’ve read Angelica’s The Excess series, you may remember Taylor. She is business partners with Nina and a strong willed heroine. Taylor is the way she is because of her past. She puts up a wall thats nearly impossible to break through.This is first and foremost Taylor’s story and Taylor was by far my favorite character of this book. She’s strong, but she’s also stubborn in the best way. I loved getting to look into her past. There is so much story here with Taylor. The past focuses on her and Laz (Crazy, I know… but most of the book I was rooting for Laz ;) ) And then there is the present. In the present Taylor meets someone who gains her attention in a big way for the first time in a long time. Daniello.The scenes between Daniello and Taylor were intense and steamy. Daniello is still a mystery to me and I’m waiting till the next book to give my final verdict on him.The last 25% of this book went by so fast. Once things went down, it was insane (in the best way possible) Once again Chase delivers with a sizzling, unpredictable and captivating read. I thought I knew what direction this story was going to take, but that last chapter just proved I really knew nothing. I can’t wait for the second part of Taylor’s story. I’m anxious to find out how things will turn out for her…","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18GM2WF965TEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017EA6X9U#wasThisHelpful","R18GM2WF965TEM","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve read Ignite by Tessa Teevan,  you already know and love Jeremy and Sierra. They were two of my favorite characters in that book. Going into Fusion, you know that Jeremy and Sierra have been together a long time, they’re happy and in love, and that they’ve been best friends since they’ve been kids. Let me tell you, there isn’t much I love more in a book than a good friends to lovers story and this is one of the best! Getting to see two characters you already know and love grow up together and fall in love- it was wonderful!A young Jeremy Banks meets little 8 year old Sierra Sullivan and it’s best friends at first sight. They have TMNT to thank for that. From children, to teenagers, this couple is the very best of friends and always have each others backs. As they become teens, both start to develop feelings for the other. I can imagine it’s not easy becoming attracted and falling in love with your best friend. What if it’s not mutual? What if you tell them, they don’t feel the same and everything changes? It’s scary for both Jeremy and Sierra. The lines have blurred between friends and more than friends and neither know how to bring it up…It’s hard to say what my favorite thing was about this book- I loved it all. The beginning when they were kids, I especially loved the middle when they were trying to figure it out and the love was fresh and new. The last part was also great when you got to see them happy and in love. Don’t get me wrong, their relationship isn’t perfect. They go through their fair share of issues and heartbreak. But they have each other through it all.Jeremy Banks is a favorite of Tessa’s Explosive men. He is by far the most hilarious, and he is so devoted to his girl. I loved how funny this story was, the friendship to love and the romance. I laughed, I cried and I swooned. I’ve read about all of Tessa’s books and this was her strongest writing to date. For fans of the Explosive series, this is one you won’t want to miss out on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLXVE21247YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AK0UKM#wasThisHelpful","RCLXVE21247YH","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Childstar 1 is the first part of a 3 part series. Once I started reading this, I flew through it and read it cover to cover in about an hour or so. I couldn’t put it down. I am so fascinated by these two child stars, their connection, their story, and the direction it’s going to take. I usually don’t read a ton of these novellas/serials. I read one a while back and the author made us wait over 9 months for an installment (insanity!) but knowing these have set release dates (10/27, 11/10 and 11/17) I was okay with jumping in! I’m so happy I did.Amelia London is America’s sweetheart and a well known child star. She wants to break away from that title and jump into something new. A popular book to movie called Sinners Like Us. The role is something totally new for her, and it’s exactly what she needs. The only problem… the male lead has already been cast. And it’s none other than her ex and another child star, Noah Sloan.Noah Sloan is America’s bad boy. But he’s so much more than that! Just wait until you read his side of things… Noah has not surprisingly been cast as Damon (the bad boy) in Sinners Like Us. He is a fan favorite. When he hears Amelia is being cast as Blair, he has mixed feelings. He’s not sure how he’s gong to deal with seeing her again. About playing her love interest. With Noah, things aren’t always as they seem.The secrets, the lies, the betrayal…. Gah! I am so intrigued by the start of this series and cannot wait for the next installment! I love reading stories like this! The entire time I was reading I was thinking about one of my favorite series being turned into a movie and the process etc. Then at the end when some bombs were dropped I was like what? JJ McAvoy always seems to surprise me in her books. Even ones like this, that would seem predicable, she comes out with something I didn’t see coming.

"Toxic is the second book in Rachel Van Dyken’s Ruin series and I may be in the minority, but I actually thought it was better than the first! Don’t get me wrong, the first book was very good, but there was something about Gabe’s story that hit me right in the feels. It wasn’t so much the romance or the relationship aspect of the story I loved so much, it was mostly just Gabe and his back story that I found interesting and heartbreakingly good.Gabe Hyde appears to be like any other college student. His life might seem like any other guy’s on the outside, but he has secrets and so much going on behind the scenes it’s hard to wrap your head around it. His past is always there, hidden.Gabe has his cousin Lisa and friends Wes and Kierstan. They are the only ones close to him, and even some of them don’t know the truth about his past. He doesn’t let people get too close. And then comes Saylor. College freshman, music major, and somehow the one girl who is able to plant herself into Gabe’s past, present and future. Music is something both of them have in common. Even when Gabe is difficult (which is more often than not) the music can bring them together.As I said before, the romance aspect of this story wasn’t necessarily the focus and I was okay with that. Gabe’s story was powerful. I love when characters are so much more than what meets the eye. Saylor is understanding and patient with Gabe, especially when she finds out what is really going on in his life. The last 10-15% and the things she did for him really won me over. I ended up loving her by the end as well.This is a tearjerker, I cried more than once while listening to this book. It can be read as a stand alone, but I would recommend reading <i>Ruin</i> first. It’s where you first get introduced to Gabe, plus I loved Wes and Kiersten’s story. I also want to point out that this audio was so much better than Ruin’s. Both of the narrator’s fit the characters well and it was good listening! If you’re in the mood for an emotional NA read, this is a series I would recommend picking up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZK5OI3VFH7KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICQXDQM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZK5OI3VFH7KD","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ruin is an emotional, raw and beautiful love story that was equal parts heartbreaking and heartwarming. I laughed, I cried, I loved, I smiled. Overall, a very good read.Wes- aka Wolf- is one of those heroes  you find yourself loving straight away. He’s sweet, funny, charming and just a wee bit cocky. He’s a big shot football player and well known on campus. He’s also a RA at a freshman dorm. He runs into Kiersten and is instantly drawn to her. There is something different about her. She’s innocent, kind, and he can tell she’s holding on to some sort of pain. Due to her innocent nature, he starts calling her Lamb. The Wolf and Lamb nick names were too cute.Wes has a secret. A secret we readers find out early on. As Wes and Kiersten’s relationship moves forward, I wanted him to tell her so badly. But I understood why he didn’t. Kiersten has baggage and a past and Wes is focused on helping her move forward and really live her life. Their story was beautiful.I don’t want to talk too much about the story because this is one of those books that could be very easily spoiled. I did however love the ending. It’s one of those books that have been out for a while and I keep asking myself why did I wait so long to read it??? I enjoyed the story, Wes and Kiersten were fantastic and GABE was a wonderful side character! I can’t wait to read his story next!P.S. I listened to the audio book of Ruin… this is one of those times I wish I would have quit the audio and switched to reading. The male narration was terrible. It sounded like Kiersten was a college freshman (as it should) and Wes was a 50 year old creeper. His voice did not match the character at all. Just a heads up for my audible peeps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJELI1B9EEM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EH3EIFO#wasThisHelpful","R1OJELI1B9EEM0","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I fell in love with Alex and Gemma’s story in Shattered Promises. It’s a fantastic paranormal series. When I heard Jessica Sorensen was doing a spin off with their child, Alana, I knew I had to read it straight away. As an fyi- you can read this as a stand-alone, but I felt like I connected better to the story and characters because I had read the original series.Alana comes from a family of powerful Keeper’s and she’s just waiting- waiting until she gets her mark. The thing that will signify her strength, power and place in the family. The mark she gets isn’t what she’s expecting. Alana has only ever thought being a Keeper is in her future, to find out she’s been given the mark of a Guardian is quite a shock.Alana was a wonderful character. I loved her strength, wit and determination. It was great to see more of the characters I loved from the original series and I’m very interested to learn more about this Jaxon that Alana has been paired with at the Academy.Entranced ended in a bit of a cliffy, but that didn’t shock me. It’s one of those endings where you’re super anxious to read the next book. So please, Jessica- don’t make us wait too long!

"Nuts by Alice Clayton is a refreshingly fun romantic comedy. Sometimes when I’m reading I’ll think ‘This would make a perfect movie.’ I could easily see this book on the big screen. It was sweet, funny, smart and sassy.Roxie is a chef to the stars in LA. She loves her job, it’s exactly what she wants to be doing. When her mom calls her with a request to run the family’s diner for the summer, Roxie does it, even though it’s the last thing she wants to do. Her first week there, she runs into a man who makes her look twice. Roxie knows there is something special about Leo, but the thing is, she doesn’t do love.Roxie is also not planning on staying in this small New York town forever. Leo is a farmer in her town, and isn’t planning on going anywhere. They have the summer together. When they’re together, sparks fly. Their chemistry is palpable. You can tell when their attraction starts to shift into something more. Something that scares Roxie. Her plan is and has always been to help her mom out, run the diner for the summer, then go back to California. Now things are changing. She’s got all kinds of small town ideas. She sees possibilities. Is this change in her life something she’s willing to risk? Or is going back to California the path she’ll take…Roxie is a character I think most of us can relate to. She struggles with doing what she wants to do with her life and following her dreams. When her dreams become something she least expected, it takes her a minute to embrace that change. Change can be scary, but it can also be a great thing. Leo is a great man. As much as I love both characters separately, together is where they really shine. Leo and Roxie together are a hoot. Clayton always writes the most naturally funny characters. No one is trying too hard, there is no slap stick humor, it’s just all around genuinely funny.Alice Clayton’s writing style is always fun and fantastic. After reading Wallbanger, I had such high expectations I felt as though nothing she's written since really lived up to that book… Until I read Nuts. This is my new favorite book by her. It made me laugh, it made me smile, and just left me in an all around good mood. If you’re looking for a fun book with a feisty heroine, great hero and a charming storyline, pick this one up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZDI4ZQW4385/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118137#wasThisHelpful","RIZDI4ZQW4385","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forever with Me is the book in Armentrout’s ‘Wait for You’ series I was most anxious to read. This is Nick’s book. The bartender we’ve met in the other books, and Stephanie’s. I love that she put this couple together. Both are known for their no-relationships/only one night stands status, so I was curious to see how their story would turn out. It was so much more emotional than I expected. I cried in this book. Real tears, not just tearing up. It may have been that the subject matter was delicate for me, but I seriously had a mini-breakdown on the way to work in my car listening to the audio. It was so very heartbreaking at times.Nick and Steph were so much more than I expected. I was interested to read their story, but I didn’t think that I would love it or them as much as I did. I was especially impressed with Stephanie. She hasn’t been shown in the best light in some of the other books, but she’s one of my favorite heroines of the series. She was fun and feisty, had a take no crap attitude, but she also had a big heart. Nick was also great. Learning about his past and seeing the way he handled his heartbreak made me love him more. I don’t really feel like I can review this story properly. Anything I say about the plot could definitely be spoiler-ish and this is one you want to read without those hints. I think had I known was was going on, it wouldn’t have been as powerful. I love Armentrout’s writing and this series. This book had a little less mystery/drama than the last few but it didn’t need it. It had so many other things going on I think it would have been overkill. I enjoyed this one lots, even if it did make me cry like a baby. I can’t wait for the next book in this series (BROCK!) and I love the way his story has been set up! If you’re looking for an emotional yet sweet and sexy read, this is one you’ll want to pick up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LW1DMT43I31K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YD4GDFA#wasThisHelpful","R3LW1DMT43I31K","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there was one word I could use to describe this story it would be fun. This was a light, laugh out loud read that was an all around good time and hella entertaining to listen to.This is the second book in Rachel Van Dyken’s Consequence series. I haven’t read the first, so it’s obvious they can be read as stand-alones.Our hero of this story, Max, gets put on a reality show similar to the bachelor. His friends think this is a great idea, to get him out of his funk and find a match for him. The problem is, the woman he chooses will get to pick between love or money. Him or the cash. He is okay with this, in fact, he finds a girl straight away that he can tell will be the winner. Becca is not only someone he’s attracted to, she is someone he can see himself being friends with. They develop a friendship during this reality show, but it becomes more than that. They both start to develop feelings along the way and it leaves Becca to make a huge decision. The love or the money? It’s not as easy or predictable as you may think.Max was a fantastically funny hero. He made the book for me. From start to finish there were too many laugh out loud moments from him to count. I liked Becca as well, though not nearly as much as Max. There were also a slue of secondary characters who were great.The hero and the narration easily get 5 stars from me. It was funny (though a little over the top at times) and the story was good. I'd give it a 4 over all and highly recommend LISTENING to this one. The narrator was fantastic. If I read instead of listened, I'm not sure if it would have been as enjoyable for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2THBF4JO37GHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z96S6K6#wasThisHelpful","R2THBF4JO37GHT","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aleatha Romig wrote one of my favorite series (The Consequences series) so even though I had no idea what to expect when starting Betrayal I expected greatness. She delivered. Betrayal is a fantastic start to her Infidelity series (don’t let the title fool you, there is no cheating in this one ;) ).Alex Collins is on a one week vacation from her life. After just graduating college and getting ready to start law school, she needs that break. She and her best friend plan to just hang out and relax for a week. Then she meets Nox. Nox is mysterious, he’s handsome, confident and take charge. He knows what he wants and he wants her. They decide on some rules. One week. No details of real life. And it works. Though after that week, Alex can’t deny that she wants more. Alas, it’s back to the real world for her. Which unfortunately means back to her home for the first time in years.There is a lot that goes on at the Montague Manor. This is where the true betrayal begins. A weaker person than Alex would have been taken down by what happens to her, but let me tell you a little something about Alex. She is strong. She is also determined. She’s willing to do whatever it takes to live her life the way she wants and I love that she doesn’t just give in to what others what her to do. She’s a fighter.Alex’s story jumps from past (just 6 weeks or so) to present. The past is her one week with Nox, her present is the now. Every time I would get into a past chapter, I didn’t want it to end. And every time I would get into a present chapter, I had to know what happened next. Although I did love seeing what was going on in the present, I have to say Alex’s time with Nox was my favorite to read about.The last chapter or so definitely had that jaw dropping moment. And then it ended. I wouldn’t say the cliffhanger was huge, but it has me craving more of this story! I can’t wait to read more about Alex and find out more about Nox.Betrayal is not as dark or suspenseful as some of Romig's other books, but it still has that unique style and of course there were some twists along the way. It was addictive and once I started, I didn’t want to put it down. I absolutely love this woman’s writing and non-conventual stories. I think the direction this story took was fantastic. I’m not sure how I’m going to wait for January for the next installment. A great start to a potentially epic series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IZSRED6E9OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J2HJMY#wasThisHelpful","R29IZSRED6E9OK","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Martian is a book I wouldn’t normally read-  but with the previews for the movie, and my husband reading it and loving it, I thought I’d give it a go. I’m glad I did. It was one of the most entertaining audio books I’ve listened to. There was simply one reason I enjoyed this book so much- and that reason is Mark Watney. He was full of laughs and constantly made me smile. No matter what bad things were going on and how hopeless things seemed, he found a plan and was hilarious in the process. He’s a fantastic character.This story was full of science. I am a nurse- but I am not science smart. I got through most of my science classes with a ton of extra studying and very smart and patient lab partners. So most of the science went right over my head… If it wasn’t for the humor and Mark, I’m not sure if I would have loved it so much. My point is you don’t have to be science smart to enjoy this book!I’m even more excited to see the movie after listening to this. If you’re looking for a smart and funny book, this is one I recommend. And one last thing…. POTATOES.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAVE7Z66EKPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMXBDMA#wasThisHelpful","RQAVE7Z66EKPB","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Summer Remains by Seth King, I knew I had to read anything and everything else he put out. I love his writing, the poetic and beautiful style he has. He’s one of those authors that I highlight the heck out of while reading. This novella is about Autumn and Hank, both of who we meet in Summer Remains.I’m not gonna lie. When I first met Autumn, she got on my nerves. Heck- she got on my nerves some in this book. But I liked her so much more than I thought I would. She’s sarcastic, she’s funny and she’s overly opinionated. She’s a girl who only knows how to be herself. She struggles with thoughts of her future, she doesn’t like looking back to her past because all she can think about is the loss.Then there is Hank. Hank is a character I loved right away. He has been through some tough things. He’s suffered a lot of loss and his life hasn’t been easy, but he’s moving forward. He and Autumn find each other and she needs him more than ever. He accepts Autumn and all her crazy. In fact, he loves her for it. Hank has issues of his own, but he always seems to be able to put them aside and be there for Autumn. Even though these two seemed like an unlikely pair, they were kind of perfect together.I love that this novella packed so much emotion into such a small amount of pages. It made me tear up, but it also made me laugh and smile. I hope we get to read more about Hank and Autumn in the future- I’d really like to see more of their story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AT5NOK7LT1OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515172171#wasThisHelpful","R3AT5NOK7LT1OS","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kim Holden knows how to hit you right in the feels with her stories. Every single time. I really thought I would be okay reading Gus. That there would be no tears… boy was I wrong. My emotions were working overtime while reading this, as were my tear ducts. I will say, however, that by the end, I had such a big smile on my face and my heart was filled with so much happiness, that the tears were more than worth it.Aside from Kate, Gus was my favorite character in Bright Side. Something about this dude just made me smile. He was such a great friend to Kate and an awesome person. But Gus without Kate… he’s just not the same Gus anymore. He doesn’t feel the same. Being on tour isn’t the same. Making music isn’t the same. Nothing is the same.Scout is a girl who comes into Gus’s life just at the right time. They are a very unlikely pair and Scout is standoffish at first. Scout and Gus end up spending a lot of time together. Gus starts to heal, to be more of himself again. Scout see’s that. At first, she wasn’t crazy about the guy. Now she see’s this fun and beautiful person he really is.I really feel like certain people come into you life for a reason. Scout and Gus came into each others life to help heal one another. They both needed each other equally. I loved these two together. I loved that Scout never was jealous about his love for his Bright Side. She and Gus were fantastic.Any talk of Kate… I just couldn’t handle my emotions. She is one of those characters I’ll never forget. Gus was her very best friend and she loved him so much. I’m so glad he got the happy he deserved. I loved seeing all the characters from <i>Bright Side</i> make their appearances throughout this story. And it couldn’t have ended in a more perfect way!Kim Holden writes the most beautiful, emotional and heart-wrenching stories. Her characters are so lovable and even though her books always make me cry, they also make me smile big time. They make me want to live my life to the fullest, to Do Epic every day. And that is why I love these books so much.

"I don’t think I’ve ever loved a hero/heroine duo as much as I love both Lily and Lo. I was equal parts excited and sad to finish the third and final Addicted book. It was a bittersweet moment for me. Yes, I know there are spin offs and we get LiLo there, but it’s not the same. They are one of those couples I can’t get enough of. This was for sure my favorite book of the series so far!It’s been years since Lily and Lo went from childhood best friends, to being in a fake relationship, then to giving it a real go. They have been officially together for years. Everything they do, they do for each other. Their love is undeniable. It’s all consuming and beautiful. It’s strong enough to help them fight their battles. They both know they can do anything, get through anything as long as the other is by their side. Lily gives Lo his strength, and he does the same for her.This book was super emotional for me. I don’t know if it’s because it’s the last Lily and Lo book or what, but there it had me in tears more than once. There was one scene in particular I was listening to while driving to work and I just started bawling like a baby. My heart was filled with such joy I cried. I just feel so connected to these characters I can’t help but get attached.Lily and Lo are my favorite couple, but I love all the other group dynamics as well. Lo and Ryke have the most special relationship to me. They are half brothers but so much more than that. Lo would have never gotten sober without the help of Ryke. Ryke loves his brother so much.  I think Ryke was the first person to truly believe in Lo and support him (aside from Lily) and it made all the difference. I also love Connor and Lo’s friendship. Neither of these guys really  had any close guy friends and they have a banter and bond I love reading about. And of course the 3 sisters. I love them all together.This is a series where I love every single character, every single page of every single book. It is my new favorite series. Lily and Lo have made these books so special for me. Something about this couple makes my heart so happy. I love them so much. I loved the geeky references in this story the most- they made my inner nerd so happy! These books are amazing. I can’t recommend them enough and I honestly can’t believe I put off reading them for so long! Addicted After All was the perfect conclusion to Lily and Lo’s epic romance and I can’t wait to read more about these characters!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24MX8CAEFEYHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2RBHPS#wasThisHelpful","R24MX8CAEFEYHD","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a while since I’ve read  a book thats kept a constant smile on my face. Heart Shaped Hack was just the book I needed! It was so different than the other Tracey Garvis-Graves book I read, but just as good! Maybe even better! It had romance, comedy, and even some suspense. The writing was fantastic and it was all around a wonderful 5 star read for me!Kate gave up her law career to run a non-profit food bank. She wanted to make a difference in the world and this is where she feels like she really can. The thing is, the food bank is struggling. Then she gets this anonymous donation twice in a row that turns things around for them. She finally catches the donor. His name is Ian and he’s a hacker. The way he obtained the donation wasn’t quite legal, and Kate knows this is not good, but there is just something about Ian she can’t help but be drawn to. Ian eventually wears her down after spending some time around her and gets her to agree to date him.I loved Ian and Kate’s relationship. They were the most fun couple. Their back and forth banter made the book for me. Ian is just the type of guy Kate has been looking for. Kate is a heroine I respected. I loved that she followed her dream of doing what she wanted to help the greater good and didn’t just stay at a job for the money. She also didn’t settle for a relationship with someone before Ian because it was easy or convenient. Those are some amazing qualities for a woman to have.With Ian’s job, it’s very rare that he settles down in any particular place. This makes dating/relationships difficult. He only gets serious with a woman when he really feels it. And he feels it with Kate. Their love is a beautiful adventure.As fresh and fun as this story was, there is a moment towards the end that completely stopped my heart. I was in a state of shock for a few minutes, but thankfully things cleared up pretty fast. <i>Heart Shaped-Hack</i> is listed as book #1 but there is absolutely no cliffhanger. This could most definitely be read as a stand alone, but I wouldn’t count on it. I mean, who isn’t going to want MORE Ian and Kate after reading this? Any book that can make me smile and laugh so much deserves 5 stars, especially when the story is strong and the writing is great. If your looking for a feel good, fun read that will keep a smile on your face, this is one I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SUC99PLE61K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCUGPXK#wasThisHelpful","R3SUC99PLE61K","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read every single book of Abbi Glines (Yes- ALL of them) so when I heard she was writing a new YA book, I had to get it asap. She is such a guilty pleasure of mine because I know exactly what to expect when I read a book of hers. I know the type of heroes/heroines to look forward to and usually what direction the book will go. Her books have a formula and it’s one that works for me. Until Friday Night had that, but was a little different since it was YA.Maggie and West meet one Friday night… both are completely different but have more in common than they could ever imagine. Maggie just moved to town and is staying with her aunt, uncle and cousin, Brady. She doesn’t speak. She can, but chooses not to due to a horrific incident in her past. West appears to have it all. He’s a star football player, popular guy and could have any girl he wants. But his home life has changed drastically since his dad got sick. He doesn’t feel like anyone would understand. But Maggie does. She lived through her own hell and found her own way to cope. Now she’s helping West.Even though Maggie is deemed ‘off limits’ early on by her cousin, West still finds a way to be close to her. He needs her friendship. He needs her to be there for him. It’s the only thing holding him together. She is the only thing that’s holding him together. Friendship is all it can ever be with a girl like her though. West knows she deserves better than someone like him.West uses girls to feel numb. He is that typical high school popular jock that can have anyone he wants. But the person he wants is Maggie. Even though he shouldn’t. Even though it’s been forbidden…. and what makes it even more difficult, is that she wants him too.What I liked best about this book was watching the characters grow. Maggie started out as a girl who was so traumatized she wouldn’t speak to anyone. But West needing her helped her heal. And West- he was going through such a hard time, but Maggie changed him. Really, they changed each other for the better.Until Friday Night was a little racey for a YA book, and a little tame for NA. Set in high school, it was kind of in-between IMO. It was a little on the short side and I found myself finishing it in one sitting. I was expecting this one to be light and fun, but it had more of a serious undertone. Still, I enjoyed it. I’m looking forward to more in this series and I’m really hoping the next book is a Nash book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30H219PYNBJF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBKUXQQ#wasThisHelpful","R30H219PYNBJF1","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Addicted series is one of a kind. I love everything about these books. Thrive is almost like reading a book(s) you love from another pov. Usually, I’m not crazy about that. But I desperately needed to know what was going on with Lily and Lo when everything happened in KTS and HHF. Even though most of the plot/storyline was the same, it didn’t feel like the same old same old- LiLo brought so much more to the story. Seeing where Lo’s head was when he did certain things was much needed for me.Thrive takes place directly after Addicted for Now and spans over two years. It’s not as detailed as some of the other books because you already know what’s going on so it doesn't need to be. I’ve heard you can read this series in different ways, but in my opinion you NEED TO READ THEM ALL and you need to read them all in ORDER. I can’t imagine skipping any.I understand the appeal of Raisy and Cobolway, and I love them all- don’t get me wrong, but there is nothing better than LILO. I can’t explain my love for them. They are my new favorite book couple. Their love is so real, all consuming and epic. I love how they always 100% support one another. It doesn’t matter if they make a mistake or whatnot, this couple always has one another’s back. And the references (Harry Potter, XMen etc) are my favorite thing ever! They bring out my inner geek and I love it! There were times that reading from Lo’s pov brought me to tears. These books are really emotional for me because I feel so attached and connected to the characters. Even though I already knew what was going to happen, I still stayed fully invested and the story didn’t feel repetitive. It still felt fresh to me.I’m getting ready to start Addicted After All and I’m equal parts sad and excited. This is the last Lily and Lo book. I don’t want to stop reading about them. I don’t want this series to end! Thankfully, there is another book after that and a few more on the way!

"Worth It is the sixth book in Linda Kage’s Forbidden Men series. I love these books so much. Knox and Felicity are newer characters to the gang, more loosely connected to the others so I wasn’t sure how I would connect with their story. I shouldn’t have worried. Linda brought her ‘A’ game with this one. Knox and Felicity’s story was heart wrenching, beautiful and completely emotional. It went from present to past- from dark to light, from hard to read to easy. This one had a different feel than most of the others in this series, but I loved it.Felicity and Knox meet when they’re in high school. Knox is a little older than her and they come from two different sides of the track. Felicity’s family is rich and well known. Knox’s family is also well known, but for very different reasons. Knox has tons of siblings and his dad’s the equivalent of the town drunk. When these two meet, they know it would be best if they stayed away from each other. Any sort of friendship or relationship would not be accepted between the two of them. But they can’t stay away.Their friendship is strong and it eventually develops into more. What Felicity and Knox have is true, it’s real and it’s a first love either one of them will never forget.This young couple is happy. They’re in love. Embarking on a secret and forbidden romance isn’t easy, but they make it work. At least until Felicity turns 18. But their secret romance doesn’t stay secret forever. Eventually, they get caught. And the consequences are dire.Fast forward six years. It’s been six years since they’ve laid eyes on each other. Felicity has tried to stay strong during that time, but it’s been hard. Now Knox is back in her life, but he’s different. He’s broken. Moving forward may be impossible for this couple, but Felicity won’t give up. She’ll fight for Knox because she knows that no matter how much time has past and no matter how much he’s changed, he is and always has been worth it.Knox and Felicity were two characters I loved reading about. Their past was so sweet and fun. I loved getting those chapters intertwined with the present. The present wasn’t always so pretty, but it was real. This book kept me up till the wee hours of the night reading. Once I started it, I had to know what was going to happen with these two and how they got to this place.The relationship this couple had was beautiful. I love reading about true and genuine love stories like this.  Linda Kage writes the best characters and stories. I find myself constantly falling in love with her books. One of the best parts about this book was seeing so much of the other characters we know and love. And Asher… after that teaser at the end of this book I’m even more excited to read his story! Felicity and Knox’s story isn’t one you’ll read and quickly move on from. It’s one you’ll devour and one that will stay with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13Z0PL4BC7E1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EI55FA#wasThisHelpful","R13Z0PL4BC7E1N","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love stories about first loves. I love stories that go from past to present. And we all know I love Renee Carlino’s writing. I read Sweet Thing when it first came out and have been a huge fan ever since. This book had so many elements that I loved … and one huge thing that really irked me, but even with the issue I had, it was still a beautiful, emotional and captivating read that I would recommend.Grace and Matt’s story spans 15+ years. I would say close to half the book is written from the past, and the other half, the present. I’m not going to lie- I loved the past chapters. Watching Matt and Grace fall in love, seeing their younger, free spirit and artistic selves made my heart happy. All the past scenes were fantastic. Matt and Grace became ‘fast friends’ their senior year at college. Matt is a photography major, and Grace majors in music where she plays the cello. Their fast friendship quickly turns into more. Their breakfast for dinner, impromptu photoshoots, concerts, and all around fun times show a happy and completely in love couple.When it comes time for graduation, things become difficult. Matt has a once in a lifetime opportunity to intern with National Geographic for the summer. And be away from Grace for months. And Grace has an opportunity to travel with an orchestra for a year and a half. Their lives are going in different directions, but both are determined to stay together.Fast forward 15 years….There were things I loved about the present as well. Aside from the miscommunication, it was great to see Grace and Matt reconnect again. They are both endearing characters. I love how they both never had anything like their first love. Their love for each other. It’s a romantic concept. Falling fast and hard and never truly moving on from the first love, the love of your life. Throughout the book, I rooted for these two. I desperately wanted them to have their happy ending.If you’re looking for a fantastic first love story, a second chance romance story, a friends to lovers story, or a beautifully emotional story- Before We Were Strangers is the book for you. Renee Carlino’s writing and character development is wonderful. The end left me with a happy heart and a smile on my face.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FRL2PA5X2VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65X7MI#wasThisHelpful","R30FRL2PA5X2VK","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I seriously cannot stop reading/listening to these books. In less than a week, I’ve listened to 1, 1.5, and 2 (which is over 40 hours of audio) I’m not reading much at all because I am incapable of pushing pause on this all-consuming series! Now I keep telling myself to slow down because what will I listen to next when this series is over?!? I am loving these books so much, and this is my favorite of the series so far. It still focuses on my favorite couple, Lily and Lo, but we also get more of the other couples. There is love, laughter, healing, and even a little suspense! Someone has told the world about Lily Calloway’s sex addiction. This destroys Lily. Lo is newly sober, but is determined to be there for Lily no matter what. He is her rock. She needs him to help with her addiction and to be there to love and support her, and he does 100%.The couple is on spring break vacation with the rest of the gang for a good part of the book. It brings new challenges for Lily and Lo and gives you more time with the other characters as well. The best part about this one… dual pov! That’s right my friends- we get Lily AND Lo’s perspective. It was great being in both of their heads and I think it added so much more to the story.Lily and Lo are two characters I love so much. Everyone talks about how much they love Connor and Ryke in these books, and they’re great, but for me, Lo is the favorite. I love how much he loves Lily. How understanding he is, how he never judges her. He just loves her. He sees her more than a sex addict. She is worth everything to him.It makes me so happy to see this couple overcome some of their obstacles. They are characters you will root for. The writing in these books are flawless. I am enjoying this series so much. Addicted for Now gets a full 5 stars from me. I can’t wait to get into the next one, which is the first spin off and features Connor and Rose. Even though Rose isn’t my favorite character, I have a feeling it won’t disappoint!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVY025YFZUIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H06NGBM#wasThisHelpful","RGVY025YFZUIC","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That Boy and That Baby are two books that I’ve read, re-read and re-read again. To say that I was anxiously awaiting That Baby to release would be an understatement. The wait was long, and as soon as this book became I available I dropped what I was doing and picked it up! Phillip and Jadyn are one of my favorite couples and Danny Diamond is one of the best fictional characters ever! I loved seeing this trio back and together. They’ve been through a lot- childhood, high school, tragedies, college, engagements, weddings and now… pregnancies. They can get through anything, as long as they have each other. Phillip and JJ are newly weds. The last thing they are expecting is a baby to come along… but life is full of the unexpected. Now that Baby Mac is on the way, life is changing. JJ and Phillip are the best couple. They are so fun and sweet and Phillip is the best husband to JJ. He truly is her prince. I love hearing them banter about the pregnancy and baby to be. Jillian always puts so much humor in her stories, no matter how serious some of the topics may be and I love that about her books.Overall, the final book in the That Boy series was worth the wait. It had the perfect amount of sweet, swoon, humor and emotion that made it such a fantastic read. Jillian’s writing always makes me smile. I love these characters so much- this trio of Jaydn, Phillip and Danny will always hold a special place in my heart!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UL0TOUXN3GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J6PLJ8#wasThisHelpful","R11UL0TOUXN3GP","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The minute after I started Addicted to You I started listening to Ricochet. Safe to say I am becoming addicted to this series!This companion novel starts off right after book one leaves off, and it lasts 90 days. 90 days where Lo is in rehab staying sober and 90 days where Lily must live in the real world staying celibate. Both are getting the help they need and fighting their addictions. Even though they’re not together physically, they’re still together fighting their addictions and trying to stay strong for each other.This, like the first book, is entirely from Lily’s pov. I really wanted more Lo in this one, like maybe some of his time away, that’s the only reason it wasn’t quite a 5 for me. I still loved it lots. It was great to get a little more time  with Ryke and Daisy- I can tell their book is going to be fun!I listened to this book, and the narration was fantastic. I think the woman who voices Lily does a fantastic job capturing her. Now on to listen to the next one and get my next fix of Lily and (hopefully more) Lo!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5A5TNOEPZSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9BE7TQ#wasThisHelpful","R1L5A5TNOEPZSV","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jordie’s book is one I’ve been waiting for. Assassin’s hockey player, bearded and tattooed, vulgar, life of the party and Karson King’s best friend. Those are the things we knew about Jordie. In Overtime, you learn so much more. Toni shows a side of him I didn’t know existed. Even though Jordie has a lot growth in this book, he doesn’t lose who he is.After an injury thats keeping him from the rink, Jordie spirals out of control. There’s no other way to put it. He’s a mess. He’s terrified of not being able to play again. And he’s not coping well. Hockey is his life. What would happen if he couldn’t play? What would he do? Who would he be?Kacey King is also a hockey player. She has reached her goal of winning the gold in the Olympics. She’s made it. She should feel like she has it all, right? Career wise, maybe she does. But there is a big hole in her heart left by none other than Jordie Thomas. Jordie is her brothers best friend and a guy she completely fell in love with. They did not end on a good note. Jordie hurt her and she’s struggling to move past him. How do you move on from someone you love?Kacey is one of those heroines I love. A woman who speaks her mind, has goals and ambition, loves her friends and family and takes no crap. She’s great. In fact, the entire King family is great. I love them all, especially their dad. Kacey is a lot like him.After going through strenuous therapy on his knee and getting his head together, Jordie is finally back to normal. In fact, he may be better than he’s ever been. For the first time in a long time, his life is on track. He has goals and he’s trying to step up and be a better man.It was time to be the man he wanted to be. It was time to live the life he wanted. And maybe, just maybe, he could get the love he wanted too. Now that he’s got himself together, he wants his girl. He knows he’s made too many mistakes to count. He knows he doesn’t and will never deserve the love of Kacey King, but he’s gotta try. He loves her and he makes it his mission to win her back.Kacey and Jordie do not have a easy relationship. Once trust (and hearts) have been broken, it can be hard to move forward. But Jordie is nothing but persistent. And as stubborn as Kacey is, she has always loved Jordie Thomas and she’s beginning to think she always will…What a beautiful and healing story. Jordie’s story was nothing like I expected it to be. I thought it would be all laughs and fun, but the subject matter was actually more serious than most of the Assassin’s books. I loved the risk Toni took in this story. And I did enjoy the direction it took. It had so much heart, emotion, but it still had the humor and steam I love from this series.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I am not a hockey fan. I am not a sports fan. But there is something about the way Toni Aleo writes her hockey books that makes me want to be. She is by far my favorite sports romance author. This series is something special. These characters are more than friends and colleagues. They are family. Jordie and Kacey’s story was a fantastic addition to the Assassin’s series and I can’t wait to read more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6B0JE1L5B51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111EOXRO#wasThisHelpful","R6B0JE1L5B51","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tillie Cole is one of those authors I can always count on to make me feel when I read. She does an amazing job of writing tortured characters with emotional and beautiful stories. Souls Unfractured may be her most emotional book yet. Although I knew it would be. After hearing about the things Maddie (Mae’s sister) went through in the previous books, I knew her story would get to me. Pair that with Flame, who’s past may have been even more horrid and you’ll have a book that will keep your heart hurting, but in true Tillie fashion, it will be healed by the end of the book.Flame is one of those characters who I had to know about after reading the first two Hades Hangman books. He’s different than the rest of the Hangmen. He’s a little more violent, a little more quiet and there is something different about him… he can’t be touched by anyone. Not women, not his brothers that he trusts. He can’t cope with that.He and Maddie have that in common. Maddie grew up in the same religious cult as Mae and Lilah. The man who had her was extra violent and terrible and has scarred Maddie. Men make her nervous, even good men. All men. All men, except for Flame. He saved her and she isn’t afraid of him. She dreams about being with Flame, about touching him. Even the most simple thing, like holding hands would mean the world to her. And this is not one sided. Flame wants more than anything to be able to touch Maddie. To be there for her when he needs her, to be able to hold her, but he’s not sure it’s possible. He cares too much for her to ever hurt her the way he feels he will if she gets too close. Maddie and Flame are characters who grow together, who go through so much together, and who heal together. Watching their story unfold was such a beautiful and emotional experience.  I loved these two broken characters so much. I rooted for them. I was proud of them when they overcame things that were hard for them. Their story was not easy to read. Especially Flame’s. I could tell pretty much straight away why he was the way he was and knowing how he was treated growing up made me sick to my stomach. It’s not an easy read. But by the end, it’s so worth it. Maddie and Flame’s love story is worth all the heartache.Maddie and Flame are characters that touched my heart and ones I won’t ever forget. Not only did we get to know so much more about them, but we also got more Ky and Lilah, Styx and Mae and getting to know AK and Viking makes me want their books next! I love the friendship and brotherhood they had with Flame. And call me crazy, but I’m dying to know whats going to happen with Cain as the series continues…Souls Unfractured is another fantastic addition to the Hades Hangman series. These books are so much more than just biker books. They are stories of overcoming adversity, healing old wounds, moving on from the past and letting love conquer all. Tillie Cole is a favorite author of mine and books like thing just solidify that. Full of a beautiful intensity, her words move you, make you feel, break you apart, then heal that broken heart. This was a real win for me and I’m looking forward to reading the next book in this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWKDXTNB48P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OJYRJI#wasThisHelpful","R3PWKDXTNB48P8","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Addicted to You is a story that is just that- addictive. I can’t imagine finishing this book and not needing to dive right into the next. I can’t believe that I’ve waited this long to read this series, but I’m kind of glad I did.  I can binge read them all now.Lily and Lo are childhood friends and a couple as far as everyone knows. In reality, they’re both addicts. Lo is an alcoholic and Lily is a sex addict. They both come from rich, affluential families and if their families ever found out, it would be bad. So they pretend. They pretend to be a couple, pretend to be together to take the heat off one another. In reality, they are best friends and enablers for each others addictions. They are always there for each other and always have each other’s backs. Even if their relationship isn’t the healthiest, you can tell their friendship is real and so it the love between them.After carrying on this charade for years, something happens between this couple. They both come to realize their feelings are stronger than just friendship. They love each other as more than friends. Even with their addictions, they want to try. Try to turn what first started as a facade into something real. Become a real couple. Maybe Lo can drink less and maybe Lily can control her addiction to being only with Lo. Just maybe they can do this together…Both of these characters are destructive, damaged and flawed. And I loved them both. Lo is such a fantastic guy- he had so many issues of his own but he loves Lily fiercely and wants her to be his. I adored him. I also loved all of the secondary characters- Ryke, Connor, even Rose by the end. I can’t wait to read more about them and I’m happy to know they’ll be getting their own books!This story had such a unique plot. I loved that even though both of the main characters fed their addictions, they really did care about one another and honestly cared more about helping the others than helping themselves. By the end they learned sometimes you have to help yourself first before you can help the person you love. I have a feeling in <i>Ricochet</i> they will both face many challenges but I hope that their love will endure and pull them through battling their demons. The writing style was perfect- I couldn’t believe that this was written by two people, it had such a great flow. Addicted to You is the start of an intense, emotional, edgy and addictive series that you won’t want to miss out on!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HGT8LC77TAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DE5EBZ8#wasThisHelpful","R31HGT8LC77TAS","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bad Intentions is a story about finding yourself. About taking risks, taking chances and being bold. It’s about a girl who felt like she lost everything in life going her own way and finding out there is more out there left to dream and there’s a whole different world right in front of her.Adaley Knight was on the fast track to be an Olympic gymnast. It’s all she’s ever wanted, all that she’s worked for. When that dream is pulled out from underneath her, she moves cross country for college leaving behind everything and everyone she’s ever known. When she gets there, she quickly bonds with her fun and quirky roommate, Zoe and Zoe’s brother Tank. Zoe and Tank were quite frankly my favorite characters. Especially Tank. I adored him! I’m looking forward to reading his story :)Back to Adaley- she is trying to find herself and making choices that aren’t really her along the way. When she meets Ryle Benson, she is immediately attracted to him. Then he opens his mouth. And he’s a huge jerk. But the more she gets to learn about Ryle, the more she sees him. Really sees him. His past, the reasons he is the way he is, that his heart is actually really big. Both of these characters have a past that they’re not very open about, and when things come to light, it’s not always pretty.Bad Intentions is a book I had trouble rating. Because there were many good points- I love the authors writing, I loved the secondary characters lots, and even Ryle grew on me after a while. But I also had issues with the direction the story took. Not just the ending, which was a shocker, but the events leading up to the end. It really rubbed me the wrong way. The heroine made some choices that I ultimately couldn’t forget about and it changed my feelings for her. I adore Nacole and her writing style, and very much look forward to reading Tank’s story. Adaley and Ryle’s story had some good moments, but overall didn't work for me. Still- if you’re looking for a shocking, heart wrenching story that is high on angst and has some humor as well, it may just be the book for you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QB5S9U5XO2WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HDXKAI#wasThisHelpful","R3QB5S9U5XO2WX","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Sweet Addiction about 6 months ago and I have no idea why it took me so long to get to the sequel! I love Dylan and Reese and the continuation of their story.Dylan and Reese are together, happy and planning a wedding. It’s an exciting time for all- even though Dylan and Reese could care less about the actual wedding; they’re just ready to be married to one another. I love their relationship. It’s sweet, fun and steamy. They are great together. Reese is the perfect combination of protective, sweet, kind and lovable. Dylan is always LOL funny. She’s a great friend and loves Reese with everything she is. I can’t write a review for this book and not mention my favorite character of the bunch- Joey. He really is the best! I would LOVE a Joey and Billy book or novella. That would be great!I listened to the audio version of this book. The narrator did a nice job capturing Dylan’s spunk and personality. J.

"Labeled Love is Danielle Rocco’s debut novel, but you’d never know it by reading this story. The writing style is fantastic and the words are beautiful. This is one of those books that I devoured and one that kept a permanent smile on my face. It’s one of the sweetest books ever. This couple has so much love and devotion for one another, you will easily fall in love with Jace, Shay and their story. It’s a book that needs to be read!Jace is a boy who lives on the wrong side of the tracks. He’s being raised by a single mother who could care less about him. Essentially, he’s alone in this world. That is until this thirteen year old boy meets Shay Stark, and his life is forever changed.Shay Stark is the daughter of a successful music producer in LA. She is a good kid and a bit of a tomboy. Her family has money, but she has wonderful parents who have taught her that it’s not everything. After going to a community center across town with her mom, she decides to join a game of football with the boys. There she sees him. Jace. A boy with dark hair, light eyes and too small clothes. Jace makes her feel something she’s never felt. Jace and Shay spend the next few years meeting at the community center once a week. They’re best friends and fall into a true, real love along the way. Wednesdays are the best day of the week and the only day Jace really has to look forward to. Shay makes Jace want to be better. He only cares about keeping her happy, about being with her. She is the one true thing in his life. The one real thing. The one good thing. And he will always belong to her.Shay and Jace’s relationship was the most beautiful thing. They share peanut butter jelly sandwiches, he writes her love letters, she writes him songs, they always have each other no matter what. Falling in love young isn’t always an easy path, especially when it’s real and forever love. This couple doesn’t always have it easy. They have more obstacles than your average couple. But they also have enough love to conquer them all.I was so impressed with this book. The writing, the characters, the story… just all of it. I can’t think of anything I didn’t love. Shay and Jace were such special characters. I completely adored them. I couldn’t get enough.  It was the sweetest story, but as it went on and the couple got older, it did go borderline NA which I liked. Towards the end, there was some angst that has me anxious for the next book. I can’t wait to see where Jace and Shay’s story goes.Stories about young love make me happy. Shay and Jace’s love isn’t just young puppy love, it’s strong, it has struggles, and it transcends it all. It’s an epic and forever love story about a pretty girl and her boy. Labeled Love really came out of nowhere for me. It was a random book by an author I’d never heard of, but I’m so happy I read it. I will definitely be reading more by this author. Her writing is gorgeous and her story is heartfelt and moving. For anyone who loves YA/young love or is looking for a beautiful love story,  I encourage you to pick this one up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWPWTDBQ04PFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EVOSAO#wasThisHelpful","RWPWTDBQ04PFA","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 fire truck stars!!!I’m convinced that Jay McLean is magic. Her ‘More Than’ series is one of my favorite series ever. It’s not very often a book will effect me like those books did. I love all her work, but nothing of hers has got to me like the More books. Until now. Kick Push is equally as good when it comes to the story and the feels, but the writing is even better. How can she do that more than once? Put out books like this that just consume and overtake me? I don’t know but I’m glad she does. Fans of this author will not be disappointed and if you haven’t read anything by this author, I can’t recommend her enough! When I read Where the Road Takes Me Josh was by far my favorite character. He was so endearing and lovable and I wanted to know more about him…Josh is a single dad. After getting his girlfriend pregnant at 17, Josh promises his girl he will be there 100%. That they will do it together. Shortly after giving birth to Tommy, she decides it’s too much and abandons Tommy leaving Josh to take care of him alone. Josh has no one. He has nothing. But he’s determined to take care of his son no matter what. He will do anything and sacrifice anything for Tommy.With some help from a older woman who becomes his family, and the support he has from his best friend, Hunter, and later his Uncle and Aunt, Josh is able to make it work. He’ll never have his life and dreams back, not like they were before, but that’s okay. Tommy is more important than anything else in his life.The years pass, and now Tommy is 3. Life is good for Josh. He has a good job and his son. He’s in a far better place than he was. Then it happens. Josh meets someone for the first time in years who makes him reevaluate his life. Someone who falls in love with his son. A girl he starts to fall for. A quiet girl with emerald eyes who completely consumes him.Her name is Becca. Becca’s life hasn’t been easy. She’s had very different struggles than Josh. Meeting Josh and Tommy change her. Becca’s story is one I won’t be talking about at all in my review. It’s one you need to read for yourself, butI will say it broke my heart. Becca is a character that took me a while to warm up to, but after seeing how much she loved Tommy and supported Josh, she grew on me. I loved the dynamic between the three. I can imagine as a single parent there is something so special about someone coming into your life that not only cares for you, but loves your child deeply. For the first time in maybe her entire life, Becca feels wanted, loved and safe. Josh gives her that.As much as I enjoyed reading about Josh and Becca, Josh and Tommy stole the show. Seriously Josh and Tommy together was the best thing ever. Any scene with those two and I completely melted.This book is about falling in love. About second chances. About stepping up. About parenting It’s about friendship, skateboarding, sand pits and photography. About love and forgiveness. It’s about following your dreams. I loved every single chapter, every single page, every single word of this story. Honestly, I wouldn’t change a thing. I fell in complete book love with Kick Push. I want more. More Josh and Becca and definitely more Tommy. I loved the characters, the angst, the emotions, the love, and all the feels. There is so much to this story. So many elements, relationships and it’s just everything. Read it, devour it, and love it! Kick Push is an unforgettable read that’s going straight to the top of my favorite list for 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJHQ3NNXTYOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ARRX2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1UJHQ3NNXTYOU","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsI am a big fan of M. Leighton’s work. I love that she can write sweet and steamy romances, but she also takes risks and writes books that have a bit more of an edge. Strong Enough is one of those books. It focuses on Muse. A girl who starts out by hiring who she thinks is just a bounty hunter to find her father. She quickly learns that Jasper King is so much more than that. Jasper King has a job to do and it’s not just to find Muse’s father. Jasper is involved in something much deeper than that and he has to find answers. He needs Muse to get to the man who can give him his answers, and she needs him to find her father. It’s a win win for both. What neither expected was to have feelings for the other…Muse falls for Jasper quick. She has strong and intense feelings for him that don’t go away, no matter what different sides of him she sees. Jasper feels for her as well, even though he knows he shouldn’t. He knows there is no way this can possibly end well.Muse and Jasper’s story was interesting, it was original, steamy, and well written. There were elements of this book that I very much enjoyed. I thought their love moved too quickly and I found that personally I had trouble connecting to either character. Also, I wanted more for their ending. Overall, I still did like this book- I just wish I would have connected more to the characters and their story. I am looking forward to reading the next book, which will be about Jasper’s friend, Rogan.   This is one I recommend for anyone looking for a steamy and original read with some mystery!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJ2NEXMUD1LI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4FUI#wasThisHelpful","R1NJ2NEXMUD1LI","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, that was quite a ride. Have you ever read a book where so much was going on your head was just spinning when you finished? Thats kind of how I feel right now. There was so much going on in this book, so many characters, storylines and drama drama drama! And I loved it! I loved that Ward could write a book like this and have everything come together so perfectly. Honestly, even with everything happening, I had no trouble keeping track of the characters or story line so that is a huge plus. I was consumed when listening to the story.This book focuses on the Baldwine family. Including Lane, Edward and Gin. Along with their father William and brother Max who isn’t talked about much. Lane and Lizzie are who I would call the main characters of The Bourbon Kings.  Lane and Lizzy have a complicated past. It’s been two years since they’ve seen each other. Two years since Lane has seen anyone in his family. Now he’s home. He’s determined to get things together and fix things with Lizzy, if she’ll have him. Lane was by far my favorite character of the bunch, with Edward being a close second. I can’t wait to read the next in this series. I’m interested to see if it will focus on Edward or Gin. Either way, I hope we get more Lane and Lizzy. I don’t see their story as over.J.R. Ward is one of those authors that can do no wrong. Whether it’s writing my favorite paranormal series thats full of action and emotion, or writing a story about a wealthy Kentucky family that’s full of drama and secrets and twists and turns, she masters it all. This is a total win for me. I was addicted to this book and couldn't stop listening! The only issue I had with the story is that there was so much going on, it didn’t really focus on the main couple like I would have wished. Also, I wonder if when the next book comes out I’ll have trouble remembering everything because SO MUCH happened! Overall, it was still a fantastic read and one I would highly recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIFLN5OJB3WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01013PVTA#wasThisHelpful","RPIFLN5OJB3WV","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beloved is the story of Catherine Pope and Jackson Cole. If you’re like me and have read Corinne's Consolation Duet first, you’ve already met them and know a little about them. I've been anxious to read it and get to know more about these characters since I finished and I'm glad I finally made the time!Catherine Pope has had terrible luck with men. It started with her father, and then her ex. She’s not looking to let anyone else in to just leave her. Then she meets Jackson Cole. Jackson was a Navy SEAL. He’s now running a successful business. Catherine isn't the only one with issues, Jackson has a past of his own (which I can’t wait to find out more about!). Even with all that, from the very start Jackson and Catherine have chemistry. From the moment they first meet, they are drawn to each other. As much as Catherine doesn’t want to risk getting hurt again, Jackson is irresistible to her. Catherine didn't have to fight very hard to fall for a man like Jackson Cole.I adored Jackson and Catherine. They were both fantastic characters. Corinne’s writing has a great flow to it. I enjoyed this book lots and that ending… Gah! I’m going to have to read the next book soon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OKVC7DWUXNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMDDDMM#wasThisHelpful","R1OKVC7DWUXNG","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Summer Remains is a powerful read. It’s not only a book that made me feel, it’s a book that made me think, made me reevaluate the way I see people, treat people and I’ll be honest- not many books have that effect on me. For that reason alone, I would give this book 5 stars. Add in the fact that the writing had a great flow, it was sad and uplifting at the same time, and was just an all around profound and beautiful read makes me want to give it more than 5.   Summer Johnson is one of the most perfect heroines. I liked everything about her. She’s 24 and has been living with a life threatening condition  her entire life. She has a feeding tube, she has scars, but she doesn’t let that dictate who she is and what she wants. She wants love. She wants someone to see her for her. She wants one perfect summer to be herself and find that one person who will love her and accept her for who she is. Then she meets Cooper. The boy who she thinks will change her life forever. Well, the thing is- she’s the one who changes him.Cooper is the opposite of Summer. He appears to be perfect on the outside, and physically he is. But on the inside, he’s scarred. Cooper and Summer develop a beautiful friendship that turns into so much more. I loved watching their relationship grow. This book is one I can say with absolute certainty I will never forget. There were lots of tears, but it also left me with a sense of peace. Cooper and Summer’s love story is one you don’t want to miss out on! And I can’t wait to read the novella that was recently released- I had a bit of a soft spot for Hank :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ANYUTBKZ97Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3W3OFK#wasThisHelpful","R31ANYUTBKZ97Z","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Truth or Beard  has easily made it’s way to my top favorites of 2015. It’s one of those books that really had it all. It’s smart, witty, sweet, original, sexy, fun and the writing is fantastic. The characters are so lovable and great. Really, I couldn’t have asked for more in a book. As soon as I finished reading, I was craving more from this series! I can’t wait to read about the other Winston brothers.This is the story of Jess and Duane. Duane has an identical twin brother named Beau. Beau has always been the nice twin, the twin people like. The twin Jess has crushed on most of her life. But as much as Duane and she have butt heads, he’s always carried a torch for her. I truly loved the relationship between Jess and Duane. They started as that couple that could hardly stand each other and then it clicked. Things changed. They couldn’t stay away from each other. These are really my favorite type of reads. They bicker and can’t stand each other, then realize they are perfect for one another. Seriously. SO great!Everything seems so perfect for the two of them, but there are a few other factors that make things in their relationship interesting. Like the fact that Jess has big plans to travel the world and Duane is settled and happy in small town Tennessee. Add in some drama with the local MC club, and you’ll see a relationship that isn’t easy. Their love isn’t easy, but it is a love worth fighting for.Not only were Duane and Jess fantastic characters, but I loved Duane’s brothers as well. Especially Cletus. He was a hoot. I can’t wait to get more of this group!  Overall, I fell in love with Truth or Beard. It’s probably the best book I’ve read all summer and for sure is one of the best books I’ve read this year. Penny’s writing is clever and consistently good. I was enamored with this story and these characters. This is one of those books I think all readers would enjoy and I’d highly recommend to all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJO5GNUMROM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIHMD2K#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJO5GNUMROM4","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loving the White Liar is not your typical romance. It’s a story of a girl who’s looking for love and a man who never thought he would truly find it.Hilary is ready to start her life, she’s ready for a change. A new job, a real relationship, and she’s on the right path to get there. She put her two weeks notice in at a dead end job and she’s ready to make a change. She meets a new and handsome neighbor named Jayden. Jayden seems too good to be true at first, but the more she gets to know him, she realizes he’s a little different. Jayden has ADHD. He’s open about it, and there are times she doesn’t notice, that it’s no big deal. Then there are times that it’s a very big deal. But Hilary can’t help but fall hard for Jayden. She loves him so much, and he loves her equally. Even when he’s not easy to deal with, she knows he’s worth it.Hilary loved Jayden completely. She saw past his disorder, past all of his flaws and saw him. She fell in love with this damaged man and knew she couldn't live without him. She wasn’t perfect when it came to him, but she tried to be patient, loving and understanding and I loved her for it. I don’t want you to read this review and see Jayden just as this damaged man with this disorder he’s trying to manage. It’s a big part of who he is, but it isn’t all that he is. He’s a truly great man. He loves Hilary so much and whenever he has an episode, he always tries to make amends for what he’s done. He is a fantastic leading man. I love that this story showed that people aren’t perfect. Relationships aren’t perfect. You’re allowed to feel how you feel. But when you truly love some one, you accept them and love them and all the bad times are still worth it in the end.I love that Kate Stewart writes out of the box romance. It's easy to write a traditional love story with a happy ever after, but a real and raw story with imperfect characters and issues all round can't be simple. What’s important is that this book shows that love isn't always easy. Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes it's messy. Sometimes it's a fight, and that's okay. As long as you're willing to fight. And both of these characters were. I love this author’s writing style. And the ending was amazing! I truly loved this story and it’s one I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0APJJTXTZDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122AK9OM#wasThisHelpful","R1D0APJJTXTZDI","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seen mixed reviews on When You’re Back, but it’s book 12 in the Rosemary Beach series and I’ve read the other 11 so I figured why stop now? I’m no quitter and I wanted to see for myself if the book was enjoyable or a dud. For me, it was a good one. I’m not sure if I liked it quite as much as the first, but it was still a fun read with several twists (one I really liked).When You’re Back takes place in Mase’s ranch in Texas, not Rosemary Beach. Mase has to get back to his work and Reese can’t be without him so she moves to the ranch. She decides while she’s in Texas, she needs to get a job. To be strong and independent. But she’s not letting her issues get the best of her, she’s going to try to put herself out there and do something she never thought she could do. Get a job that requires reading, writing etc.I love Reese and Mase together. They are both fantastic characters. You can just feel how much they love each other and what they mean to one another.“I can swear to you that you will always be it for me. No one fits me like you. No one makes me feel whole. No one else ever will.”Several new characters were brought in- one I loved, Blaire’s brother, Captain - I feel like Captain was maybe the best part of the book! I’m happy we’ll be getting his book in just a few months! And then there is a character almost as unlikable as Nan! Mase’s awful cousin Aida. It was always good to see Major and I have my theories about him…Rosemary Beach series is one of those series that have been hit or miss for me, but honesty- more of them have been a hit then a miss so I’m going to keep on reading!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEIWGJZDQT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWSMI3Y#wasThisHelpful","RUEIWGJZDQT7","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read Nine Minutes at the end of last year I remember being completely blown away. I was really excited to read the sequel but also extremely nervous. I was nervous that the book wouldn’t live up to my expectations. The first book was so great, they were very high. But it did. 100% lived up to all my expectations. Maybe even exceeded them.Reading Out of Time was an experience. I cried, I felt, my heart raced and I chewed off every one of my nails. This book jacked me up. It blew my mind. I am still thinking about it, calculating what will happen next in my head. The hours I read I was completely and utterly immersed in these characters story. It’s been two days since I’ve finished this book. Two days and I still find my mind drifting to this story…The story was told in the present (2000) with various flashbacks to the past. We get Grizz’s childhood, Grunt’s childhood, Ginny’s childhood and all the times the three of them were together. It’s written in a way that’s easy to follow. Secrets are revealed. Some are kept. It’s a story of hope, love, lies, betrayal, soul mates and family.Kit is one of those fantastic heroines. I love her and admire her strength. This book showcased just how strong she really is. Grizz is and will always be my favorite character of this series. He’s just one of those characters you can’t help but root for. Now to Grunt- when I finished Nine Minutes, I was not a Grunt fan. However, he really grew on me in this book. I don't know if it was getting a look into his past or finding out what really did or didn’t go down, but still. I’ll admit I did like him a bit. But this girl is still 100% #TeamGrizz.I really don’t want to say anything else about the story. It’s one you need to read for yourself, experience for yourself. If Out of Time shows you anything, it’s that Beth Flynn is not a one hit wonder. This book was equally as epic as the first. Her stories are brilliant and everything is woven together perfectly. There were so many things that were revealed in this story, but there are still so may questions I have. Yes, it ends in a cliffhanger but I knew that going into it. That last chapter… last page… last line. Gah! I’m dying to see what direction she takes in the third and final chapter of the Nine Minutes trilogy. This is one I highly recommend and it’s going straight towards the top of my 2015 favorites list! ","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROI62WRCLG9A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BQ0CYE#wasThisHelpful","ROI62WRCLG9A0","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Revived is book 2 in the Revved series, but can be read as a standalone. In Revved, we meet Brazilian Formula One driver, Leandro Silva. Leandro is slick, he’s talented, and he’s on the top of his game. Until one terrible accident changes everything for him. He’s healing physically, but his mind isn’t in the right place. He’s having trouble coping with his near death experience. He’s having trouble coping with the fact that he’s not a racer anymore, and he can’t be again. Not until he gets himself together.Here enters India Harris. Thirty year old therapist and single mom. Dr. India Harris is just who Leandro needs to get through his issues. She has a way of talking with him and working with him that gets him to make big changes and face his feelings and what he’s going through. One big problem. Leandro starts to fall for India. India has feelings for him as well, which is not only unethical for her, but could also cost her the license she worked so hard for and her career.India and Leandro are in a hard place. Taking a chance on love could have huge repercussions. But is it worth it? Is giving love a chance worth giving up everything else?Leandro was a fun character to read about. I liked him in the first book, but this book he truly won me over. Seeing all the changes he made, the growth that he was able to show was wonderful. India was also a fantastic character. I understood her struggle, the way she had to put her job/career first. It wasn’t just about India. India has a son that factors in so I never faulted her for the times she pushed Leandro away. There was minimal angst in this one (compared to the first LOL) and some drama, but not over the top.Revived is a great addition to this series. I love the way Samantha Towle tells a story. The way that humor, love, friendship and steam are all mixed together perfectly. A highly entertaining, quick read that left me smiling!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP9FNQNCK0YH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EWJA3A#wasThisHelpful","RP9FNQNCK0YH0","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Manwhore +1 is the highly anticipated sequel to Manwhore. After the cliffhanger in book one, I was excited to get my hands on this one. I enjoyed this story and I’m looking forward to the next book (Ms. Manwhore) but I will say I was happy where this book ended. There was no cliffhanger like the first!Rachel Livingston has it bad for Malcolm Saint. After spending her time getting to know him for her article/exposé she was writing, she did the unthinkable. She fell for him.The problem is this couple hasn’t spoken. Saint felt betrayed by Rachel I’m sure, and even with her article where she laid herself bare, she hasn’t heard from him. It’s hurting her heart, but she understands. Then, she gets drawn back in. Back into Malcolm Saint’s vortex. All those feelings of love, attraction, want and need come back at full force.I enjoyed this one. I like both Saint and Rachel’s characters. Rachel is strong and independent, and Malcolm Saint is just a force to be reckoned with. I was happy to get more of them both. I did like that Rachel fought for Malcolm but also stood up to him when it came to her work. I love a strong heroine and a swoony hero!  For some reason, I liked the first book in this series a bit more. It had more of a build up, a little more angst and such. This one was sweet, romantic and steamy. Which is never a bad combination, I just wanted a little more. I love Katy Evan’s writing. Her stories are consistently good and I’m looking forward to reading more in this series. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35H1OQU4TKJGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWUS0JI#wasThisHelpful","R35H1OQU4TKJGV","AX7QPL1UI24F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7QPL1UI24F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Turbo Kid is one part nostalgic love letter, one part creative ingenuity. If you grew up in the 80's or early 90's watching the classic sci-fi action films of the day there will be a lot for you to appreciate about Turbo Kid. The trio of filmmakers that wrote and directed this together really nailed the retro-ism that this movie took on while allowing itself to be comedic at times when necessary.There are some great one liners in the film (like many of the action movies of those decades) as well as some wildly violent and extremely entertaining scenes. The movie takes place in a Mad Max-esque post apocalyptic future of 1997 (presumably a nod to the prophesied 'Judgement Day' from the Terminator series). The synth soaked soundtrack really ties this film all together, bringing some of those childhood memories back as if this was a movie you used to wear out on your VHS tape player (or laser disc) growing up.You would expect a lower budget, straight to VOD movie like this to feel cheapened by the over use of un-refined CG, but the filmmakers stayed true to the roots of the movies they wanted to homage and many scenes were done with in camera make up and effects (always a great thing).If you're like me and you just can't get enough of the 80's, watch this movie. These guys did a great job making something new feel old all the while maintaining their own originality without going so far over the top (such as something like Kung Fury) that there are parts of the movie you can actually take somewhat seriously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EPEJX2A7ERYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QD74N2#wasThisHelpful","R3EPEJX2A7ERYV","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost two thirds of the movie is mostly just meaningless dialogue (albeit some character development), but if you're going to name your movie ""Monsters"", you'd better make sure there are lots of monsters in it and that they are used properly.The storyline is pretty lame, and probably has some political subtext that could be made of it. Worse off is the 'monsters' in the movie were basically hiding the entire time until towards the end and the CG (from 2010) was nothing at all impressive.If you're able to look at the movie from the point that it was made with a very small budget (less than $500k) then you may be able to appreciate it some. Frankly I've seen movies that are much better than this made on an even smaller budget.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6JONPL5VAF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044BY98K#wasThisHelpful","R1E6JONPL5VAF9","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often that you'll run across a low budget gem similar to The Terminator, in fact it almost never happens. While this is not necessarily an example of that happening it is a pretty cool trashy 80's sci-fi flick that deserves some recognition. No doubt hugely influenced by Blade Runner, the first few minutes of this movie shows off a pretty creative futuristic world haunted by things known as 'Trancers', not quite Replicants and not quite zombies.If you can allow yourself to enjoy a movie that was clearly made off of an incredibly low budget ($300k) with pretty cheesy and cliché dialogue (part of it's charm) then you'll appreciate what Trancers has to offer. You'll also get to see a very young (and pretty) Helen Hunt doing a movie that she probably tried very hard to bury in her filmography. Sometimes it's good to watch something on the opposite end of the blockbuster spectrum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PF5E38DZMOPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCDUG8K#wasThisHelpful","R3PF5E38DZMOPI","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tony Scott, may he rest in peace, began his Hollywood career with a very unusual and what would come to be a very uncharacteristic art-house film about a dying vampire, played by Glam Rock superstar David Bowie.The way the movie first starts out you may think it's going to be a roaring spectacle of gloriously trashy 80's horror, however it quickly slows it's pace and reveals it's true nature. Susan Sarandon, before her days of big fame, plays the possible savior to Bowie's character Blaylock (possibly a reference to Orlok, vampire in Nosferatu).There is a certain elegance to the cultured vampire, the one that makes blood consumption look like an art form, the one that has collected priceless antiques over centuries, the one who's silver tongue pours out such seductively irresistible eloquence. Accompany that with some classical music and sheets blowing in the wind and the result is a pretty erotic scene.While the film is constructed relatively well, and there are really no complaints about the acting, story etc, it was a little slow for my taste in vampire flicks. The cinematography does have a distinct look, the entire film is veiled in a blue hue which does contribute to an eerie atmosphere.It's important to note Dick Smith ""The Godfather of Make-Up"" was in charge of the make up effects in this film, he also did the aging effects in The Godfather, Little Big Man and many more. There is also a quick bit part in the film from later famous actor Willem Dafoe playing a street thug.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVP8I374LQ0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LJAECY#wasThisHelpful","R2IVP8I374LQ0W","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The spectrum of horror movie fans and/or people who would watch a movie like this is very broad. Some people just want to watch a flick like this with their girlfriend/boyfriend for the jump scares, others just want to watch a movie like this in hopes that they will see a host of teenagers slashed to ribbons, but some want to see a well developed story with a creepy atmosphere.There is no 'one size fits all' in the horror genre. Everyone likes something different. In saying that you have to take this movie for exactly what it is. It is a low budget ($2M) atmospheric horror/thriller, filled with unknowns and written and directed by an ""unknown"" filmmaker, who won't be unknown for much longer.Don't read too much into the approach, this is one of the most unique horror movies to come out this millennium. Let me reiterate, I am NOT saying this is the best horror movie of the 21st century, I'm saying it is one of the more unique horror movies of the past 15 years. Not a slasher per se, supernatural in that something is happening that can not be explained by science but not a fantasy and no technical possessions (that we know of at least).If you want cheap thrills, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you want to see tons of blood and gore, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you just want to see a slew of teenagers being massacred, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. However if you want to see something different done in this genre, someone taking horror back to being an art of pacing, the creation of an atmosphere (very well illustrated by Disasterpeace's score) that is all together unsettling, WATCH THIS MOVIE.The fast food, You Tube crowd that is handing out 1 star reviews can not possibly begin to appreciate something like this. Taking into account what I have told you, if you think this movie may be a good fit for you, watch it for yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFCIA30ZDPX9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVNN5W#wasThisHelpful","RFCIA30ZDPX9I","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Step number one in watching Marvel's Ant-Man is NOT to take it very seriously. The actors and filmmakers didn't and thats what works about this movie. Definitely the most comical of all the Marvel flicks thus far, Ant-Man is an enjoyable and lighthearted film that has a place in Marvel's Cinematic Universe but without any real consequences, yet.It's difficult to make a story about a man that can shrink to the size of an ant, dark or mysterious, so knowing that the studio set out to make a movie that would bring in another one of their characters with a unique and useful skill-set that doesn't have a particularly incredible or original storyline.

"Step number one in watching Marvel's Ant-Man is NOT to take it very seriously. The actors and filmmakers didn't and thats what works about this movie. Definitely the most comical of all the Marvel flicks thus far, Ant-Man is an enjoyable and lighthearted film that has a place in Marvel's Cinematic Universe but without any real consequences, yet.It's difficult to make a story about a man that can shrink to the size of an ant, dark or mysterious, so knowing that the studio set out to make a movie that would bring in another one of their characters with a unique and useful skill-set that doesn't have a particularly incredible or original storyline.

"Terminator Genisys is far and away the best Terminator movie since T2, despite it's PG-13 rating. The way that the director Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World) and the writers went about acknowledging the first 2 films while simultaneously writing a new story was something core fans can really appreciate.Of course most notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his return to the franchise for the first time in 12 years. Something that has bothered me since his Hollywood return has been the ""use and abuse"" of the acting/bodybuilding legend, adding extra puns into his dialogue and overall making him parody himself over and over. In this movie, they don't really do that. In fact for the first hour or so he takes a backseat to the story. They do of course use some of his trademarks that made him so popular over the years.One of the biggest complaints about this movie has apparently been Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor. One thing you have to keep in mind when watching a movie like this is that none of these actors will ever be able to portray any of these characters as well as they 20-30 years ago. While no Linda Hamilton, I thought Clarke's Connor was great and worked pretty well in conjunction with Jai Courtney's Kyle Reese.One of my only complaints about the film is that they would have cast a Robert Patrick lookalike (original T-1000) or even used some CG for the role of the T-1000 in the first half of the movie. If you are a real Terminator fan there are many things in this movie you will really appreciate about it. While of course an R-rating would be much more traditional (first 3 movies were R), they were very smart about the hard PG-13 packing in plenty of action and darkness to match the tone of the first 2 movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GT4EQAJ4A7SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01013I9DU#wasThisHelpful","R3GT4EQAJ4A7SL","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up watching all the great John Hughes 80's high school classics as well as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Better Off Dead and the other greats. How in all those years, I never came across Three O'Clock High is an absolute tragedy.Rarely talked about or referenced today and somewhat lost in the shadows of the immensely popular Hughes productions, Three O'Clock High stands entirely on it's own, not trying to be like anything else that has come before it. Instead this movie romanticizes one particular event, that event being the imminent threat of a high school bully.The film is made in a very artistic style, using the cutaways of the school clock to keep the pressure of the impending event ever present and shot surprisingly well for a film of this nature. The Tangerine Dream score calls back memories of another coming of age tale, Risky Business (also scored by Tangerine Dream)In a side note Jeffrey Tambor (of Arrested Development fame) makes an early career appearance in the movie as the manager of the student store.

"There is rarely as slick and smooth a movie as God of Gamblers for the first 30 minutes. Chow Yun Fat plays out a fantasy of the everyman and truly is the God of Gamblers, complete with a 3 piece suit, an 8 figure bank balance and a Rolls Royce to boot. However if you think this is the movie you are about to see, you're in for a big surprise.The film takes a pretty dramatic (or comedic) turn in tone and pace and starts into a much more light-hearted action comedy. However, in the final half hour or so the movie slowly begins to return to how it began.

"Within the first few minutes of the the film's beginning, it's sepia tone and 70's film grain already gives you this feeling that you're in for a very special experience.Throughout the history of cinema, spanning over a century, there have been a select few of motion pictures that have been consistently chosen to bare the ultimate title of ""The Greatest Film Ever Made"". The one movie that has most consistently been hailed as such, is The Godfather.Looking at this movie from an objective perspective it is not difficult to understand why, that is if you fully understand the art of cinema.Every decade audiences are dumbed down further and further by the mind numbing box office blasters of tomorrow, with more CG, more explosions and more action. Luckily, when it comes to those who's opinion actually counts (namely critics) there still seems to be a general consensus. While some may argue the aspects of Citizen Kane that make it the better film, it is difficult to argue against what does not make The Godfather superior.Over 40 years have passed since the release of the 1972 classic, and no other movie has even come close to taking the crown. Then again you don't see a whole lot of 3 hour long character study's anymore either.What elements are combined to make this such a great movie? Simply put, everything. The acting is some of the best you will ever see in any movie, the production and set/costume design is perfect and absolutely nails the films era' s, the music is unforgettable and works like an opera throughout the series, cinematography is masterful and the editing perfectly ties it all together (particularly in one of the final scenes).This movie may be more and more brushed off as time goes on being called ""overrated"" or ""boring"", but the truth is when the world ends, The Godfather will still be remembered as the Greatest Film Ever Made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M16EM33N5FGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DNPFUE#wasThisHelpful","R1M16EM33N5FGH","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great sounding beautiful looking classic style Fender amp. The Fender Champion 20 (not to be confused with the Super Champ) is a great, inexpensive, well designed amp that is just right for beginners. At 20 watts it can mostly just be used as a practice amp. The effects are very cool and really open the possibilities for lots of different sound combinations.One of the only things that kinda bothered me were the voices. Too many of the voices sounded the same. In my opinion Fender should never try to emulate a 'metal' or heavy distortion sound, they should stick to what they do best which is clean reverb sounds. This amp didn't quite work for me as I am not a beginner, maybe if it was a tube amp without all the effects it would have been what I'm looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQPQQO61KVF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EM5UOE6#wasThisHelpful","R1AQPQQO61KVF9","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a reason you don't see movies this well made anymore. Audiences now days can not handle a 3 hour long character study, they need action, and lots of it. The Deer Hunter is anything but an action movie. But what it is, is a masterclass in character development.This is real cinema.Movies like The Godfather, that take the first half hour of the film at a wedding just establishing characters and relationships celebrate the value of these scenes. Coincidentally, this movie begins with a wedding as well and 2 of it's stars also appeared in The Godfather films.The painting of a rural, cold, bleak steel town anywhere in Pennsylvania already makes you feel like nothing good can possibly come out of this. Back when acting was valued above all else, this movie thrives on it's dramatic scenes of tension with it's well developed characters, this makes for the greatest suspense. People who would become legends like Meryl Streep, Chris Walken, DeNiro and Cazale put in some of their best work of their careers (and the best of Walken's).The symbolism and the icon of ""The Deer Hunter"" as a person as well as an ideal is just subtle enough that it's not heavy handed and yet plays to perfection throughout the entirety of the film. The movie is so genuine you really feel like you are just watching the lives of a group of ordinary people.For those who have seen the movie more than once, you may have noticed there are many ""oners"" in the film, meaning continuous long shots without any cuts. This just adds to the epic long drawn feeling that the movie exemplifies.Before they leave for Vietnam Nick says ""Don't leave me over there"" to which Michael replies ""You got it"". When Mike comes back to bring Nicky home, the 3 hour film comes to a pinnacle. The hours we have spent getting to know these characters and seeing the love they have for each other is truly astounding. The fact that Michael was willing to take his own life to bring Nick home is a testament to the bond of war as brothers in arms.As far as Vietnam War movies go The Deer Hunter is one of the best (easily top 5). It takes the depth of the war and it's impact on real people to a level very rarely explored.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZ20KJA8XVRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA5KL7U#wasThisHelpful","R1QZ20KJA8XVRR","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gamers these days take just about every opportunity they get to complain about why something isn't a specific way that they want it. I suppose it all goes with the ""entitled"" generation, but I personally found lots to enjoy about this game.First off, something that I'm sure has already been well documented, these graphics will really blow your mind. I have been gaming since the SNES days and this game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console by far.The aesthetics are all on point and I particularly love the whole Victorian era/Tesla-punk style that incorporated werewolves and vampires as well as other gothic lore such as the Order itself.Now on to the criticisms. The first issue I had is a relatively small one and frankly just means that I liked the game so much I wanted more of it! People that complain about spending ""X"" amount of dollars on a video game to only get ""X"" amount of hours of gameplay are impatient and clueless. It's not about the amount of time you can play the game, it's about the quality of the experience. If someone gave you the game for free does your opinion change?I didn't have a problem with the story but in a hopeful sequel I would like to delve more into the world and factions of The Order. I also think there needs to be more RPG elements to the game, most games these days either include RPG elements, open world elements or both, so to play a game without either seems a bit limited.Finally the weapons. While the weapons were pretty sweet (especially the Tesla ones), there wasn't enough specialty weapons or items. Not being able to carry more than 1 rifle and 1 sidearm, while it seems realistic, did get frustrating at times.I liked this game a lot and I know Ready At Dawn, who is still a young studio, will take fans opinions into consideration if and when they decide to go for a sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAY0YZ1PF54PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBLBMBQ#wasThisHelpful","RAY0YZ1PF54PW","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was able to get the 38"" Vizio soundbar for $100 with free shipping right after Christmas. I have never had or needed a soundbar until recently so after seeing the reasonably good reviews for this here on Amazon I decided to give it a try.I was already wary of purchasing any equipment from Vizio as they do not generally have the most reputable products. Since the placement of this sounbar wasn't overly important I figured it was worth checking out, here is my assessment.This bar does not come with a subwoofer, so if you are interested in this being used as your primary sound system, you may want to look elsewhere. Because I am only using this for the TV in my bedroom, all I needed was something a bit louder and more balanced for dialogue. For that purpose the soundbar works just fine. However, compared to the sound from the TV there is honestly not that dynamic a difference. Because I only spent $100 on this there isn't a whole lot to regret but I would not pay anymore than I did and if I had to do it again I'd probably just use my Bose Sounddock as a replacement system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5XR4Y7PTHXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG6FOV0#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5XR4Y7PTHXN","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diner is essentially a movie about nothing. It is a plotless, hardly structured film that has no specific intention. It also just so happens to be one of the greatest coming of age films ever made. Director Barry Levinson romanticized his adolescence and growing up in Baltimore in the late 1950's (59 in the movie) to create this love letter to his home city.The cast of this movie is just perfect. A group of young actor's who hadn't all quite made a name for themselves yet (some of them well on their way). Just getting together, bonding in a very natural way you would expect a bunch of young guys to do so. Each of these actors went on to do at least 1 memorable movie in their careers not long after, Kevin Bacon (Footloose), Mickey Rourke (Pope of Greenwich Village), Steve Guttenberg (Short Circuit), Paul Reiser (Aliens) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone).For me this is the kind of movie that I could pretty much just put on anytime (particularly on a sleepless night). The comradery of the characters in this film makes you feel like these are people you may have once known or at least wanted to know at one point in your own life. That the whole movie revolves around the 'Diner' is a testament to the fact that, everyone had ""that"" hangout spot growing up. For Barry Levinson living in Baltimore it was the diner.This movie made such an impact on me as a teenager that I actually made my wife take a pop culture test before I would marry her (true story). Because the movie doesn't have the standard ""Setup, Conflict, Resolution"", there is nothing to rush.

"Liam Neeson has become known for the cadre of action movies he has appeared in over the past decade. While this is NOT an action movie, it is still a similar typecast role. I have really liked some of the other stuff writer/director Scott Frank has done (wrote and directed The Lookout, wrote Minority Report), so I decided to give this one a shot.The aesthetics in the film were very dark and very gritty, which worked perfectly for this late 90's New York City crime drama. However, I feel like the dark and gritty aspect may have been 'taken' a bit too far. *SPOILER* On one side you have the criminals in the movie, who were evil, vile men who did horrible things to women, and on the other side you have a former alcoholic cop who (in his drunkenness) shot and killed a little girl. This makes it hard to root too much for him (unlike Taken's Bryan Mills).Because the protagonist essentially has no one and nothing, you would kinda be ok if he died at the end of the film. So as it would happen, justice and/or vengeance is achieved at the end of the film, but then the movie ends... and you still feel like something is still wrong.

"5 years ago who would have thought this kind of technology would be so readily accessible so soon? I am an experience kinda guy, I love anything that is going to give me a more immersive experience, be it 3D, D-Box motion seating or synchronized lighting. The first time I even saw that this product existed was during an episode of 12 Monkeys on the SyFy channel. As soon as I saw that the show was integrated to work with the Philips Hue lighting system and would change colors to reflect what was happening in the show, I knew I needed to have it.First of all, I love the concept 100%. It being a 'Smart Bulb' and running through the internet is a great idea and one that will only be improved upon. The obvious problem is the price of these things. It is hard (and reasonably so) for most people to justify spending $60 on 1 single lightbulb. The fact that the Hue Bridge is NOT sold separately is also pretty disappointing. However, I am here to tell you, if you are anything like me it IS worth the jump. Hopefully there will eventually be a price drop (I'd feel much better about $40/bulb) but truthfully you only really need 2 bulbs per application.

It's a late 70's, grainy film, low budget cult film that worked perfectly all by itself.The fact that it may have paralleled the story about the 300 Spartans is great but frankly better left unsaid. In an attempt to somewhat 'modernize' this movie, adding the comic book transitions and prologue it effectively re-dated it and made it look much more cheesy and less genuine. This is unfortunately the only version of this movie you can find on blu ray so if you have to have it in hi-def you're pretty much stuck.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UIEROAE2EXUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBB8XS#wasThisHelpful","R2UIEROAE2EXUN","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most underrated, seldom talked about thriller's of the last 20 years. As soon as the movie starts, you already get this feeling like something just isn't right. It starts right away and it doesn't stop until the credits roll. Every time you think it's finally over, something else happens.They took a story that has been told many times before and made it gripping and intense. Kurt Russell delivers as usual and his supporting cast help make this little 93 minute flick one great thrill ride. It's a real shame that this one has still yet to make it to blu ray, there are thousands of movies on BR that aren't half as deserving as this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MD3FJMM3P2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFXKZ8#wasThisHelpful","R38MD3FJMM3P2S","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hideo Kojima, better known for the Metal Gear series, is obviously a very big fan of cinema. In his Twitter bio it says ""70% of my body is made of movies"", which should really say it all. As a fellow student of film there were many things that I noticed (and loved) that he did to homage several different seminal works of science fiction.To start off the game's most apparent influence is from the 1982 Ridley Scott directed film Blade Runner. Gillian Seed looks very much like the character Harrison Ford played, Rick Deckard, the 'Turbocycle' used in this game is just like the Police Spinners from the movie and even the skyline seen in the game resembles that of the fictional 2019 Los Angeles. Seed's entire objective in the game is to eliminate (or 'retire' as would be said in Blade Runner), these Snatchers, also the plot of the film.The second biggest inspiration , which should seem apparent, would be 1984's The Terminator. Besides the color of the glow in their eyes being green instead of red, the Snatchers look very similar to the Endoskeleton in The Terminator. The army of machines being created to destroy mankind is also the same theme that runs throughout the Terminator series.The music in the game played a very large role in the feel of this cyberpunk world of Neo-Kobe. In both Blade Runner and the Terminator the music was also pivotal throughout each film.The final major movie influence would be Invasion of the Body Snatchers (most likely the 1978 version). As these 'bioroids' attempt to assimilate the citizens of Neo Kobe, they snatch their bodies and replace them all the while trying to maintain appearances as if nothing has changed. Again, the plot of the aforementioned film.There was a little Alien reference in the game as well. One of the characters name is Harry, he is an older man that wears a boiler suit and a trucker hat, this was more than likely a reference to the character Brett in the 1979 film Alien and without coincidence was played by Harry Dean Stanton.Integrating all these familiar themes to create such a wonderful, if not terribly original, addition to the genre and at the same time creating a deeper narrative in the form of a video game allowing the player to make decisions was a very big accomplishment, especially for 1988 when the game was originally released.Kojima has always drawn his inspiration for his video games from movies. The protagonist in his most popular series (Metal Gear Solid) has a variable code name of 'Snake' and wears an eye patch (alluding to the character Snake Plissken from Escape From New York). While his nods may be less than subtle, that does not take away from his ability to be a master storyteller in a medium that he helped pioneer. Video games would not be the same today without him and for that I believe Hideo Kojima is indeed a true genius.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QENQMVTS82QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PQ2FE8#wasThisHelpful","R2QENQMVTS82QX","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Without question Enter the Dragon is the best Bruce Lee movie out there. Things that were exhibited in this film had not been previously demonstrated in any of Lee's other headlining movies, such as quality production design, substantial plot and characters and the use of Bruce Lee's actual voice which led us to finally hearing some of his spiritual insight and now some of his most famous quotes. Enter the Dragon is essentially a kung-fu/spy movie hybrid, looking to have been influenced by James Bond. Even the villain in the movie had James Bond villain traits, the white cat, a removable hand and a mirror room (featured in The Man With the Golden Gun).There are a few scenes where the dialogue is unbelievably corny (""Man, you come right out of a comic book""), and if it wasn't made in the 1970's that might be an issue. It is also not hard to see that there are very few actual martial artists in the film besides Lee. Unlike when you see a Jackie Chan movie where he has his own team of martial artists to help authenticate the fight scenes. It's a shame Lee passed away only days before this films release, it seems someone had just figured out how to capture the essence of his greatness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWN949URH61QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPJ5Z96#wasThisHelpful","RWN949URH61QO","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ventured out to build myself a home theater, looking for the best quality products without spending an arm or a leg on anything. I came by Carl's DIY section and after seeing all the good reviews decided to give the screen a shot. Here's the deal on the 'projector screen'. When you think of a projector screen you probably have an idea in mind of the type of material it's going to be. I paid the extra $20 to have the fabric rolled instead of folded, as I did not want to mess with having to get out any creases in the screen. As it turns out the material is very soft and pliable like fabric, opposed to a sturdier canvas like projector screen that I thought it would be, so I probably didn't need to spend the extra $20 after all.The quality of the fabric is good and seems to work well with a projected image. However, if you do not have a plan on exactly what you are going to do with the material, you may find yourself at a crossroads. Carl recommends buying lumber and constructing your own frame for the screen, then stretching the material over the frame, and stapling it to the edges, finally adding Carl's 'contrast boosting border' (very nice marketing phrase) to the edges of the frame. If that seems like an inordinate amount of work to you, there are other options.Since my projector didn't quite fill up the 66x110-inch space at the recommended viewing distance (most people's won't), I had to do something about the excess screen that was effectively washing out the picture. You will definitely need something to line the edges of your screen and ideally it should be black. What I did was first paint the wall I was projecting on black (highly recommended). After putting the fabric on the wall (which you have to be careful when doing so you do not create any ripples in the screen) I then hung a black piece of fabric on the ceiling so the projection would be absorbed rather than bounced off of the white ceiling. Finally I used the same black fabric to outline my screen so the only thing showing was the projected image. Overall, I would suggest this method or a similar one to save yourself excess time and money in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VNLI6HKKY17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KA07YM#wasThisHelpful","R36VNLI6HKKY17","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's rare that a film will exude such raw and powerful emotion that is just as rooted in truth as it is in it's fiction. When The Breakfast Club was released in 1985, teenagers of the era were stunned by the profound revelation of hearing and seeing problems that they actually experienced.In one way or another anyone could relate to one or more of the 5 archetypes and be emotionally invested in what they had to say. It isn't particularly surprising that over 25 years later many of these core issues remain the same in the life of the American adolescent.Each actor helped contribute their piece to this seminal film, but perhaps none better than Ally Sheedy's character, the basket case. The young actors connected with their characters enough to make them incredibly believable and thus they connected with their audience.

"Beautiful, comedic, inspired, adventurous, insightful and heartfelt, these are just a few of the adjectives that well describe Ben Stiller's  remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It is honestly one of Ben Stiller's best outings as an actor and probably the best film he's ever directed. One of the most interesting aspects about this movie is simply that you do not know what to expect next.The film is very well rounded and has a general appeal to all who would watch. Many may claim that the film is boring or too slow, unfortunately for them, they just aren't watching close enough. The movie is about Life, literally. The movie is about Life magazine and a 16 year tenured employee who has yet to do much with his. Something that you might not expect from a movie like this is the incredible cinematography (perfectly accented by the blu-ray release). There is much more to Walter Mitty than meets the eye and thats how the movie is too. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very enjoyable watch and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NS8L34LT2P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7KJTCG#wasThisHelpful","R30NS8L34LT2P3","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm the kind of guy that actually gives remakes like these a chance before condemning them, I even went to see the Total Recall remake in theaters. But there were things about this RoboCop remake that I just couldn't get over. First of all, taking the rating down to a PG-13 when remaking an R-rated film is usually a mistake. How could you possibly emulate the essence of the original film, known for it's particular brand of violence, by dropping the rating? On top of that not release an unrated cut?I was a fan of the tech in the 'not-too-distant-future', especially the Omnicorp machines, RoboCop's bike and all the hologram interfaces (even though they didn't do much for the cars but throw hubcaps on em). I was not really a fan of the over-emotional tone throughout the movie, there wasn't really enough run and gun action/violence to balance out all the ""I'm a monster"" scenes. When I first heard Joel Kinnaman from AMC's 'The Killing' was going to be the new Alex Murphy, I didn't know how I felt about it. After watching the movie and seeing that he basically plays a similar character, I still don't know how I feel about it.Samuel L Jackson's ""The Novak Element"" bit served as something of a right winged Greek chorus for the film and was mildly amusing. Finally at the end of the movie there is a big action scene, but the CG seemed a little too flimsy for it to feel authentic. Instead RoboCop ends up just looking like Spider-man jumping and flipping around. If you're a die hard fan of the original you probably won't care much for the remake, otherwise it's good for some entertainment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRA81DM5ST71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JL6L4WC#wasThisHelpful","R3BRA81DM5ST71","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Days of Future Past is a lot more than just an X-Men movie. It is the union of two X-Men film series', Bryan Singer's X-Men from 2000 and X2 2003 (as well as Brett Ratner's The Last Stand 2006) and Matthew Vaughn's X-Men First Class from 2011, with Singer returning to direct for DoFP. Based off of one of the most popular X-Men graphic novels of the same name, this movie experiments with the idea of time travel.From the second the movie starts we are thrown into an engrossing scene of explosive action. Without giving anything away, DoFP essentially acts as both a sequel to Singer's films and Vaughn's First Class. One of the most interesting aspect about this is that we are able to see original characters from the first X-Men movies as well as new characters from First Class and even more (there are tons of great easter eggs hidden throughout this one).There isn't a lot of over the top action in this X-Men movie like there is in some of the previous installments. Instead a much heavier focus is on the story, which is incredibly deep, and the characters, which are equally as complex. Overall there is a lot to enjoy about this entry if you are a fan of the previous films, it is indeed a contender for the best X-Men movie thus far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSJ616GV06M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7IPGS6#wasThisHelpful","R3FSJ616GV06M9","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No sweeping score, no dastardly villains and no incredible tension. When Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released in 1969, the Western genre of film was already decades old. The world had long since been introduced to John Ford and John Wayne, Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood, but what they hadn't been introduced to yet, was a movie like this. What you get when you watch this movie is a contemporary American Western classic.With one of the greatest onscreen pairings of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, this movie comes off as fun more than anything else. The music performed by Burt Bacharach and the addition of the song ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" is a huge change of pace from the grande Elmer Bernstein or whistling Ennio Morricone type scores. Not to say that it is completely devoid of all Western film archetypes. The movie is beautifully shot by Conrad Hall (Cool Hand Luke, The Professionals) and features great American Western terrain and landscapes.I wouldn't necessarily label Butch Cassidy as a Western Comedy, but you can't deny the comedic banter in the film. It's easy to watch, it's enjoyable, it's entertaining and sometimes it's even exciting, what else could you ask for?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KTJ5Q9J7VKOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014BQQYS#wasThisHelpful","R3KTJ5Q9J7VKOZ","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Theatrical Cut Review:Payback is a hard boiled, neo-noir crime thriller with comical and satirical elements, featuring a great Mel Gibson character and a straight up revenge plot.

"Although Bruce Lee had been in movies and television quite a while before this, The Big Boss was really his breakout movie. The martial arts scenes may not be very good and certainly pale in comparison to some of the Shaw productions of that time, but this movie was more of a segue to Lee's later and significantly better films.There is nothing special about the barely audible dialogue or semi-generic story, but what's more is that there are hardly any Bruce Lee fight scenes for the first 40 mins of the movie. The Big Boss has a raw classic 1970's cinema feel but one of it's biggest problems is that there is no driving force in the movie or interesting or memorable characters outside of Bruce Lee.Unfortunately the production quality of the film is pretty poor, the special effects are weak and it almost just seems like someone grabbed Bruce Lee, a camera and a couple of other guys with mediocre martial arts abilities then decided to make a movie. The dog dodging scene towards the end relies on very amateur trick photography and at this point is just comical. The films most redeeming quality is the final fight scene where, in his vengeance, Bruce Lee holds nothing back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E85XP64MRGC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015RCURS#wasThisHelpful","R1E85XP64MRGC5","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Desperado was Robert Rodriguez's first movie playing with house money, the result proved that he was indeed a capable filmmaker. Since the $7,000 budget of El Mariachi was financed solely by Rodriguez himself, being able to see what he could do with an incrementally larger budget ($7 million) gave him a chance to show that he wasn't just a one hit wonder.On the outside Desperado may just look like a generic 90's action movie with Mexican flair (it may on the inside a little too), but what it really showed was the potential of a talented filmmaker and ultimately the world that he would create with his Mexican Western trilogy. The nods to movies like Hard Boiled, Fistful of Dollars and various John Carpenter flicks aren't very hard to spot, luckily they became a bit more subtle in his films over time. One of the most notable things to come out of Desperado were the introductions of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek to the world, ultimately changing both of their careers forever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327LF0FAQLCEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000A2ZU1#wasThisHelpful","R327LF0FAQLCEM","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't be fooled by the generic title, this movie is anything but generic. As my review title suggests, the film looks to have had a clear influence from the American movie ""A History of Violence"". The same premise of a man with a history of violence taking on a new identity to escape his past is used in both films.One of the main differences between the films, aside from the obvious setting, is the detective and neo-noir element used in Dragon. Through the amazing cinematography we see a great scope of the world in Southern China, where a story is laid out in front of us, although it may not be exactly what it appears. This not an action movie but rather a well paced and well shot, story driven crime drama with kung-fu inspiration. The fight scenes in the film are intense and have been excellently choreographed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZLJNNFC6GU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XB07FU#wasThisHelpful","R2XZLJNNFC6GU1","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In The Mechanic (before Death Wish) Charles Bronson solidified his role in the creation of tough guy cinema, which essentially started with his role as The Man With the Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in the West. It is important to note that there is no character dialogue for the first 15 minutes of the movie. This element was basically born in the Spaghetti Western and demonstrated in Sergio Leone's masterpiece The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.Like Death Wish, The Mechanic exhibits many classic features of 1970's cinema. For example, towards the beginning of the film there are many psychedelic qualities that were influenced by the year of the film, 1972. No doubt The Mechanic showcases one of Bronson's best characters and keeps a solid story, but let's be honest, the supporting acts aren't great. Nevertheless, there is something about watching a movie about a hitman who has an appreciation for the arts. Luckily, unlike Death Wish, there were not a slew of sequels for The Mechanic (for obvious reasons).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MNWUE6S4RG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006FDAP#wasThisHelpful","R11MNWUE6S4RG0","A2R164STV36F6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R164STV36F6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Patrick Ness, as an author, has a voice that is so distinctly his own, that his books are incredibly easy to distinguish from the mass of all the other nearly-identical YA novels out there. And, while I am not always the biggest fan of his books, I AM ALWAYS a fan of his ideas and the unique style in which he hashes them out. Does that make sense? I admire his uniqueness and artistry as an author, though, in general I don't particularly love his books.Until now.The Rest of Us Just Live Here, is, by far, my favorite of his works to date. It manages to capture his unique twist on the world in the most perfectly nuanced way. It manages to be cheeky and clever, while also making fun of itself, and is still totally page-turning and immersive. I truly can't say enough about this book and how utterly unique it is - it's not hilarious, it's not genius, but it IS funny and smart, and unlike any other book you've read, in all the best kind of ways. It's predictable, in a sense, but the familiarity is due to the reverent satire woven throughout the story.

"So far I really like the projector. This is the second projector I’ve owned and there we a couple notable differences:This projector has a great lumen output of 3000 lumens. I could see the image clearly even with the windows open.The replacement bulb cost looks to be less than my current infocus projector… I shopped around a bit and found them for under $200.I also like the foam filter on the air intake. I’m sure it cuts down on noise and reduces dust intake.One thing I wasn’t super fond of was the limited projector location VS screen size ratio. I have a large living room and was hoping to put the projector on one end of the room, the screen on the other. Without reading the manual I set it up as such. I quickly found that as marketed, this is for home use, not a long conference room. When projecting across my long living room, the image was WAY larger than my screen. I tried leveraging both the mechanical adjustment on the top of the unit as well as the digital screen adjustments, but couldn’t get the image small enough. I’d say as a rule of thumb the diagonal size of your image is about the length the projector will need to be away from the screen.I think this is an economical, high performance unit built with maintenance and longevity in mind. More adjustability in the screen size would have been nice, but it’s all there in the marketing material and intended for home use… I think most “theater rooms” are smaller rooms in a basement and this projector would be perfect.Be warned though, like most projectors, this thing put out some serious HEAT. Where ever it is placed, make sure you have good ventilation!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PG15ODE5QBIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D7Y1XC#wasThisHelpful","R2PG15ODE5QBIQ","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I generally make a point to skip books that heavily involve infidelity, but I was interested in the premise of this one, so I made an exception. I was really surprised at how much I liked this book, based on the reviews that I read for it. Honestly, I felt like the main character Marci was NOT as unlikable as many reviewers said she was. I felt like instead of being an anti-hero character, as I had expected, she really was just a regular girl who sort of found herself in a bad situation. The book evoked real emotional responses for me, and I felt like the characters evolved. The little part in the middle where we get a few chapters set tn years in the past was a bit unconventional, but I felt really helped to hash out the characters better and give us a better picture of who they are. I didn't always buy some of the romantic interactions, and we weren't always shown why she makes some of the choices she makes, but this is a first novel, it can't be perfect. It's not exactly a light-hearted, funny read, but it's not as heavy and dreary as I had expected, either (based on other reviews).

I cannot resist anything cherry cola flavored! They are trying a new layering technique here, which I think really works. When you first put it in your mouth, all you taste is cherry. When you bite into it (and halleluia, they aren't as hard as normal tic tacs!!) you immediately get a tart burst of cola flavor. Because they have kept the two flavors separate, you get a TRUE cherry cola flavor.

These new crisps are the same seaweed snack but magically fused with a thin rice cracker.

First of all, I just don't think it pairs well with the seaweed and rice, and secondly, it's simply unnecessary! These would be fantastic without the sugar, so why add it??

"I was anxious to receive this product for multiple reasons:* Supply clean power to my router and modem* Extend internet connectivity through power outages* Mobile battery for rechargingAs a networking hobbyist I've invested a fair amount of time into my router configuration (DD-WRT). While I can export my config files, I'd rather be proactive in supplying clean power in an effort to extend device life. This product is marketed to provide constant voltage and frequency (115VAC +- 8%, 60Hz +- 1Hz).Being a hobbyist, I enjoy buying super cheap routers and flashing them with advanced (ie - expensive) software features. Unfortunately cheap routers implies low cost hardware... I figure that if I supply good clean power, I'll get longer life out of it.Along with many others, we've abandoned a traditional land line telephone - relying exclusively on cell phones. The trick is if the power goes out and our cell battery is low, it can induce a complexity in maintaining communication. Additionally, there may be times when the local cell tower also loses power along with the house. If my local ISP / DSL is still up this battery backup will provide about an hour of additional communication (internet based texting / facetime) incase of emergency.I really like the utility of the mobile battery. While the battery is charged in the device, it can also be charged with common USB cable. If you go on an extended trip this flexibility is great! The other cool thing is that when these batteries wear out, they're easily replaced some day.I have confirmed the unit's ability to power a light load in the case of wall power loss (un-plugged). I have not confirmed the exact time span of the battery feeding my modem and router but I'd expect at least 30 minutes...Things that would have been cool:A way to mute the lights.A way to choose light vs sound for power status notifications.Network connectivity telling me status:* power quality in* power quality out* Watts in* Watts out* battery state of charge* battery condition (estimated life)* time and date of last power outage* Estimated time on battery backup (relative to immediate load).So far I'm very happy with it though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCI8EAO6VCS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JHYQNC#wasThisHelpful","R2MCI8EAO6VCS0","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered what Amazon lists as a size ""XL"". I am already extremely leery of ordering clothing from Amazon because so much of it is ""Asian sizing"" which runs 1-2 sizes smaller than US sizing, and their listings rarely reflect this difference. But i checked the size chart for this product, and it seemed like the sizing they listed was accurate to ""US sizing"". So, I purchased the ""XL"", which is my normal size. What arrived, however, was very distinctly NOT XL. The tag inside says ""L/XL"" , which first of all, had I KNOWN that is how these pants were sized I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM! Anyone who is a size XL can tell you that ANYTHING listed as ""L/XL"" NEVER FITS. Amazon, you need to FIX that error in the listing!  So right off the bat I was unsure of these pants. They looked TINY, but i thought maybe they stretch a lot? Then, as I try to pull them up over my calves I realize there's NO WAY these are even a size US Large, let alone the XL they were supposed to be. Honestly, I'm SO MAD. These pants that ARE SUPPOSED TO BE a size US XL are actually more like a US Medium. Which means they are now wholly and utterly useless to me. Lesson learned, if you want cheap Chinese clothes, just buy them at Walmart where you can at least SEE the size of the clothes before you buy them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDM9SOD735MGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3G5HPG#wasThisHelpful","RDM9SOD735MGF","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After getting this item, I decided to use it in my PC instead of a Playstation… long story. I just formatted it and it ran in my PC – no big deal.Relative to the info above this is my review:Cons:  * For a drive specifically marketed for Playstation usage, I found the accompanying documentation rather weak. If you want to instructions regarding the installation into a Playstation, you’ll need to hit Google, Youtube, or the Seagate web site.  * Packaged as an “OEM drive”. This is fine for the Playstation, but if you want to use in a PC, you’ll need to come up with your own SATA cable and screws.Pros:  * Very slim drive – even among 2.5 drives.  * Seems fast in my desktop (I did not formally benchmark).  * Standard PC mounting holes facilitate usage in places other than Playstation.Overall it's a good drive no matter how you want to use it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22KDZBXPDF0TJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149QDBY2#wasThisHelpful","R22KDZBXPDF0TJ","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I often keep a few cans or boxes of tomato soup on hand for those times (in the fall or winter) when I need to whip up a quick dinner. I only used pre-made soups as a base for my own homemade soups when I don't have a lot of time. Throw in some rice, veggies, a little chicken or ground beef, and you have a lovely soup that doesn't taste like it came from a factory. This particular non-homemade soup is about average. It doesn't have any more or less flavor than its non-organic counterparts, and the texture is about the same as well. This really isn't anything fancy. Not great, not bad, it's just.... plain tomato soup. Does anyone actually eat tomato soup JUST plain? I mean isn't that just watered down tomato paste?

He is a born reader, always deep into some book or another, so although this is a bit meatier than books he has previously read, he is powering though it. Every day he reads a chapter or two and has LOADS of information to share with me about what he has read. Amazing facts and stories are coming out of his mouth at random times all day long and when I ask him where he learned what he is talking about the answer is always the same: ""I learned it from the Bubba Jones book!"" This wonderful book is filled full of geography, history, and science, all told in the frame of an engaging novel, and it includes cute illustrations and some handy maps of presumably real places.

"After several days of using the TP-Link AV1200, I can say I'm quite pleased with their performance.First, let me say that I am not using them in their most commonly intended environment and application. In reading their documentation, they seem designed to provide higher bandwidth and stable connectivity to devices like TVs. They're also MUCH easier to set up than secure WiFI. I think this would perfectly suit the bill for that application.My application scenario:I have a metal out building about 50 yards from my home. I have 220VAC to the building, but not ethernet cable. I fiddled around for over a year with wireless adapters / bridges / gateways, but was never happy with their reliability, security, or performance. I've been aware of these power line bridges for some time, but finally took the leap. I quickly learned a few things.1. The performance is improved by at least of factor of 10x when on the same 110V leg of your 220V breaker.2. There seems to be a performance drop going across multiple sub-panels (but still works!).3. In the few days I've been running them, they seem to handle HIGH ambient temps (130F) without issue (we are in Arizona in the summer!).So far I'm loving them. I'm sort of old school- if the PC is physically static (not a laptop), I vastly prefer a wired ethernet connection. These bridges are 100% transparent to my network - everything just works! I haven't tried WOL packets yet, but so far they totally meet my expectations. For my application - running across 3 subpannels, varying power wire gauges, all sorts of noise, etc -  I can still sustain 7 MB / s file transfers. Less than advertised, but a reasonable 100Mb/s connection in my book - kills my wireless attempts. I can now access my network and web with speed and security.If you're running WiFi to a desktop PC instead of these - you're doing it wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJES9CGCWMIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3QPG1A#wasThisHelpful","R2WJES9CGCWMIB","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, if you want to order these during the summer and/or you live in a warm climate, be warned that they will likely NOT be ""gummies"" when the arrive, but rather, each package will contain one long, sticky gummy that is QUITE difficult to extract from the package. Mine came to me in Arizona in July, BUT I actually grabbed them from my mail carrier at 9:30am, so they weren't on a hot porch all day, and weren't in a hot car for too long; and yet they were still a gelatinous mess that I had to stick int he fridge before I could even attempt to open. This is obviously more a function of Amazon's packaging and the USPS driving around in the heat rather than a reflection on the actual product, but it's something to be aware of.Second thing to be aware of - the FIRST ingredient is corn syrup. I get it, they're gummies, they aren't meant to be TOO terribly healthy. They're meant to pump you full of sugar that you will burn of quickly. But the corn syrup alone made me certain I'd never get these again after this box is finished. I work too hard on my body to be putting that kind of crap into it.The flavor is pleasant, though a little... strange? I guess it's all the electrolyte minerals. But it's an enjoyable little snack after a workout. Each package even contains 2g of protein, so they're not a total loss, nutritionally.Overall, the product really isn't THAT bad.

"This powder is a nice little tool to help get you through the day. It dissolves almost instantly and has no color or flavor. My favorite way to use this fiber powder and stay hydrated is to chop a strawberry in half, and a slice of lime, put them in my water bottle with one scoop of this powder, and add ice and water. I actually WANT to keep drinking instead of forcing myself to stay hydrated. The fiber gives you a little extra boost so that you're not ravenous. It just takes the edge of your hunger. Do remember though, that each serving is 30 calories. Which might not seem like much, but if you refill and put a scoop in 4 times a day, that's an extra 120 calories!

"Do you have daughters? Do they LOVE when you brush their nasty, tangled up hair after a day of playing and napping, crafting, eating, and sweating? HAHA! No, of course not.Before we discovered  this bush my daughters would always SCREAM when I told them to bring me their hairbrush. Nope, I promise there was no beating happening, just a loving mom brushing her girls' hair so they looked like someone cares about them. It always started and ended in screaming, with lots of screaming in between. No matter how gentle I was. No matter how much spray-in conditioner I used. No matter how many stories I told about how I hated having my hair brushed as a girl, too.  No matter how many times I threatened to have their hair cut short. NOTHING fixed the hairbrushing screaming fits.UNTIL THIS BRUSH!I am convinced it is made from the bristles of a magical fairy-enchanted animal, or some such. No more crying. No more fighting. Just sweet, well-groomed little girls who no longer look homeless all the time. Thank you WetBrush, you have saved my sanity, and saved my daughters years of therapy as adults.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4DKE78X15XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WWQXB6#wasThisHelpful","R2J4DKE78X15XO","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have wide feet and a medium arch, my ideal shoe size is a 7.5 wide, but I can often squeeze into a 8 medium. I LIVE in Sanuk yoga mat flip flops ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. I live in Arizona, so this is no exaggeration (I even have them in four colors!). But for my most recent vacation I knew I'd need something a little more substantial. These shoes were purchased before my trip where I knew I would be walking on a lot of rocks at the beach while exploring tidal pools and coral reefs. They were also worn while making a long, steep hike up and down a costal cliff and on asphalt and sidewalk in town. They were a little tight to get on, but once they were on they fit fine - and of course, I want them to be a LITTLE tight so they don't get yanked off by a strong wave! They are pretty cute as far as water shoes go, better looking in person than they are in the listing picture. I wore them all day every day for four days straight of snorkeling, body surfing, and exploring, and never once missed my flip flops. At one point in the afternoon on my first day of wearing them I looked down at my feet and was SURPRISED to see these Speedo watershoes on my feet! They were so comfy and unobtrusive that I absolutely forgot I was wearing them!

Some of the vocabulary is a bit over the head of the demographic this is aimed at, I wish that the God element wasn't so subtle, and it would be nice if the unconditional love was shown ALONG SIDE healthy discipline.

It was also cute to have a bit of Australian quirk.

"I am normally a size 20W, so, after reading reviews I ordered a 22W and it fits very well. Maybe slightly big, but snug enough to not pop off in waves. I'm glad I ordered a size up.They are far more flattering, in my opinion, than the standard plus-size swim suit bottoms with a too-little skirt over top - those just scream ""I'm insecure about my legs! Don't look at them!!"". I can say that because just last week I wore a pair of those to the beach. I'm so glad I have these now!The length is good (although I'm a mom, another inch in length would be nice), I love that it has pockets, and I would feel comfortable wearing these at the beach all day, and walking to get lunch, too.My only complaint is that there is a weird insert sewn in that is meant to act as swimsuit bottoms. It doesn't fit as well as the shorts and feels very awkward. I plan to wear these shorts with a one piece suit and a rash guard over top, so I don't need TWO bottoms underneath the shorts. I may cut that section out of the shorts (as a fairly accomplished sewer, I can attest that this is easily done without real damage to the item). The fly is velcro, which some people take issue with, but I think it's just fine. Like I said, I'll have a real suit on underneath, and it's nice to not have to fiddle with ties when you're all wet.So, in all, I recommend these, but keep in mind that nothing is perfect!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2772WKGKHP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009046KUG#wasThisHelpful","R3O2772WKGKHP3","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am already a kale chip fan. I have bought many varieties and made many of my own at home. No need to convince me that these are a delicious snack. THIS particular brand and flavor of kale chips, however, while good, is not my favorite.For one, even though it has an oxygen absorber in it, they were not very crisp when I received them. I live in ARIZONA. I can't even imagine how un-crisp these might be if you live in an actual humid climate.Two, the flavor is pretty mild in my opinion. But I tend to like very spicy, super flavorful things. It was a nice, subtle flavor, but don't expect it to taste like doritos. I'd love to try their mango habenero flavor!Three, and this is an issue with ALL kale chips, they are not a frugal snack! Kale is cheap. Nutritional yeast is reasonably priced. I have NO CLUE why these things are always so pricey!That being said, between myself and two of my kids, one entire bag was GONE within five minutes of delivery by the mail man :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZMGBM9D3AEIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2RRWNG#wasThisHelpful","RZMGBM9D3AEIA","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sweet devotional to do nightly with your kids. There is nothing wrong with it, it has cute illustrations, everything is easy to understand, and helpful for starting conversations. But the age range listed is 4-8years old - I have a 2, 4, and 7 year old and I can tell you right now that after only a few days of reading this, most of the contents of this book is old news to my 7 and 4 year olds. They have heard all of this simplistic stuff before and want to hear ACTUAL Bible stories, and read things that are longer than one short paragraph. Of course, it's over the head of my two year old, so I may save it and do it with her in another year when she is three. But my 4 and 7 year olds require a little more substance in their devotions. My 7 year old does some on his own, since he can read, but I still need to find something for the four year old that will help her grow.

"This book was nothing like I expected it to be. Sure, I read the synopsis and had a vague idea, but there was so much more happening in this story than I had anticipated. For starters, this book is HILARIOUS. Not dripping with sweet cheesy romantic buffoonery in the least - but honest, true, authentic humor with some darkness and grit peppered in just to make it authentic. Sure, it has some parts that are a bit hard to believe, but what book doesn't? It also has many, many more f-bombs than most books of this sort usually have - see, I said there's nothing sappy sweet here! And, for me at least, the main character was INCREDIBLY easy to identity with... maybe I need some fake rehab, too?  Anyway, you know it's a good book when you're sad that you've finished it.

"I really hate to write a bad review. But if an item is truly deserving of it, I feel I have no choice.Let me begin by saying that I am an official ""Blender Snob"". I worked for over six years in a popular smoothie shop and became quite familiar with what a GOOD blender should be able to do. Currently I own a 1500W Blendtec blender and it is my BABY. I use it daily and love it immensely... but it isn't cheap. I was interested in trying this Nesco blender to see if there was a cheaper alternative that I could recommend to friends, as I am asked often what blender they should buy.Here's a hint. This isn't it.After loading the blender with the standard ingredients for a milkshake and hitting the button marked ""smoothie"" it quickly became clear that this machine couldn't handle it. There was NOT an excessive amount of ice, and I added more liquid than was necessary just to help lubricate the blending process. After the first round on the ""smoothie"" setting, not much had happened. I added MORE liquid, loosened up the ice and ice cream in the carafe, and tried it again. THIS TIME the motor REALLY couldn't handle it, and for some reason and continued to run WITHOUT turning itself off. As a result the room filled with stinky plastic-smelling smoke and my counter was covered in black soot under the blender! I dumped the still unblended contents into my Blendtec carafe and had a perfect milkshake in less than 30 seconds.Perhaps I got a faulty product. But, according to my husband who is an electrical engineer who works in the design and manufacturing of machinery, a simple circuit breaker or extra fuse (like the ones provided in Christmas lights) would cost the company between 5 cents to a dollar per machine, and could have prevented the damage that was done to the machine. So, faulty or not, the design is poor.After this incident I did not give up. Then I tried the ice function with just a carafe full of ice. The IDEA of the ice function is great. The execution, not so much.Then I tried blending a normal smoothie, no ice cream, just fruit, juice, and ice. Again, bad results, smoke and soot. To make it fair I also blended an almost identical smoothie in my Blendtec for comparison. The Blendtec smoothie did just fine, the Nesco one was not.The reason why I am giving this, in my experience, TERRIBLE blender two stars instead of one is the carafe. It is well-designed! Nothing out of the ordinary, but it is a quality piece of work, and I love the smaller opening on the lid to allow for adding things mid-blend. I wish my Blendtec lid had that feature! Although I will say that when the lid is firmly in place it is VERY difficult to remove - it usually results in splattering some of the contents all over the counter. Maybe i should take off that second star after all? Naw, I'll play nice. Point is, if you've stuck with me and read the review this far already then you know - i do NOT recommend this blender. AT ALL.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZXTZYOFBCPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUAK0FC#wasThisHelpful","R2YZXTZYOFBCPV","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Eden West is a book that I looked forward to reading, was intrigued by every page, and gladly finished. There are even some moments of gorgeous and profound prose that I enjoyed reading over a few times. The ending may be a bit vague for some readers' tastes, but I quite enjoy it when an author allows the reader some creative license. So why only three stars? While I enjoyed it all, and the ending didn't bother me, I just felt that the story lacked cohesiveness. There were several elements that I just couldn't grasp the significance of, and felt like they were left a bit undone - not in a creative way, but in an unthoughtful way. I kept thinking that these things had been added for a purpose... and then that purpose really didn't quite reveal itself.

"The information that IS in this book is concise, well-presented, and useful. It has nice illustrations. But that's about all the praise I'm going to give this book.I'm just guessing here, but based on the information (or lack thereof) and maps (I use the term loosely) in this book, I'm going to say that the author only conducted research on and only made research trips to the Grand Canyon, Phoenix, and Tucson. There is a WHOLE LOT more to Arizona than just those three regions. Though, to be honest, I grew up in the Phoenix area, and until I moved away, I thought those were the only noteworthy regions of Arizona, as well.Currently, I am raising my own family at the foot of the Hualapai Mountains. Oh, what's that? You've NEVER HEARD OF THEM? Exactly. No one has. Because NO ONE WRITES ABOUT THEM (for the record, is it a range that encompasses over 1,300 square miles of granite mountains with ponderosa and pinon pines, with its highest peak at an elevation of 8,417 feet, and a rise of over 6,000 feet in elevation from the surrounding desert floor - but this sky island range is not mentioned even ONCE in this book). It is incredibly difficult to find out ANY information on the plants and wildlife that are specific to this unique portion of Arizona. While this area is technically in the Mohave Desert (Mojave if you're a Californian), this specific Northwestern corner of Arizona (South of the Grand Canyon, to the West of the Colorado River and North of Lake Havasu), is quite different than the rest of the Mohave desert, and quite different from the rest of Arizona. The Mohave desert is mentioned, ever-so-briefly, maybe two or three times in this ""resource"". We are the forgotten stepchild of Arizona. Which is truly sad because this region has so many unique and beautiful features that few people ever see or hear about. Absolutely NONE of which are mentioned in this book, which claims to tell of ""The Nature of Arizona"" (granted, you'll find no words like ""complete"" in the title, so the author has a loophole). To be fair, my beef here is not just with THIS author, it is that NO ONE seems to remember this gorgeous corner of Arizona, and NO ONE seems to have written about it!There are so many birds and plants that we come in contact with here that I simply cannot find in any book. Locals have names for them and stories about them, but I'd sure love to have a book that has scientific facts and drawings. For example, my kids and I have tried for months to identify three species of birds that frequent our garden and have been unsuccessful because of the lack of publication on this region. Even talking to friends at Fish and Game has yielded uncertain results.The MOST glaring example of missing information in this book is the absence of the Mohave Green Rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus). It is widely said to be the most deadly snake in North America. They are aggressive and have been known to CHASE after people. No joke. They are quite prolific here in Mohave county, and they slither across my property regularly. They can be found from California and Nevada, down through Southern Arizona and pretty far South into Mexico. But is this common and very deadly snake mentioned in this book? Nope.Another terrible over sight: invertebrates. Want to guess how many pages are on invertebrates in this book? TWO. No, not two double-sided pages, JUST TWO. That comes out to exactly SEVEN invertebrates mentioned. Want to guess how many unique species of invertebrates Arizona has? I don't know the exact number, but after living more than 30 years in Arizona I am going to guess that the number is upwards of 10,000 species that are prevalent in the Southwest, and specifically Arizona. Seriously. And it lists only one type of scorpion when I know for a fact that i have seen with my very own eyes at least for different species in Arizona. How about spiders? Just the black widow and the tarantula. No mention of the Arizona Brown Spider (a highly dangerous cousin of the brown recluse, a camel spider (when you see one you will NEED to know what it is!) the huntsman spider, the wolf spider, the list could go on for paragraphs. This lack of highly pertinent information is just plain insultingly negligent.Again, the information that IS presented here is *mostly* fine, and, to my knowledge, pretty accurate. But I'd LOVE to see a new edition that actually talked about the plants, animals, and ecosystem where my family lives. We the people of Mohave County, Arizona are tired of our region being overlooked!  Tell me, have you read this book and noticed basic information missing about YOUR section of Arizona? I'd love to know if this book is cheating the readers out of other pockets of information.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16AUUTNWFPT88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583553002#wasThisHelpful","R16AUUTNWFPT88","A5H8NA5CJ0FK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5H8NA5CJ0FK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am always easily snared by anything to do with Jonah; the Biblical account speaks to me and plight of the human condition, reconciling our free will with a God who has big plans. Anyway, I should have known better. Nothing is as good as the original, right? This book starts off quite well, but like quicksand, you slowly sink in and it becomes a chore to read.

"LOVE this collapsible bottle! I used it recently on several airplane trips across the country and back and it was awesome. Easy to collapse, easy to fill, easy to clean, clips to my carry on bag, and easily tucks inside empty or full.Two small issues (not bad enough to knock a star off, though!) are that, ONE because it is made of silicone it collects lint and hair and gross stuff like crazy. A quick rinse cleans it off, but after it rolls around in my bag and on the floor of the airplane it's pretty nasty. The second issue... I don't know how to say this without sounding completely dumb... it's tricky to drink out of at times. I swear, I am in my 30's and have a college degree, but if you're not paying attention, this water bottle has a learning curve.

I know this isn't for tweens who are more advanced, but my seven year old can process more complexities than this book offers up, and I'd like him to get a little more actual BIBLE in his devotional. As it stands, most days we still do some Bible study together in addition to this. It's good for us to discuss it together, but I wish THIS book was more of a starting point for us.

"Love the concept of this power station. It  has everything, including an attached micro USB cable and two USB ports. I love that it not only gives back the outlet you use up, but also another one. Who wouldn't love this?? It is quite literally everything that it claims to be. The plugging in to the USB ports is not as smooth as it would be in your device's manufacturer's charging cube, but that's a minor complaint.However, it should be noted that it's great in theory that the USB charging ports are 2.4 amp, so as to charge your devices faster.

"THE AVIATOR’S WIFE REVIEWFictional history, if done right, is my favorite read.  Unfortunately, it is very often done poorly, producing books that frustrate and irritate me for their lack of authenticity.  We need to talk about Melanie Benjamin, author of “The Aviator’s Wife.”  And we should speak glowingly and with great admiration.  She always seems to get it right, a tribute to her research, dedication, and resolve.Benjamin, in her book notes, states that she wanted to tell the story of a famous woman who few people really know, who has a hero for a husband whom she supports without question, who is hounded constantly by the press, and who, after an early life of reticence, finally emerges as resilient and outspoken, very much her own woman and deserving of her own accolades.  The author has done that with wonderful style.Charles Lindbergh was the wildly celebrated aviator who made a 1927 solo flight across the Atlantic that secured his place in American history.  Anne Morrow was the shy daughter of a U.S. Ambassador, often overshadowed by her father and her radiant older sister, who inexplicably captured the attention of of the most revered man in America.  Their life together was full of achievement, sporadic happiness, tragedy, secrecy, abandonment, and, finally, revelation.  Not many know of the turmoil between Anne and Charles, or the dysfunction in their family.  Benjamin has researched it, analyzed it, and, with her marvelous writing skills, reimagined the emotional truths behind this remarkable relationship.It’s a political story of an American hero with somewhat treasonous leanings, an anti-Semitic who held unfavorable opinions about the policies of his country during the early years of World War Two.  The aviator’s wife who, at first, wasn’t brave enough separate herself from her husband’s domination, eventually disavowed his beliefs and emerged as perhaps the most fearless and courageous of the two, insisting on honesty and seeking answers about Lindbergh’s double life as he approached death at age 72.It’s also the story of their children.  The eldest, Charles, Jr., was tragically kidnapped and murdered.  The couple’s other five children struggled with personality disorders and the specter of having parents and a family life in disarray.  It is also revealed that Charles fathered seven other children with different partners as he roamed around the world doing his notable work while his family struggled at home without his presence.Historical fiction fans, in search of marvelous writing, must not ignore Melanie Benjamin’s novels.  She has recently released “The Swans of Fifth Avenue,” a penetrating look at Truman Capote.  Her talent is obvious in all her books, and is particularly shining in Aviator’s Wife.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0IGHD50O131/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BA1PXMI#wasThisHelpful","R2W0IGHD50O131","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FLASHMAN AT THE CHARGE REVIEWGeorge MacDonald Fraser (2 April 1925 – 2 January 2008) was a prolific Scottish author who wrote historical novels, nonfiction books, and numerous screenplays.  His notorious Flashman series was based on the antics of the protagonist Tom Brown in “Tom Brown’s School Days,” created by Thomas Hughes in 1857, where a coward and a bully becomes a hero.  The series, “The Flashman Papers,” became a popular sensation, and the bawdy, and often socially incorrect adventures of Harry Flashman, a British soldier during the 19th century, is perhaps Fraser’s best-known works.“Flashman at the Charge,” published in 1973, is the fourth in the 12-book series centers on Flashman’s escapades during the Crimean War, including the famous Charge of the Light Brigade, where Flashman always prevails in spite of trembling fear and loose bowels.  He is not a brave man and tends towards constant self-disparagement, but the circumstances he finds himself in seem to always turn in his favor.  A similar theme forms most of the Flashman storylines, and if it were not for Fraser’s historical knowledge and hilarious writing skills, the Flashman line would probably die the death of monotony.  But, I have always enjoyed the irreverent series, as apparently do many others, and enjoy reading about an anti-hero who prevails in spite of himself.The dialogue is authentic, uproarious, and filled with dry wit.  The battle scenes are intricate and well presented, with heroic antics that are not intended to be noble.  Fraser keeps a close hand on the intended character of Flashman, making his deeds notable, if not fearless.  His boudoir escapades are more amusing than licentious.Yes, I enjoy Harry Flashman.  I think many people associate his tentative approach to life with their own, hoping to achieve much honor without a lot of heroic effort.  If that fits your secret personality, Flashman is your savant.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30R23QVAPD9YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452264138#wasThisHelpful","R30R23QVAPD9YN","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"STELLA REVIEWThe Holocaust is recent history that is imbedded in the brain of most humans today.  The systematic annihilation of Jews by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1945 has been documented in every conceivable way, yet what do we really know?  Constant new revelations come forward to shock and repulse us, generating new feelings that add to our personal perspective of an evil time.Enter Stella Kübler-Isaacksohn nee Goldschlag, a German Jewish woman of startling beauty and ambition, with a dogged sense of survival for self and family, who engaged in the heinous activity of exposing Berlin’s underground Jews and revealing them to Gestapo authorities, leading to the imprisonment and deaths of untold numbers of people desperately seeking safety.“Stella” is Peter Wyden’s 1992 biography of his childhood fantasy girl, a German Jew with luminous blonde hair, sparkling white teeth, and a winning, flirtatious personality.  Her shapely bare legs in gym shorts fueled his adolescent dreams.  She was his schoolmate and choir mate, always near but as distant as the farthest star.  Stella Goldschlag created a lasting imprint on his brain.Wyden and his parents, through good fortune, escaped the early Hitler years.  Stella was trapped in Berlin when the cleansing began and, inexplicably, became a Nazi collaborator, giving up her fellow Jews to the Gestapo leading to some being imprisoned and exterminated in the concentration camps.  When Wyden returned to Germany after the War as part of the United States occupying force, he discovered the horrendous story of his glamorous classmate’s life as a “catcher” of Jews and resolved to uncover her story.  It took forty-six years to generate this book.The Holocaust is a complicated and emotional time in our history.  Countless accounts of all its hideous aspects have been written.  Wyden has done his research and his accounting is factually accurate, at least as accurate as can be determined by the veracity of emotional recollections.  I learned some new facts about the conduct of the purge that made the book worth reading.I struggled, however, with the author’s narration when it came to the actions of Stella.  There was too much ambiguity and too many gaps in her story.  In the end, I found I didn’t really know Stella very well.  I’m not sure Wyden ever did either.  The book was published in 1992 and didn’t contain the information that in 1994 Stella committed suicide by jumping out of the window of her apartment.  One could sense, by Wyden’s final conversations with her that she was emotionally unstable and the ending was not far off.  It appears, however, that Wyden didn’t see it coming.This is a dark read with many flashbacks and characterizations.  It’s interesting, however, and well worth the read to get a fascinating look at a different aspect of the Holocaust.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W4OE6KVP4S6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671673610#wasThisHelpful","R3W4OE6KVP4S6Y","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TWAIN’S END REVIEWIf Kitty Kelley is called the Queen of Mean for her unauthorized biographies of contemporary celebrities, what should we call Lynn Cullen?  Kelley has earned that label by spearing such luminaries as Frank Sinatra, Oprah Winfrey, Nancy Reagan, the Bush clan, and Jackie Onassis.  Cullen has produced accounts of the lives of Rembrandt’s wife, Cornelia; Edgar Allen Poe’s paramour, Frances Osgood; Juana of Castile, The Mad Queen of Spain; and portraitist Sofonisba Anguissola, lady-in-waiting to Spain’s Queen Elizabeth.  Both Kelley and Cullen have presented impropriety and scandalous behavior in their accounts but Kelley’s work is more “National Enquirer,” while Cullen is more David McCullough using a meticulous historian’s approach.  Her biographies of notable people of the past use a gentler, more scholarly tone.I prefer Cullen’s work.  In her latest book, “Twain’s End,” she reimagines the personal life of America’s most famous and successful writer, Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), and his strange relationship with his private secretary, Isabel Lyon.  In 1909, after a six-year friendly alliance filled with abiding trust, Twain wrote a 400 plus-page tirade, calling Isabel “a liar, a forger, a thief, a hypocrite, a drunkard, a sneak, a humbug, a traitor, a conspirator, a filthy-minded and salacious slut pining for seduction.”  After years of devoted service, Lyon had evidently p!&$*d Twain off.  He continued to publicly belittle her for a year until his death in 1910.Cullen is a wonderful writer who selects her words carefully, unfurls masterful dialogue, and presents scenes in authentic detail.  The reader is transported into a past era of careful comportment, respectful relationships, and courteous interactions.  Mark Twain was not, however, particular about being socially acceptable and was loud, abusive, and self-absorbed.  His popularity was gained because of his remarkable storytelling ability and his imposing charisma.  Close family members and staffers were more aware of his shortcomings because he was less careful about congeniality when around them.There was a tangled relationship between Twain and Lyon and, in later tears, his business manager, Ralph Ashcroft, whom Lyon eventually married.  Another love triangle between Helen Keller, her teacher Anne Sullivan Macy, and Anne’s husband, John Macy, is chronicled, as well as Twain’s interest in Keller and his well-known propensity for young girls and pretty women.  Cullen has carefully explored this lusty life in discreet language based on Isabel Lyon’s expansive diary, Twain’s writings, his letters, and hundreds of books by or about the legendary writer.Lyon died in 1956 at age 94 in New York City, never having commented on Twain’s allegations against her nor the circumstances that so enraged him.  It’s obvious that Cullen feels a strong empathy for Lyons’ story, although it’s never so stated in “Twains End.”Cullen’s portrayal of Twain somewhat denigrates his persona of a likeable bon vivant.  However, because his works are such excellent examples of writing well done, I’ll continue reading them.  I’ll also read more of Lynn Cullen because her careful explorations of human frailty are non judgmental and beautifully presented, with interesting subject matter.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDRM8KCPDCYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476758964#wasThisHelpful","R3EDRM8KCPDCYL","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BROTHER REVIEWAnia Ahlborn is a well-known writer of horror fiction, and “Brother,” her latest story, continues her streak of horrifying novels that delve deep into the world of nightmarish ugliness.  She’s a resident of Portland, Oregon.  Could that contribute to her weirdness?Deep in the woods of Appalachia there is rumored to be people with malicious minds and horrible life practices.  In “Brother,” we meet the Morrow family that has a penchant for murdering young girls who have wandered into their domain and, if eliminated, will never be missed.  Michael, a nineteen-year-old, adopted some ten years earlier by the family, does not carry the ingrained familial bloodlust exhibited by the other members and is looking for an escape.  His adopted brother isn’t about to let that happen and finds ways to keep Michael involved in the family carnage sprees, even expanding his duties to more and more fiendish chores.The author has had a somewhat unusual childhood herself, spending a lot of time in a cemetery, rearranging flowers to make a more equitable distribution among the graves.  Who knows if this penchant has led to strange thoughts, but Ahlborn certainly has a morbid imagination that she likes to share.  Her book will have strong appeal for those who appreciate ghoulish stories and murderous escapades.  Her writing is exceptional if somewhat disturbing.Who is Ania Ahlborn?  I’ve read quite a few of her blogs and find a thoughtful, intelligent wordsmith who decries those writers who publish work that is not particularly good because of their need for speed.  Their editing is dismal or often nonexistent.  Not so with her releases.  I relish her dedication to good writing and the joy it brings to my ever-searching eyes.That said, I don’t find Ahlborn’s storyline to be easily believed.  I doubt there exists any family with the Morrows’ unmitigated lust for psychopathic behavior involving brutal murder, dismemberment, and cannibalism.  To get away with this behavior for so many years, even in the backwoods of West Virginia, seems illogical.But I’ve always said that a writer gets to fantasize and write about anything without worrying that the words will be scrutinized for credibility.  The only standard to be met is the entertainment of the reader, and there are certainly those who enjoy this type of story.  Strangely enough, I found myself being drawn into this evil environment to the point that I was actually entertained by the bloody behavior.  Hopefully, when I return to my more sedate reading material, I will not have been traumatized.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FLZUQCUC118/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WZBG#wasThisHelpful","R30FLZUQCUC118","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jen Mann, author of “People I Want to Punch in the Throat,” is a piece of work.  Yes, she is opinionated.  Yes, she is self-centered.  Yes, she is profane.  Yes, she would be the wrong person to cross.  And, yes, she is funny.Who are all these people she wants to punch out?  They’re preschool mothers and their obnoxious spawn.  They’re office mates with devious lifestyles.  They’re camp followers and their obsessive drive to get the best for their developing prodigies.  They’re pretentious people, pesky telemarketers, nosy neighbors, overprotective parents, and, well, pretty much anyone who gets crossways with the author’s frame of mind.  If I was her husband, Hubs, I’d wear a spiked dog collar at all times because he is always asking for a throat chop.Here’s the thing about Jen Mann.  Her outlook, while crusty, is hilarious and runs completely parallel with mine.  The annoying people she describes are the same people I run across…irritating and completely unworthy of occupying space in a civilized society.  They don’t have a clue about their idiotic behavior and tend to denigrate those who can’t understand their attitude.  I don’t know if she really confronts them as forcefully as she describes, but I’m sure they get the point she is making.  I suspect she’s also a nicer person than she lets on.She is profane and has a “don’t give a s**t” attitude.  She’s comfortable with that persona and just as at ease if you choose to not read her book because it offends you.  But you will miss a lot of sensible reflections and opinions, and, for sure, will miss a lot of outstanding humor.  There are two things I don’t get because they’re not explained.  How did Hubs get that nickname?  Is he the center of her universe or does everything revolve around him?  Based on her description, I don’t think so.  And what are her children’s real names? Mann says they are worse than Gomer and Adolpha, the names assigned to them in her book.  If so, I’d like to know what they are.This is an entertaining book.  Don’t get turned off by the language that is more humorous than obscene.  Loosen up a little and let some else’s miseries wash over you.  It’s a warm, languid bath that summons up a nice glass of pinot gris.  Under those conditions a grin would seem appropriate.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDZTZVR23RFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034554983X#wasThisHelpful","R2UDZTZVR23RFE","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GIRL WITH TWO NAMES REVIEW“The Girl with Two Names is an interesting book with a different storyline that wavers between strongly appealing and disconcertingly amateurish.  There’s no doubt that the author, Gerard O’Neill, is talented but he needs to pay more attention to little details such as creating more realistic dialogue and doing a better job of editing.I received a gratis copy of the book from the author and because it’s marked 2nd edition I’m assuming it’s not a pre-publication proof.  That allows me to be critical of the editing that is less than professional and that disturbed my reading cadence.  Just as I was starting to marvel at some great scene setting, along would come double wording, bad grammar, atrocious punctuation, and gaps in the typography that definitely affected my rating of the book.A Japanese rock star, either Yayoi or Yaya, depending on your preference, struggles with an unhappy marriage and the professional demands on her time.  She makes a break for it, escaping to New Zealand, where she gets involved with Bill and other New Zealanders who like their outdoor adventures accented with scraggly life.  She attempts to fit into the environment, struggling with the inconveniences, until her husband finds her and begins a campaign of intimidation and violence as he attempts to win her back.  The later pages of the book are filled with beatings and shootings and shenanigans that threaten her and those unfortunate enough to be around her.  It gets a bit complicated.I didn’t much care for Yayoi, finding her to be weak willed and self absorbed.  The author attempted to present her as an endearing and sweet waif who was searching for her big-girl persona but it didn’t work for me.  I finished the book mostly out of curiosity created by the author’s story.  But, in reality, I didn’t much care about how Yayoi fared in her big adventure.One thing I took from the book was O’Neill’s love for writing.  It was a well-intentioned attempt at getting his words into a book and I applaud that.  Hopefully I don’t discourage his continued efforts at becoming a first-rate author that I’m sure will happen with more experience.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO4P9YYYZ9U0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01023C8XQ#wasThisHelpful","RO4P9YYYZ9U0Z","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DARK STAR SAFARI REVIEWPaul Theroux, author of “Dark Star Safari,” is many things to many people but, above all, he is prolific, having written over fifty books of both fiction and nonfiction: he also writes essays and criticisms; edits anthologies; and produces articles for many publications.  Most of his work is produced while rambling around the world in less than luxurious circumstances, so travel writer is also an appropriate title.As a person, he casts an aura of crustiness, sarcastic humor, and a deep feeling for the human condition.  He’s willing to get grungy, sleep in filth, and eat gross things. He’s not shy, somewhat a loner, and fearless in his search for intriguing stories.  He is a glorious writer with a vocabulary that is outer-space huge.  His choice of words is intimidating to most readers who should always include a dictionary at their chair side when starting one of his books.“Dark Star Safari,” written in 2003, is his opus dedicated to the mysteries and lore of Africa.  He deeply studies it in all its wrenching poverty, political turmoil, and volatile temperament and presents its intricate face and scabby underbelly to those with patience and a love for detail.The reader will travel the nearly 5,000 miles from Cairo to Cape Town by ratty bus, nasty cattle truck, bug-infested dugout canoe, clanking train, and derelict boat.  The food is gross, the beds are dirty, the natives are uneasy, and death from bandits is always close at hand. But Theroux, in his unflinching pursuit of reportable events, drags us with him through the dirt, mosquitoes, and bullets.  It seems he knows almost every person in Africa, and those he doesn’t he approaches without trepidation to grill them for information.  Sometimes he hits a nerve but he never reports that he’s been beaten or thrown in jail for his audacious manner.  Hopefully that never comes.“Dark Star Safari” is a lengthy read.  The author is thorough in his reporting, frequently inflicting self-castigation for his wordiness.  I spend a lot of time looking up words because I am curious as to their meaning, only to think why does he not just say it another way so we common folk could understand it.  But, of course, Theroux is not common folk.  He is an intellectual who allows obscure words roll off his pen as a matter of course.  Actually it’s beautiful to see.When you finish this book you will be proud of yourself and feel more knowledgeable.  These are fascinating stories that are beautifully put together.  This is the reason why we read Theroux in the first place.  Whether you want it or not, Africa will become a much more familiar place.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173AN3N3P64GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618446877#wasThisHelpful","R173AN3N3P64GX","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO PARADISE REVIEWIn “A Beginners Guide to Paradise” author Alex Sheshunoff has concocted a stew of silliness, cultural enlightenment, and travel tips that is both entertaining and somewhat disorganized.  We have the story of a dissatisfied American male seeking happiness in faraway places but who has no idea what it is that he wants.  So he leads the reader into his world of thrashing around in the remote areas of Micronesia among the topless and casual natives, trying to find his footing.He hooks up with Sarah, another American and better grounded individual, who takes a firm grip on his restlessness, steers him towards a more productive existence, and eventually becomes a wife and mother whom he credits with making his life “immeasurably more full of wonder and possibility and humor and plain old-fashioned love than I ever knew was possible.”  So we know that his wandering nature ended up in a good place.I find that his writing is complex, full of wit and humor, and amazingly erudite in his observations about cultural complexities and the behavior of the indigenous people of remote Pacific islands.  Sometimes the distance between wacky behavior and cultural dissertation gets too intimate in his writing but that’s the way Sheshunoff operates in both in his thinking and lifestyle.  The humor is rampant in the beginning of the book and seems to give way to more education as the book goes along, but overall it is very engaging.The author’s command of language is very good and his scenic descriptions are outstanding.  One can feel the heat and humidity, the oppressive lushness of the tropics, and the constant presence of the ocean.  This is not a travelogue that is intended to lure tourists to Yap or Anguar or Palau, but it is a realistic look at a place, normally considered a paradise, that requires some acclimatization.Sheshunoff offers some things that can be attained by giving up everything in your life; moving to a South Pacific island, wearing a loin cloth, reading a hundred books, building a bungalow, diapering a baby monkey, and maybe falling in love.  If these come close to matching your goals in life, you should read this book.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSK900525VFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475860#wasThisHelpful","R2FSK900525VFQ","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IN A DARK, DARK WOOD REVIEWRuth Ware, English author of “In a Dark, Dark Wood,” has prepared a thriller for readers in her debut novel.Mystery novelist Leonora lives a regimented but content life in London.  She gets up, has coffee, goes for a run, takes a shower, and starts writing.  Apart from having an internal conflict about her name, she’s known as Nora or Lee, depending on who is talking to her, she is content and well settled.  Then an email changes her life by recalling old friends that are not necessarily good friends, and that invites her to a hen weekend for Claire, a childhood friend she hasn’t seen for ten years.Her inclination is to decline but some intense urging by a mutual friend, Nora, changes her mind and she finds herself in a strange house in a remote dark woods with people she’d rather not be hanging around with.  Instability, backstabbing, snarkiness, and sinister behavior give way to terror and murder, eventually making the party a nightmare.  Ware has developed a story with twists that would make Agatha Christie proud, and a reading experience that is spellbinding.  Needless to say, reading it is the only way you’ll learn its secrets.Nora is a control freak and finds herself in circumstances over which she has no control.  That, and the bizarre behavior of each attendee, allows the author to keep the reader unnerved as the story develops.  Dark humor is interspersed at appropriate intervals, but in such a manner as to not destroy the mood.  The structuring is believable, the dialogue crackles, and the stygian landscape makes for a mysterious setting.  Even the author admits to having the weird characters still running through her mind, spoiling her attempts to start a new book.This is a different read for me in that females dominate the story.  The author and the characters, including a gay man, would probably qualify this as chick lit but I was totally immersed in the story and never thought of it that way.  It is simply a great suspense tale that should not be denigrated as having a female slant.  Of course a hen party before a wedding is a feminine tradition, but the acrimony and past associations that are revealed at the gathering are universally human when early years are remembered.This is a wonderful book and an exciting read for mystery fans.  Ware, although personally not a fan of overly sadistic or violent writing, manages to insert just enough carnage to make sure the story keeps its suspenseful grip on the reader.  I recommend “In a Dark, Dark Wood” as a thriller worth reading.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXBWJB3R9OHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501112317#wasThisHelpful","R2PXBWJB3R9OHO","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE OREGON TRAIL REVIEWRinker Buck and his younger brother, Nick, both alcoholics with spotty lifestyles, discover their identities in “The Oregon Trail,” spending four months looking at the rear ends of three intrepid mules from a jarring wagon seat.  Whatever their past, they are instant heroes of the indolent for their modern-day adventure.Buck is consumed by fervor to travel 2,000 miles on the famed route that settled the West and he wants to suffer the same discomforts experienced by gritty settlers in the middle 1800s.  He calls it a “crazyass passion.”Under a heavy cloud of pessimism, he consents to having his brother join him.  Nick is an experienced team driver, mechanic, and animal handler who will provide needed expertise to Rink, who is better suited to giving orders and planning daily events.  Rink is instantly installed as Wagon Master and Nick becomes Top Hand. The decision to include Nick is easily big brother’s best.Together they fight equipment breakdowns, sand storms, torrential rains, and runaway mules.  They subsist on huge quantities of chili, without beans.  Heat, grease, and grime surround them.  When route uncertainties plague the Wagon Master, Top Hand just plods along, certain they will get somewhere.Rinker sleeps in the built-in bed in the tarp-covered wagon, while Nick, and his eternally greasy Jack Russell terrier, Olive Oyl, bed under the wagon and in leaky barns, often in manure, without complaint.  This is a four-month long journey and, yes, I said without complaint.We come to love Rink and Nick by the end of the trip. We get even more emotionally involved with three mules; the unpredictable Beck, the unmotivated Bute, and Jake, the gentle giant.  Their individual shortcomings disappear when the hauling begins, and Buck captures their personalities and chronicles how the two men develop great love their long-eared buddies.  The cadence for “calling the team,” urging them to carry on under horrible strain, is lyrical in Buck’s book.This is a great adventure that melds historical information with today’s journey into an unforgettable memoir.  The book is wordy, to be sure, but each one is important to the story.  It all comes together into a highly entertaining read; one you shouldn’t miss.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NB1XVHCU52XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R2NB1XVHCU52XB","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IMPOSTERS OF PATRIOTISM REVIEWTed Richardson has presented an outstanding book in his debut writing endeavor, “Imposters of Patriotism.”  He has imagined that our leading patriot, George Washington, was forced to offer a surrender to the British during the Revolutionary War because of the dire conditions that Americans were being forced to endure.  The horrible conditions did actually exist, the British forces were about to overwhelm the colonists, and Washington was desperate to find solutions to the problems he faced.  But there is no evidence Washington ever considered surrendering.  In Richardson’s novel the surrender offer was actually written by Washington, sent via a trusted courier, but not delivered.  Washington believed the undelivered letter was burned per his instructions to the courier who, for whatever reason, disobeyed the order.  The letter disappeared for a couple of hundred years.The story moves to modern times when an antique dealer, Matt Hawkins finds a journal in which the letter is disclosed.  Knowing the impact such an act would have on the legacy of George Washington, Hawkins becomes obsessed with finding the actual letter to allay any concerns that might sully the reputation of the first President of the United States.  He believes the letter should be found and disclosed, being certain that it is an important historical event, and that George Washington’s reputation and the conditions that prompted the offer would overcome any negative public reaction.Unfortunately unscrupulous politicians and their equally nefarious promoters have a different view.  The Republican nominee for President in an approaching election is a direct descendant of Washington, bears his name, and is shamelessly exploiting the father of our country in his campaign.  The tactic has worked and he has steadily risen in the polls.  He also has a hidden hedge fund involving huge amounts of money that he will be able to enhance by presidential edict after he wins the election.  Fearing that Washington will be become a pariah for even considering a surrender and the public fallout will damage his campaign, costing him billions of dollars.  He and his vicious advisors are frantic to make sure the letter disappears into the dark morass of historical secrets.Richardson’s idea is intriguing.  He has done his research and his writing stirs the imagination.  He presents it so well that one has to think it might really have happened.  Of course, the way things have turned out in the real world, we know the delivery was never made--think what our world might be had we not won our war for independence.  The author has combined a realistic historical possibility with a modern detective drama and come up with a very enjoyable and thought-provoking read.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4M891SKBE2RS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5MHEUQ#wasThisHelpful","R4M891SKBE2RS","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MADELEINE’S KISS REVIEWMost avid readers that I know can’t really express what it is they like or don’t like about a book.  “Madeleine’s Kiss” by Peter Gilboy first created that indecision in me.  But, in the end, I have decided that the story, although highly unlikely, is a good read and definitely worth my time.The concept is very unusual.  An unmotivated professor of art history is the narrator and tells his story of an infatuated experience with a comely young girl who is operating out of a leaky boat.  This is an unlikely liaison because of the differences in their lifestyle.  Why would an academic man fall so heavily for a flighty and slightly scary backwoods denizen?  He tells us in his narrative that a sexual encounter is not foremost in his mind, but we are left wondering exactly what it is that has ensnared him.  In fact, he tells us more than that.  He lets us in on his own sketchy behavior before his meeting up with Madeleine.The runaway from Appalachia sees things, hears things, and says things that would scare the crap out of a normal person.  Yet the good professor continues to get deeper and deeper into their relationship to the point he is now being prosecuted for her murder.He brings up many questions.  Is he a past abuser of women?  Does his consorting with this disturbed young woman make him a likely suspect in her disappearance?  Are his repeated denials of committing abuse or of having a sexual connection with this girl reliable?  His past history and all the evidence of his escapades with Madeleine (is that really her name?) would seem to indicate that he also operates a boat with holes in it.Peter Gilboy is a former university professor, intelligence officer, truck driver, bartender, and short-order cook.  He drew from his experience in all these ventures in the writing of “Madeleine’s Kiss.”  He has a couple of other novels that are themed the same as “Kiss,” psychological dramas that feature sexual drama and lots of questions about personal behavior.  He is a strong writer, good with grammar, and able to develop his story in such a manner that the reader may feel that he or she has the storyline under control.  But the surprises keep coming and the results usually surprise the smug.I liked this book and will be reading more of Peter Gilboy.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MYLWJGAKP0BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2DA4LG#wasThisHelpful","R1MYLWJGAKP0BU","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CIRCLING THE SUN REVIEWPaula McLain is a polite writer who doesn’t dish the dirt on the subjects of her historical novels.  In “The Paris Wife,” her study of the early years of marriage between Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, she was very kind about Hemingway’s personality and behavior, and almost forgot about Richardson’s chronic alcoholism that plagued her in later years.  In my opinion, for some reason, their lifestyle among the “Lost Generation” in Paris was not realistically dealt with.And so it is in “Circling the Sun,” McLain’s historical novel about Beryl Markham, renowned as the first woman horse trainer in Africa, owner of numerous horses that won championships all over The Dark Continent, and first aviatrix to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo East to West.  She could ride and shoot like a man and threw a better spear than most of her male African counterparts.  She could also run faster and leap higher than them.  But the book, written in the first person as though Markham is telling her own story, doesn’t really let us see the other woman who had countless affairs, bedded Prince Henry, son of King George V and Queen Mary, and accepted a trust fund pay-off to stay away from the prince.  She also sponged off her friends when her funds ran low, and was, as Ernest Hemingway described her, ... “to my knowledge very unpleasant and we might even say a high-grade bitch, (but she) can write rings around all of us…” Yes, she was also a writer, although that has also been disputed over the years.Many famous people of that period appear in McLain’s book including a fascinating love triangle involving Karen Blixen, who later wrote “Out of Africa” as Isak Dinesen, her lover Denys Finch Hatten, and Markham.  The author doesn’t describe anger, jealousy, or reprisal to the trio, and only a little betrayal.  In real life, syphilis was in the area but seemingly not a barrier to their shenanigans, and also not reported by McLain.The author also chose to be stingy on details about Markham’s flying skills, how she attained them, and about her voyage across the Atlantic.  Only a small portion at the end of the book even mentions it.  Some have said Markham’s struggle in the darkness of the mid-Atlantic to keep her engines running is the most terrifying flying experience ever described.So McLain soft-pedals the shortcomings and some of the glories of her subjects.  She is actually a first-rate writer who tells a compelling story, describes the beauties of Africa in glorious language, and brings us great heights of entertainment not normally reached by lesser scribes.

"RENALDO REVIEW“Renaldo” is an intriguing book in which the author, James McCreath, has jammed a lot of stuff, and I don’t mean ‘stuff’ in a demeaning manner.  He has literally packed his book with seemingly disparate events, i.e. romance, terrorism, global soccer, politics, and history.  It all seems overwhelming until you begin reading and the carefully researched topics all fall into place, becoming important to the overall story.The storyline itself is simple.  A talented, affluent Argentian teenager, Renaldo De Seta, saves the life of a wealthy lawyer, Astor Gordero, who wields tremendous influence in all aspects of soccer and politics in Argentina.  As a reward, Renaldo is given a chance to try out for Argentina’s World Cup soccer team.  Renaldo becomes an idol after getting involved in rough-and-tumble team hazing and proving his worth in preliminary matches.  His older brother, Lonfranco De Seta, himself a talented and affable person, slowly descends into a world of dissatisfaction with the government and gets involved with terrorism and murder.And then there are the women, and a delectable bunch they are.  Symca, the most popular singing sexpot in Argentina, and fantasy object of every man, turns Renaldo from a shy and virginal boy into a lustful time bomb.  She is replaced by Englishwoman Mallory, who wants Renaldo on her soccer team and in her bed.  And there’s Celeste, a violent terrorist who knows how to manipulate Lonfranco into her personal instrument of radicalism; a dangerous liaison if there ever was one.It’s a very good story, if somewhat overwritten in spots.  McCreath writes riveting soccer action scenes. At times his dialogue vacillates from flowery to overblown but is very well done in most instances.  I believe he should try to be more consistent in his verbal exchanges.  The ending is somewhat vanilla as compared to the rest of the story.Soccer, unlike some American sports, has staggering international appeal that continues to grow.  Over 240 million players are registered with FIFA worldwide and billions of fans are maniacal in their support.  Its website is recording over 2 billion viewers worldwide, far outdistancing any other sports website.Despite the popular uproar about the sport, very little worthwhile adult soccer fiction has been written.  This becomes an interesting read because McCreath has done the research necessary to bring realism and timeliness to his story.  I found it enjoyable and very informative.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CBC5M2BT6JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P5GKGC#wasThisHelpful","R9CBC5M2BT6JJ","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BAREFOOT LAWYER REVIEWImagine wending your way through your house and yard then down the street to your mailbox in total darkness.  There would be the usual impediments along the way; furniture, doorways, planters, gates, garden hoses, cars, curbs, trashcans.  You could not see them.In “The Barefoot Lawyer,” author Chen Guangcheng describes a much more dangerous passage.  Totally blind since an infant, Chen had to negotiate the backyards of his poor Chinese neighborhood, through gates, over walls, and through goat pens as he made a desperate attempt to escape his captors who were holding him under house arrest.  A civil rights activist in modern China, Chen, after being released from four years in prison, had been subjected to two years of brutal confinement in his tiny house.  He needed to escape and subsequently get his family to safety.It took eight hours to negotiate the first 100 feet.  Along the way, he broke an ankle, sent a herd of goats into a braying frenzy, caused an mentally ill adult to break into a screaming fit for his mother, but somehow escaped detection from some twenty four guards who were specifically deployed to keep an eye on him.  Several days later he turned up at the American embassy in Beijing, dehydrated, hungry, and filthy dirty.Chen’s memoir is an illuminating account of animosity towards China’s system of oppressive government that features brutality, oppression, and total disregard for human dignity.  Today he is an important voice for human rights in China and the amazing story of his flight to freedom will stir the heart and soul of every person who reads this saga.There is much to learn in the book about the oppressive and inhumane policies in China.  It is also a mesmerizing account of the handicap of being blind and the struggle to exist in a world of darkness, misunderstanding, and harassment, every day occurrences for those who cannot see.Another shocker is that after escaping the clutches of a brutal government, Chen found that his safe haven of democracy, freedom, and human rights advocacy was, in fact, a nest of United States officials who were prone to giving in to China’s demands.  In his book Chen is careful to thank the Americans for their shelter, but is still troubled by their condescending partnership with his oppressors.It is difficult to imagine the world of the blind.  In a particularly beautiful passage in the book, Chen, as a young student, is asked to describe a waterfall.  Drawing from images in his mind, he describes it as “a screen of pearly beads,” a depiction that both enthralls his teacher and produces a tirade at the rest of the students who can’t describe something they can actually see.This is a good book that, along with uncovering the treacherous Chinese government, will make you more appreciative of the constant struggles of the blind.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390EGB64NUCHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805098054#wasThisHelpful","R390EGB64NUCHS","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CRUDE CARRIER REVIEWI find nothing about Rex Burns, author of “Crude Carrier,” having experience aboard any type of ship.  He mostly writes detective stories around the Denver area where he lives.  Burns has moved from his normal writing tendencies to the pitching deck, claustrophobic confines of an ocean-going transport vessel, and the complexities of petroleum commerce.  His knowledge and ability to write about on-board life aboard a crude oil ship is a radical change and indicates a devotion to intensive research.Howard Pease (1894-1974) is a legend for his tramp steamer adventures written for young adults in the mid 20th century.  As a young boy I was mesmerized by the sinister confines and intrigue found aboard freighters and still have every book he wrote in my library.  But Pease had much to draw on as he presented his wondrous stories because he lived the life of a crewman on this type of vessel.  I find Burns also has an authentic voice about adventures at sea, despite his lack of background, and I don’t find a false step in his writing.  Perhaps his background as a Marine Captain helped a bit.The details he describes about the workings, procedures, and life aboard a large vessel are enlightening.  His casual allusions about claustrophobia aboard a steel can on surging endless waters are realistic enough to bring shivers to my sensitive core.  My innards do not suffer confinement gladly.  There is also authenticity in his descriptions of the electronics the protagonist must maintain aboard the ship.  Again, I see dedication to research.Critics might point out that getting a job as third officer on a ship of this size with zero maritime experience is an unlikely event.  Also, to have the entire staff of command officers of a large-scale crude oil transport, including the Captain, be heavily involved in criminal activity including murder might be a stretch.  And the disappearance of millions of gallons of crude would likely raise a few more eyebrows than are lifted in the story.  But, as I have said many times, it’s the author’s book and he has license to write anything he feels comfortable with.  I enjoyed the novel and didn’t feel a bit hoodwinked by these developments.His use of a female sidekick is done with respect and careful consideration of the fact that sex does not have to be flaunted in every mystery story.  She is not a superwoman but adds an important element to the story.Burns writes in a terse and brawny style and his depictions are convincing and magnetic.  This is an entertaining and illuminating report on the transportation of crude oil and the corruption surrounding its commerce.  I enjoyed the book and heartily recommend it for an entertaining read.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor f TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDZ1LESI6TVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497641543#wasThisHelpful","R3KDZ1LESI6TVQ","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOLF WINTER REVIEW“Wolf Winter” is set in the dark and endless winter of northern Sweden under a foreboding mountain known as Blackasen.  The year is 1717, times are tough, and the populace is struggling with animus, poverty, and superstition.  When the dismembered body of a man is discovered in the wilderness, many strange theories surface about his demise.  Maija, a local woman, whose daughters find the body, is convinced that a murder has occurred, but her neighbors believe a bear or wolves killed and mauled the man.  And so a long and black tale of conflict begins, a twisting drama of betrayal, superstition, accusation, and sorcery.The author, Cecilia Ekback, has developed an interesting story as she sets Maija to the task of uncovering secrets being held by both the church and prominent leaders of the community.  Unfortunately, a good plot struggles because her storytelling skills come up short.  I was unable to get a strong feel for Maija’s resolve, couldn’t interpret the meaning of her thoughts or those of her witchlike daughter, and couldn’t account for the wicked behavior of church officials.  As the story progressed, these actions became more and more abstract to the point that I lost interest and struggled to finish the book.The expression “Wolf Winter” in Swedish (Vargavinter) refers to an unusually long and severe winter.  It is also used to describe the darkest time of a human’s life; literally taken as the wolves have eaten the sun.  With that sort of essence, this book has wonderfully chilling possibilities.  They don’t materialize, although I desperately wanted them to.  The author presents some great insight into ethnic distrust and superstitious ignorance, but fails to create a stirring story.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXNQLT1YOANE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8MGYW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXNQLT1YOANE","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE REVIEWAnthony Doerr is a celebrated writer whose first successes were with short stories.  He has added fiction, nonfiction, and memoirs to his repertoire, creating a short but notable list of credits.  The list of prizes he has won is impressive.  “All the Light We Cannot See” won the big one—the Pulitzer.  It is deserving.Two children of the 1940s, a blind French girl and a German boy prodigy, travel separate but converging paths during the last days of the Second World War and meet briefly as Germany nears defeat.  Their story is poignant, filled with individual terrors, and ends with a compassionate encounter amidst the rubble and horror of warThe girl, Marie Laure, blind from the age of six, lives with her father in Paris where he is master of the locks at the Museum of Natural History.  He builds her a scale model of their part of the city so the girl can navigate on her own with her feet and cane.  He hides a diamond of great value deep within it.  When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast where she ends up in her great uncle’s six-story narrow house, full of stairways, doors, and murky hidden spaces.  There she remains hidden with her treasure and uncle’s forbidden radio as the war rages around her.In Germany the boy, an orphan, displays a mastery for building and fixing radios, a skill that places him in a military academy noted for its selectivity and brutality where he ultimately becomes an expert tracker of Resistant partisans and their radio traffic.  His activities take him to Russia and eventually to Saint-Malo, where he discovers Marie-Laure living in her own dark world, hiding from the Germans and the war.Doerr is adept at intermingling the many lives that make up the story.  The Germans, French partisans, shopkeepers, scientists, and frightened residents are realistically depicted, their actions detailed. The book is lengthy but is so gloriously written that, aided by the writer’s use of spare language and brief chapters, time passes quickly.  The book has been criticized as being too simplistic, but I applaud the writing style that emphasizes clear narration and lyrical use of words.Factual background adds to the richness of Doerr’s writing.  Thescience of the mind, and matters of the heart are explored in the story but are so seamlessly inserted in the narrative they seem natural and unobtrusive.Doerr’s research into the diverse fields of radio, invertebrates, firearms, precious stones, and flora and fauna shows up in his expert discourses and accounts for the 10 years he needed to get this book written.  He reports that he wrote two additional books during the time he was putting together “All the Light.”I recommend this book as an illuminating look at a writer who is at the top of his game.  The skills of plotting, characterization, wording, and scenic description are on full display, creating a great reading experience.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKO5EPBOX76M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476746583#wasThisHelpful","RAKO5EPBOX76M","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN REVIEWPaula Hawkins has created a blockbuster in “The Girl on the Train.”  It’s a smash hit that tops every book-selling list.  Yet, when I read it, I wonder why all the adulation?  It’s a good book, somewhat suspenseful, but certainly not the masterpiece that earns such raves.It’s alternately narrated in the first person by three women who drag horribly overloaded baggage.  Rachel, Megan, and Anna and their men revolve around each other through sordid events that seemingly never end.  They exploit each other, betray each other, stalk each other, make love to each other, lie to each other, and then discard each other until they need each other again.  Oh, and there’s a masculine and dusky psychologist who enters the rumble and promptly forsakes the tenets imposed by his profession.  Somewhere in this sordid mix is a murderer, easily detected about halfway through.I find the crazy quilt of relationships too complicated to be believable.  The frame of mind the author assigns to each woman becomes eerily similar and not particularly of a sort to generate much sympathy.  The men seem to be irresolute and too self-involved to be able to handle the ladies and are inclined to be finding comfort in frequent quickies with each other’s mates.Yes, it’s a murder mystery but I can’t call it a thriller.  Without a compassionate feeling for the characters, I’m not terribly interested in their problems or the solutions.  I don‘t detect any aha moments and, with no probing and relentless detectives in the picture, I am ready to roll over and go to sleep.I know there are readers who enjoy simplicity in chill and thrill novels.  Immoral characters abound in novels these days and writers get rich by detailing their wanton ways.  But I need more depth, more realism, and more suspense.  Hawkins has a way with the weather in England.  The gloomy, wet, and picturesque landscape populated by taciturn Britishers who love their dismal pubs is well represented in her descriptive writing.  But a stunning story isn’t present for me.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZILYC7974VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633665#wasThisHelpful","REZILYC7974VS","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IT’S A LONG STORY REVIEWMy image of Willie Nelson goes like this; a grizzled little guy standing at a microphone, singing with a nasally twang and picking the crap out of an old, banged up guitar with a hole in it.  Then, from the backdrop of a wrinkled t-shirt and pigtails comes fascinating music with bewitching phrasing and impeccable rhythm.  When you say “Willie Nelson” to others, they chuckle at the image until the music starts.  Then his quivering voice and nimble fingers become captivating.The correct way to envision Willie is as a wondrous performer and songwriter who doesn’t give a fig about what people think of him, how he lives, or how they see him.  Once the scruffy image disappears, admiration moves in.  Should I be concerned about being critical about Willie’s first impression?  I don’t think so.  It’s been carefully cultivated and embraced, and Willie will be the first to tell you he doesn’t care what you think.“It’s a Long Story” shows that, along with his musicality, he’s also a good writer.  He expresses his feelings about his music and memories clearly and with feeling.  As he puts it, this book is the story of a song picker from Texas who has managed his stormy nights and sun-filled days by “staying close to the music of my heart.”  It’s a song he wants to sing to you, the reader.He is profane, opinionated, and full of spunk but his writing is as lyrical and captivating as his songs and the melodies he wraps around them.  To read him is to hear his musicality.  His words are sometimes hard to digest because of the habits he embraces, but there’s no questioning the intensity of his desire to bring his song to the world, wrinkles and all.His life of carousing, drinking, and smoking weed isn’t relevant to his music or his writing.  It’s all part of being Willie, of getting him to his work, of quieting his world to allow the words and music to flow.Willie surrounds himself with family and friends and exalts in their company.  His cronies in the music world, many with his same attitude about life, are all here and get outed about their habits to some extent.  But the indifference to other people’s opinion about their life style seems universal.  To me that’s okay because I’ve come to the same place myself.This book will be enjoyed by music lovers because of its honesty and because of the prurient details about living a rambling life with no guilt.  Willie’s freewheeling life has brought alternating periods of joy and murkiness but his euphoria about life in general has allowed him to overcome the obstacles.  There are many lessons to learn here for a receptive reader with an open mind.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IFVXNUB446HS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316403555#wasThisHelpful","R2IFVXNUB446HS","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THINGS THAT MATTER REVIEWIt would be a good idea to have a dictionary handy while reading Dr. Krauthammer’s collection of insightful observations, “Things That Matter.”  The erudite author is clearly dedicated to plain speak but occasionally, like a body tic, he throws in a word that makes me fumble for Webster’s definitions.  Sometimes even that doesn’t help.I’m okay with that because I feel so much more intelligent after I read his material.  I even understand and applaud most of it.  I know.  I’m showing my conservative underwear.  But if you really concentrate on his ideas about civility, political foolishness, scientific and medical wonders, man and God, the Jewish question, terrorism, and life’s oddities, you will find much with which to agree.Along with his common-sense look at all things we encounter, he displays a jovial sense of humor and an appreciation of nonsensical happenings that enlivens his writing.He writes in defense of the F-word.  He makes fun of the American tendency towards arrogance.  He embraces the joy of losing with his devotion to the Washington Nationals.  He considers it a slow news day when the naming of the President’s dog is the leading topic of media conversation.So, you see, he is not all egg headed and solemn.  There’s twisted and whacky material in that splendid brain.Dr. Krauthammer is a magnificent thinker and writer.  It’s one thing to have a mind that can comprehend a myriad of complex issues and quite another to be able to explain them to a normal person.  Many geniuses of the world labor in obscurity because of this shortcoming.  Not so with this wise man and gifted communicator.Charles Krauthammer doesn’t have to go away when you close the book.  He writes a weekly column for a Washington D.C. newspaper that should be a must read if you are a fan.  He’s also a frequent contributor to a major TV network.  He has to be considered a national treasure regardless of your personal political leanings and this book is a tribute to his clearheaded thinking.

"NOTHING DAUNTED REVIEWThe author of “Nothing Daunted,” Dorothy Wickendon, is the most fortunate of biographers.  She had a treasure trove of letters, news clippings, and family remembrances on which to develop her story.  Historical researchers and writers are ecstatic when finding such abundant material.Her grandmother. Dorothy Woodruff, and close friend of eighty-three years, Rosamond Underwood, will be two of the most likable and adventurous women the reader will ever meet.  In their late twenties, with open spirits and inquisitive minds, the two ladies signed on to be teachers in the remote high country of Colorado.  They knew nothing of being a teacher or of subsisting in a turbulent environment, but overcame all the hurdles with their eager and resolute attitude.The amazing thing about their comments is the absence of complaints or odious remarks about anything or anybody they encounter.  It’s almost Pollyannaish in its reading, yet refreshing and delightful in our contemporary world of distasteful literary efforts.Dorothy’s letters are filled with insight and amusing anecdotes.  I squirmed when reading of the flea infestation found in the straw flooring of Parisian carriages.  And I understand her perplexed look at Matisse paintings.  She was opinionated and set in her ways, but in an agreeable and down-to-earth manner.There are interesting glimpses at Isadora Duncan, Nijinsky, and Agnes de Mille, who, as a thirty-year-old dance instructor, wanted to see a real square dance.  She came to Elkhead, witnessed and joined in the locals’ dance, and ended up in the sagebrush when she was pitched through the door at the end of a “crack the whip” step.  Seven years later she danced the lead in her ballet, “Rodeo,” to Aaron Copeland’s rousing score, crediting her trip to Elkhead as the inspiration.There’s not a disagreeable character in story.  Perhaps the most intriguing is Ferry Carpenter, a local lawyer, who hires the two women and becomes their guardian angel.  He is about their age, kind and solicitous, and I sense a romantic entanglement never acted upon until Ros marries him after the death of her husband many years later.This book is an uplifting look at the goodness in people, not only in Dorothy and Ros, but also in the people they encounter.  That feeling of benevolence is extended to the author as she interviews the expanded group of family members from the early days of Elkhead, Hayden, and Oak Creek.  Wickendon’s gift for language, passion for research, and painstaking construction of complex relationships will fascinate you.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UPMALP5A1NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439176590#wasThisHelpful","R34UPMALP5A1NP","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GREEN DOLPHIN STREET REVIEWI first read “Green Dolphin Street” when I was about fourteen, motivated, no doubt, by the 1947 movie that featured exciting scenes of sailing, New Zealand, earthquakes, tidal waves, wild weather, natives, and swashbuckling adventure.  The fact that it starred Lana Turner and Donna Reed was surely a factor because of their luminous beauty that scratched the libido of a teen aged boy.I remember the read as a good one, although, as I grind through it now, it seems stodgy, overwritten, and full of sermonizing.  That’s normal for Elizabeth Goudge (1900-1984) who was known to be very religious and painstakingly deliberate in her writing.  The story of two siblings, an adventurer fond of drink, a rough-hewn lumber man, a glorious clipper ship with it’s heroic captain, a glorious country filled with cannibals, and romance that borders on sappy is the makeup of Goudge’s story.  My copy is very old with dog-eared pages and a strong mildewy smell.  Possibly that has shaped my opinion.I haven’t found much on Goudge’s background but there has been no indication that she ever visited or researched New Zealand.  That makes for some question as to the authenticity of her setting.  I’m a stickler for authenticity.  She was, however, a prolific writer, and is still highly regarded, a standing that enhances her believability.I recommend this book for romantics who like a touch of adventure, distantly in the style of Bronte or Austen.  Goudge should be admired for her strong characterizations and scenic descriptions.  Some of her writing is beautifully wrought with exhilarating  accounts of weather and ocean.The book is lengthy with small type, making it a drudge to read.  But if historical romance is your primary reading preference, “Green Dolphin Street” might be for you.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQK97SI9KB6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVCAIG#wasThisHelpful","R1FQK97SI9KB6U","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SILENT CREED REVIEWThis is my first reading of Alex Kava and the expertise she shows at plotting a crime story is a strong indicator of why she has so many books published in the genre.  In “Silent Creed” she combines the exploits of expert dog handler, former marine Ryder Creed, with an FBI forensics’ expert, Maggie O’Dell, already an iconic Kava character.  This is their second adventure together and probably more are on the way.Creed is deployed to North Carolina with his dogs to sniff out victims in a monstrous landslide.  There he finds O’Dell, a former colleague (and perhaps more), who is assigned to prowl around in her role as FBI agent because some of the bodies found have been murdered.  Somewhere under all the trees, rocks, and mud is a secret government research lab where clandestine experiments have politicians and military big wigs nervous about what might be discovered in the rubble.  That’s about it for the plot.Of interest is the way Kava lets us follow the dogs, by far the most interesting of all her characters.  They are brave, talented, and lovable.  The humans could be imbued with some of these traits to make them a little more engaging as well.  Creed spends most of his time trying to recuperate from numerous injuries and O’Dell is a hardback with mostly negative feelings towards other people.  The author seems determined to make them either unlikeable or maladroit, although they seem to strike a favorable chord with some readers.Kava’s writing is straightforward and not focused on major thought-bending ruminations on the part of the characters.  The story is clearly written and the plot line well developed.  There are many flashbacks that add some level of confusion, but mostly the book proceeds in an orderly fashion and gets down to business.The author has researched her dog information and is well versed in animal behavior and handling techniques.  This makes for dogs we all can love.The book ends with obvious clues that something more is coming.  As prolific as Kava is, we will, no doubt, see more of the dogs and of her signature characters.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEV52O2X9INU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170774#wasThisHelpful","R2UEV52O2X9INU","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BACKYARD REVIEWNorman Draper, author of “Backyard,” from what I can learn, is about as eccentric and free-spirited as the characters he brings to life in this delightfully whacky book.  He’s a long time journalist with an impressive list of publications to his credit, none of which we’ve ever heard of.  I suggest that “Backyard” will provide the impetus for a more notable writing career.A small upper mid-west town is populated with a mélange of characters who demonstrate their many quirks with impetuous and outlandish behavior.  The most prominent conduct concerns their interest in gardening where egos, presumptiveness, jealousy, and greed are the byproducts.  When a local nursery introduces a gardening contest with a huge first prize, the horns come out and widespread goring takes place.There is a self-declared expert with a mail-order doctorate in gardening who will stop at nothing to get her hands on the cash.  There is a middle-aged couple who enjoys the beauty and notoriety of their backyard through wine-tinted eyes and over-indulgent spending that threatens their retirement savings.  There’s a garden witch, a quivering sycophant who fawns over garden expertise, and other assorted characters that will all come together in a riotous encounter where a knife, a tomahawk, and a baseball bat become weapons of hilarity.The contest winner and circumstances surrounding the decision shall remain a secret that you can solve by reading the book.Draper’s characterizations are masterfully constructed and I defy the reader to not recognize any of the figures as being family or friends.  Painful or not, these people have been around us many times.Draper does a remarkable job at producing silliness and pomposity as a way of life.  His insight into human frailty is clever and well presented, and his dialogue fits right into the merriment.  This is a great book, ready made for book clubs, and enjoyable reading.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A84RBWT8O1TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617733059#wasThisHelpful","R1A84RBWT8O1TW","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE DINNER REVIEW“The Dinner” is a bewildering book.  It’s full of opinions, odd reactions, pomposity, family communion and dysfunction, and decisions that promote reflective musings.  It’s a disturbing story filled with dark undertones and reminders of parental obsession with the protection of their young.  In some ways it’s a little over the top.The writer, Howard Koch, assaults the reader’s sensitivity as he explores this primeval impulse of protection.  Koch explains that the narrator, Paul, in the process of protecting his child, is hiding something from himself as well.  He is unable to control his emotions and his response to those who displease him is to deal out physical punishment.  That influences his thinking.His brother, Serge, is a pompous egoist who revels in his own importance.  The fact he might be the Netherlands next prime minister weighs heavily on his mind.  There is constant tension between the two brothers, a failed teacher and a political big wig.They decide to have dinner with their wives to discuss the behavior of their two sons who have committed a heinous act.  The meal evolves into an affair of roiling emotions and riotous conflict filled with accusations, missed signals, and differences of opinion.  What is apparent is their boys are pawns in a game of dodging responsibility and covering up embarrassing behavior.Set in an elegant Amsterdam restaurant, the diners combine moments of condescension and accusation, along with bellicose exchanges with the restaurant staff and huffy retreats from the table.  The solutions are explored with obvious disagreement between all parties.  And, to the writer’s credit, he doesn’t impose his idea of what the solution should or will be.  The reader will determine any conclusion.  This might be unsatisfactory to some who like solid endings.This is a book that will promote some thinking in the reader.  Where and how far does the love of our children take us as protectors?  How much does our behavior reflect in our children’s development?  And how far should we let our emotions rule our actions?  My emotions gave this book four stars instead of five.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4ARG9G5FILT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385346859#wasThisHelpful","RT4ARG9G5FILT","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MASTERS OF THE GAME REVIEWFinally Joseph Epstein has taken his immense talent and intelligence and directed them to writing something I understand: Sports.  In “Masters of the Game,” Epstein has departed from topics such as the lives of writers, snobbery, ambition, de Tocqueville, and literary education to direct a book of essays at sports, its luminaries, and the happiness of being a spectator.  Ah, the joy.I have had occasion to admire Epstein’s works, especially those I understand.  He is a most intelligent and prolific writer, occasionally controversial, but mentally superior to many writers out there and a marvelous voice on behalf of those who toil at games and those who admire the struggle.In this, his twenty fifth book, he explains that sports is a noble outlet for “violent emotions, regaining adolescence, discovering metaphysical truths”…explaining why television sets glow all night and monstrous stadiums explode with lights and noise all over the world.  And he reminds us of those who play or have played the game, the likes of Thorp, Cobb, Dempsey, and modern idols such as DiMaggio, Jordan, and Ted Williams.  He has intelligent musings on gambling, Jewish athletes, performance enhancement, the effects of money, and even juggling.His erudite introduction is a precursor of the intensity and attraction of the book.  I can’t think of another writer who has as much insight and important things to say about sports.  It’s an extremely intelligent commentary that will leave the reader with a highly inflated IQ.  Sports aficionados won’t want to miss this one.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15H8QWNZ8AKVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442236531#wasThisHelpful","R15H8QWNZ8AKVJ","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SALTWATER COWBOYS REVIEWDayle Furlong, author of “Saltwater Cowboys,” comes from a long line of miners.She is a Canadian, originally from Newfoundland, and begins this story at a time when mining jobs are drying up and the miners, unskilled at anything else, are desperate for any job that can provide for them and their families.The story centers on the struggle of a couple of friends and their families who are forced to the gold mines of northern Alberta after losing their jobs in Newfoundland.  When they arrive, they find themselves outsiders (East coasters are considered “Saltwater Cowboys”) in an atmosphere of resentment.  Jack McCarthy is the more reserved of the two, slightly crippled, and reluctant to protect himself from the slights and bullying they encounter.  Peter Fifield, Jack’s best friend since grade school, is pugnacious and not one who will step back, earning him many lumps and bruises.  They have a pact to always protect each other’s back, a promise that becomes more difficult for Jack to keep when Peter decides to start pilfering gold ore from the mine.The two men’s’ wives are also very different in temperament.  While Peter’s wife enjoys her ill-gotten windfall, Jack’s is distraught with the entire situation and blames him for her declining mental state.  After she loses an unborn baby, Jack sees her as becoming even more disagreeable.  After being swindled, he, in turn, becomes deceitful and unfaithful, eventually caving into the temptation his friend is waving around.There are many wrinkles to Furlong’s story that, in fairness to the author, I shouldn’t disclose.  She has done a great job of capturing the atmosphere of a sorrowful life and dysfunctional families caught up in surreptitious activity.  Personalities change.  Family relationships become strained.  Depression and self-loathing become all enveloping.  It’s a realistic and fascinating appraisal.I recommend Furlong’s book.  It’s carefully crafted and aimed at the heart.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL38Z8B6QFLV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK499W8#wasThisHelpful","RL38Z8B6QFLV8","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BAD KARMA REVIEWDwight Holing has the gift of gab and a smart- aleck attitude going for him.  I like the second, not so much the first.  “Bad Karma” is a fun book that could use a little trimming, but I’ve been accused of wordiness in the past and feel somewhat hypocritical.  So I won’t dwell on that pan.The protagonist, Jack McCoul, lives in San Francisco, the book is situated there, and I recognize many of the characters from my days in the glorious city.  Holing has a knack for bringing the city to life and it made the backdrop joyous.  However the people I remember were even more colorful than those portrayed by the author.  It’s probably just as well he backed off a little there because my acquaintances were mostly strung out, somewhat smelly, and not of much interest.McCoul has a shifty friend hanging around who hungers for stuff – things that belong to other people.  When a priceless gold Buddha disappears and the owner, a mega rich tech mogul gets murdered, McCoul and his wife are up to their necks in suspicion.  When the Buddha shows up in friend’s possession, McCoul is forced into a desperate search for the killer as he tries to elude a couple of nasty assassins, plays hide and seek with the police, and tries to clear the bombshell wife of the dead guy, his wife’s best friend, who is also implicated.  Yes, it’s complicated but aren’t all mysteries that amount to anything?Holing does a great job plotting this story.  His characterizations are strong; his scenes of mayhem are realistic; his dialogue is spot on for the environment he presents.  There are a lot of familiar things happening that I’ve read before, but they seem fresh under Holing’s careful writing.It’s good book, full of action and snappy banter.  As I mentioned, some word pruning wouldn’t hurt but I’m light on that criticism because the overall effect is still good and the story moves along without being ponderous.  I believe you’ll enjoy the book.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTR1B3A8QH3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991130146#wasThisHelpful","R1GTR1B3A8QH3Z","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE WIVES OF LOS ALAMOS REVIEW“The Wives of Los Alamos” is Tarashea Nesbitt’s debut novel and it shines.  Nesbitt, in a unique style, delves into the people and attitudes behind a controversial episode in American history.  She presents insight into a way of life that is hard to imagine.  A secret remote desert location becomes home to six hundred and twenty families with no idea of why they are there. The young scientists and technicians involved in The Project are in the dark as to the purpose of their labors, the covertness of which impacts every inhabitant.  Even what little they do know cannot be shared with the family.Nesbitt, in a daring piece of writing technique, uses narration in the first person plural.  “Before we arrived at Los Alamos as wives and mothers we had been teachers in Seattle, housewives in New Jersey, watercolorists in Nebraska, writers in Des Moines, chemists at Harvard, and one of us had been a dancer in the Chicago ballet.”  As this example shows, the narrator has no individual traits.  We are given widespread examples of who the wives are without getting any individual attributes.  At first I found it somewhat disconcerting.  But the further I read the more I understood the author’s intention; an overall illustration of the environment without the burden of individual complexity.  I liked it.Now, of course, we all know the secret behind Los Alamos.  The husbands and fathers were scientists charged with developing portions of a nuclear weapon, although they were generally not aware of the end product or what was to be done with it.  The wives were allowed to accompany them to the site but had no idea of what was being developed because of the ban on sharing of information.Suddenly, all became clear when the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan. The secrets were no more.  A multitude of feelings surfaced as a result.  “Some of us thought we saved a half a million lives.  Some of thought we, or our husbands, were murderers, that we had helped light a fuse that would destroy the world.”  The author, throughout her book, as demonstrated here, presents both sides and doesn’t comment on the humanity of the product being developed.  The narration simply presents the many different behaviors and attitudes that might exist in a community that made such impact on the world.The author presents ideas on the social life, the jealousy, the flirting and affairs, gossip, and maybe some larceny committed because of the secrecy under which they all operated.  Those who were sacrosanct before the experience found themselves slipping into a life that was a little looser inside the rigid boundaries set upon them.  This slipping of morals, however slight, might be the biggest revelation about of the closeted life at Los Alamos.The author has done some great research and neither praises nor censures the residents.  Their circumstances are carefully laid out, their actions are outlined, the results are analyzed from several viewpoints, and the reader is left to decide whether or not to make judgments.The book is a marvelous chronicle of unsuspecting participants thrust into an alien place and time and how they survive.  At the book’s end, we are given a perspective on how life worked out for the families, both the adults and the children, after returning to a normal existence.  Great book with careful research and superb writing.  I highly recommend it.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPG0ZMNLOREX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620405032#wasThisHelpful","R2NPG0ZMNLOREX","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DOUBLE DOWN REVIEWTom Kakonis has been hailed as a successor to Elmore Leonard.  It’s true that his clever and gritty thrillers have some resemblance but I can’t put them in that lofty company just yet.  Leonard’s literary polish and creativeness set a high standard that Kakonis approaches, but this book doesn’t reach that level.The protagonist, Tim Waverly, is a gambler who seems to have a dark cloud hovering over him.  A drug boss warns him that he has two weeks to pay back $300,000 for some drugs he burned or face an untimely death. He manages to finagle his way into a high-stakes poker game with some big shot developers and a rich Arab prince where he hopes he can win enough money to pay the debt.  He realizes that even if he does come out a winner at cards, he will probably still be a target for hit men.  The story has many characters, many twists, and a lot of violence.  How Waverly survives the turmoil provides an ending that you will have to read for yourself.One character, Sigurd Stumpley, almost carries the story with his crude and boorish behavior.  Unfortunately he won’t be around for his own series but Kakonis might try to revive a similar spirit for a change-of- pace personality in his next stories.  A well-done portrait.I had a problem with unevenness in Kakonis’ writing.  One minute he is waxing philosophically with classical citations, the next he is spouting obscenities that would embarrass a longshoreman.  Periods of heavy introspection are interrupted with blasphemous rants about racial groups, fat women, and body functions.  Too much self-examination and deep thinking creates a wordiness that makes the clarity and flow seem murky.  Much of the verbosity could have been pared.Some snappy comebacks and great one-liners, however, kept me in the book.  The author has a great sense of humor that makes the dialogue sparkle in places.  An enjoyable read from an author with talent.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEL3X11YDPJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAJXAM6#wasThisHelpful","RAEL3X11YDPJ0","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DEAD FLOAT REVIEWWarren C. Easley is a writer who will give you an exciting read without putting you through a lot of mental gymnastics.  He tells his story in uncomplicated language at a pace you can handle.  “Dead Float, ” his 2014 novel, is the second about Cal Claxton, an everyday kind of guy who gets tangled up in messes he isn’t looking for, doesn’t want, then handles adroitly just because he has to.This story is about a fishing trip, the murder of one of the participants, a rush to judgment, and Claxton’s efforts to get from under the suspicion directed at him.  There are bad guys, good friends, beautiful women, and loyal pets woven together in a pleasantly spun narrative that eschews gory details and salacious sex.  There are great descriptions of the loveliness of Oregon, fishing scenes that make the homebound angler thirst for the river, and realistic dialogue that keeps the reader involved.  What Easley also provides is a well thought out sequence of events that are vividly described and engrossing.  And apparently the writer is a food fan; there are many references to victuals and the eating thereof.This book has just the right number of characters to provide interest, but not so many that the twists get knotted and snarled.  Other that the bad hombres, no one is really disagreeable.  My guess is that Easley has good, solid friends that he can use to sharpen his images.  I liked the book and can recommend it for a great summer read, especially along one of Oregon’s streams while waiting for the hatch to rise.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3064NT2EPU0KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464202680#wasThisHelpful","R3064NT2EPU0KR","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY REVIEWIf nothing else about the INS thrills us, we can thank the agency for getting Simon Wood into writing.  It took so long for Wood to get residency clearance when he arrived from the UK he was forced, despite the fact he was dyslexic, to write some dozen books and a hundred short stories just to make a living.He has other interests, of course, but the theme of conflict drives most of his writing.  In “The One That Got Away,” the protagonist is suffering from survivor guilt after being abducted, along with her girlfriend, by a maniac who treats them badly, then kills friend Holly after Zo Sutton frees herself and flees the scene.  A year later she gets involved with a law enforcement investigation of another abduction that resembles her own.  Although still consumed with guilt for abandoning her friend, Sutton get involved, generally makes a nuisance of herself until one of the investigators takes an interest in her obsession with finding the killer.  The madman discovers her existence and wants to get the one that got away.  I won’t go any deeper into the storyline, but suggest you read the book to unravel this inventive story.The important thing is to note is that Wood is a terrific writer who skillfully prepares his plot, realistically constructs his dialogue, and sets the scenes with an adroit command of language that places the reader right in the middle of the happenings.  How he manages that under the spell of dyslexia is perplexing to me who has no problem of that sort but who struggles with language in general.Some of the occurrences in the book are somewhat far fetched but Wood handles that with a casual flap to his writing style that says, “It’s my book, my vision, my idea, so deal with it and move along.”  I like that attitude and applaud Wood for his innovation.  I think you will agree that it’s a good, suspenseful, and entertaining read.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4X42Q2V3XC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612184081#wasThisHelpful","R2T4X42Q2V3XC7","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SUFFER THE CHILDREN REVIEWRobert Earle, after retiring from a twenty-year career as a United States diplomat, is attending to his first love of writing.  He is prolific and talented.  “Suffer the Children” is his take on circumstances that might arise from threats we face from gunmen who target schools.  He uses the December 15, 2012, massacre in a Connecticut elementary school as the basis for this story.An intense and somewhat disoriented retired Army General, Budge Kleeforth, renews his romantic interest in Pru Malvaeux, an earler love affair that ruined both his marriage and his career.  Together with a reclusive genius, they develop a defensive weapon that is intended to disable shooters, not kill them, and protect school children and teachers from the devastating effects of school mass shootings.  He takes his idea to his hometown, in close proximity to the school that was victim to the 2012 massacre, and convinces the anxious community to participate in a pilot program to introduce the non-lethal weapon into the classroom.Earle manages to capture all the drama and controversy such a program would initiate.  There’s indecision on the part of community leaders.  Strong pro and con opinions are voiced.  The gun industry sees a threat to its position on weapons ownership and usage.  And local teenagers believe they are best able to sort out the threats in their own community.Pru and Budge are eventually separated by conflicting ideas about their own involvement.  Pru sees a threat to her regaining the custody of her children and the ever goatish Budge finds a new love interest that tarnishes his enthusiasm for the program.  In the background the arms interest attempts to buy out the defensive weapon idea.  And, an intriguing side plot develops as a new shooting threat arises from an unexpected source.Earle’s writing is intriguing and uneven by design.  The entire topic of maniacal killing of masses of people, especially children, is going to be controversial and full of disparate feelings.  Earle does a masterful job of capturing that imbalance in the thoughts and actions of his characters.I thought his idea behind a non-lethal weapon being wielded by a teacher to be somewhat unrealistic.  But this is a fictional story with allowances necessary on the part of the reader.  The book is well written, carefully thought out, and thought provoking.  It is well worth reading.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JV1FSF9CCE69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMB7PXW#wasThisHelpful","R1JV1FSF9CCE69","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THINGS THAT MATTER REVIEWIt would be a good idea to have a dictionary handy while reading Dr. Krauthammer’s collection of insightful observations, “Things that Matter.”  The erudite author is clearly dedicated to plain speak but occasionally, like a body tic, he throws in a word that makes me fumble for Webster’s definitions.  Sometimes even that doesn’t help.I’m okay with that because I feel so much more intelligent after I read his material.  I even understand and applaud most of it.  I know.  I’m showing my conservative underwear.  But if you really concentrate on his ideas about civility, political foolishness, scientific and medical wonders, man and God, the Jewish question, terrorism, and life’s oddities, you will find much with which to agree.Along with his common-sense look at all things we encounter, he displays a jovial sense of humor and an appreciation of nonsensical happenings that enlivens his writing.He writes in defense of the F-word.  He makes fun of the American tendency towards arrogance.  He embraces the joy of losing with his devotion to the Washington Nationals.  He considers it a slow news day when the naming of the President’s dog is the leading topic of media conversation.So, you see, he is not all egg headed and solemn.  There’s twisted and whacky material in that splendid brain.Dr. Krauthammer is a magnificent thinker and writer.  It’s one thing to have a mind that can comprehend a myriad of complex issues and quite another to be able to explain them to a normal person.  Many geniuses of the world labor in obscurity because of this shortcoming.  Not so with this wise man and gifted communicator.Charles Krauthammer doesn’t have to go away when you close the book.  He writes a weekly column for a Washington D.C. newspaper that should be a must read if you are a fan.  He’s also a frequent contributor to a major TV network.  He has to be considered a national treasure regardless of your personal political leanings and this book is a tribute to his clearheaded thinking.

"THE STEADY RUNNING OF THE HOUR REVIEWJustin Go’s debut novel, “The Steady Running of the Hour,” is an epic love story including an intense study of the horrors of war and the climbing the world’s highest mountain.  It covers two centuries, mixes many cultures and traditions, is filled with complex characterizations, and travels all over the world.  It’s quite a trip, making for a long but satisfying read.Tristan Campbell learns he might be the heir to a huge estate left by famed mountaineer Ashley Walsingham who died on Mt. Everest in 1924.  After an unsettling meeting with a London law firm that claims to be legally prohibited from searching for heirs, Campbell, using his own rather meager funds, sets out in an attempt to satisfy the odd terms of the will.  There is a time limit, after which he will lose all rights to the inheritance.Some eighty years have passed since Walsingham’s death.  Campbell doesn’t have much family history to draw on so he gets off to a wobbly start. He tends to grasp at straws, causing the legal eagles to shake their heads and tell him he needs more facts.  He also finds a romance along the way that throws up some additional obstacles.  It seems a fool’s quest but he struggles on as time winds down.Go does a wonderful job of keeping all this turmoil under control.  His sense of time and place is well portrayed and his characterizations are nicely constructed.  One doesn’t get too enamored by any of the characters.  It’s all business and the author keeps it that way, not getting too bogged down with internal ruminations.  It’s an agreeable read that’s full of convincing developments.Go has worked hard at constructing this story.  Heavy research is evident, and the storyline is carefully worked out in spite of its complexities.  I was somewhat mystified and left wanting at the end, but that’s just me.  Readers will be able to apply their own interpretation to the way Go terminates his story.

Swanson, noted Lincoln scholar, has to be considered as a premier writer of narrative non-fiction. “Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln’s Killer” is a masterpiece of a no-nonsense chronicle, crisp and to the point, and as exciting as any fictional detective story.  He has to be placed among the ranks of Larson, Krakauer, Junger, and Winchester.When John Wilkes Booth shot President Abraham Lincoln on the night of April 14, 1865, he set off a manhunt that is unparalleled in American history.  For twelve days he was hunted through the Maryland and Virginia wilderness by droves of frantic searchers desperate to capture the infamous killer of an American hero.Swanson has his information immaculately researched, tightly wound together, and deftly reported in suspenseful prose taking an event we are all familiar with and making it a new-born incident complete with some interesting revelations.Swanson takes us from a dusky little theatre box in Ford’s Theatre to a tobacco barn in rural Virginia, death being the common theme.  He describes the actions of a demented and angry man who sends a lead ball burrowing through Lincoln’s brain.  That’s followed by an intense 12-day chase that ends with a bullet through the neck and spinal cord of the assassin.  In between there’s day-by-day reporting of other assassination attempts by accomplices who fail at their assignments.  Secret locations are uncovered, deceit and incompetence is displayed, and physical hardship is endured. There are cowardly actions, foolish decisions, and extreme loyalty, all brilliantly depicted by the author.A Civil War enthusiast since he was five years old, Swanson’s personal War reference library numbers several thousand books.  He has a vast collection of Lincoln memorabilia, Civil War newspapers, original photographs and posters, trinkets, and medals.  He knows this stuff and can write about it with simplicity and beauty.According to a March 2015 article in “Smithsonian,” Swanson calls himself a “crazed collector who happens to write books.”  He has a swatch of actress Laura Keene’s dress stained with Lincoln’s blood in his collection, and it never left his sight as he wrote about what happened in the Presidential box. He “could see it all and the paragraphs wrote themselves.”This is a must read for history buffs and lovers of true detective stories.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIK0PMQFS3X4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060518502#wasThisHelpful","RIK0PMQFS3X4L","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE BULLY OF ORDER REVIEWBrian Hart tries to present a memorable story, displays some talent, but, in the end, falls prey to the bane of all authors; the tendency to dig too deep and losing focus.His story about life’s hardships in the late 1880s Pacific Northwest has elements of realism, some great descriptive passages, and formidable characters.  Unfortunately, as it progresses, demented mind reflections, drunken visions, and the disorganized handling of common affairs too often cloud episodes of interest.  It is these departures that turn a grand idea into a stumbling account with a fuzzy storyline.As a Pacific Northwest resident I welcome stories of the area and am appreciative of the many talented writers who recount its wonders.  The hardscrabble conditions of soggy and frigid weather, exploiting the natural bounty of lumber, fish, and glittery minerals, and living an independent, stubborn life make for many adventures that demand chronicling.  Hart does that but unfortunately his story becomes as dreary as the weather and his characters as unlikeable as rain down the neck.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UV04LCSEBP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297740#wasThisHelpful","R21UV04LCSEBP3","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CLINTON CASH REVIEWPeter Schweizer certainly fits the definition of a muckraker; a reformed-minded journalist whose investigations dip into crooked politicians, unpleasant social issues, and ill-gotten money.  He even heads up an organization that specializes in exposing such malfeasance.  And, although muckraker is an ugly word, it’s not necessarily an offensive moniker.“Clinton Cash” is a bomb-tossing look at a couple of public figures who have long been targets of such investigations.  Bill and Hillary Clinton; the two names stir up a brouhaha of sentiment that is either highly derogatory or prompts breathless admiration.Schweizer’s book, as has been widely reported, is not complimentary but relies on solid information coupled with tireless research.  I’m sure he wears his title with head held high.In a complicated, well-grounded expose, the author delves into the seamy world of politics, bribery, greed, and favoritism.  The Clintons, if one believes what is written, are stars of a world where backs are scratched, huge amounts of money change hands in questionable deals, and powerful people ride the backs of those with immense influence.One of the questions that Schweizer asks repeatedly in his book is why do the Clintons get involved with so many people of ill repute?  He answers it with illustrations of the vast amounts on money the couple have accumulated through the years, particularly when Hillary was Secretary of State and could exert tremendous influence on worldwide decisions.  Bill has been paid millions of dollars to give speeches, mostly complementary, of scabby world leaders and corrupt public works processes, and has received huge donations to the family foundation along with immense speaking fees.  Shortly thereafter, Hillary makes favorable decisions in her official capacity that garner lucrative returns to the cash cows that more than justifying the initial investment.There are some who claim the Clintons could care less about money and influence.  The laughter that follows such declarations is loud and raucous.  Their storybook rise from rags to riches, haunted along the way with shady deeds, is not one of innocence and purity.There has been tremendous research into the premise of the book, all duly noted in the book notes.  The convoluted arrangements are mind-numbing but clearly laid out by the author.  Of course the reader’s political persuasion will dictate the believability.

"PALACE OF TREASON REVIEWJason Matthews is a master at concocting intriguing spy stories.  His new novel, “Palace of Intrigue,” continues the adventures of Dominika Egorova and Nathaniel Nash who were introduced to readers in his Edgar Award winning “Red Sparrow.”  This book is a stand-alone story of current international political events presented in totally believable prose by someone who’s been there.Matthews, a retired CIA officer, with over thirty years of clandestine prowling around the world of international intelligence, knows of what he writes and the authenticity of his stories rings loud and clear.  His writing is crystal clear, his characterizations are right on, his dialogue crackles with reality, and his scenic descriptions are vivid and authentic.This book is not for the faint hearted.  Torture sessions and assassinations are presented in full color and striking detail.  The absolute evil of the villains makes one’s teeth hurt.  And an overabundance of dolts in high places is also carefully documented, giving just the right balance to his characters.In an epicurean touch, the author has included a recipe at the close of each chapter for a regional food treat that appears somewhere in the story.  They appear delicious; red lentil soup, potato pancakes with mushroom sauce, stuffed buns with beets, cold cucumber soup.  Unfortunately, when considered along with the circumstances under which they appeared in the text, I’ll wait awhile before I try them.The spy business is actually very wearisome and mundane except for brief periods of terrifying confrontations and constant expectation of a horrible death.  Matthews is very adept at bringing his reader along for these moments.  I urge you to indulge Jason Mathews, travel with him, and then enjoy the quiet when you return to your safe house.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIFEFY10D6GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476793743#wasThisHelpful","R3SIFEFY10D6GB","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CHILDREN OF PARADISE REVIEWFred D’Aguiar in “Children of Paradise” is attempting to tell the story of the Jim Jones commune in Guyana.  In some ways it’s interesting but it mostly falls flat for me because of his attempts to bring poetry to a story that resists poetic musicality.The preacher, as the Jones inspired leader of the commune, performs sermons that mesmerize his followers and induces near catatonic disciples to follow his every command.  The author does a good job of wording the sermons so even the reader can see the overt seduction.  But the reality ends there.There is a gorilla called extraordinary by publicists that should be labeled unbelievable.  The characters wind in and out of a story that is hard to follow and the ending produces confusion and a sense of unfulfillment that renders the story unsettled.  We all know how the Jonestown tragedy really ended, yet the author adds mystery and conjecture to his story making it unfathomable.The author, a native of Guyana, writes beautifully of the attributes of the location.  His prose, however, written in the present tense, is less than intriguing and is sometimes difficult to decipher, perhaps too poetic in its construction.The book is an interesting look at mass hypnotism and the indecency of brainwashing, but stumbles as it tries to establish itself as authentic historical fiction.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WUWLW5Z9VJKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062277324#wasThisHelpful","R1WUWLW5Z9VJKN","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE STORY OF LAND AND SEA REVIEWAs intriguing as Katy Simpson Smith’s debut novel “The Story of Land and Sea” might be, I find her personal thoughts and essence even more so.First, about the book.  It’s a turbulent tale, told gently, of the latter days of the American Revolution and the heartbreak of slavery.  The setting is a small town in North Carolina where three generations of family exist in the turmoil of war, abduction, slavery, and strange notions about love.There’s a strong wife and mother, Helen, a ten-year old daughter, Tabitha, the husband and father, John, who loses them both and ventures off in a strange voyage of discovery with the black son of Moll, a slave with strong personal ties to Helen.  Asa, Helen’s father, is the owner of a small plantation who had given Moll to Helen when they were both young girls and who, as later years provides conflicts to his beliefs, cannot bring himself to free Moll, invoking more struggles.  Sounds confusing and is, but Smith manages to present the tangled web in a well thought-out story.As for the author, Katy Simpson Smith, I find her to be a very interesting and talented woman who, in researching the history of mothers in the South, discovered that death during childbirth was very common during the late 1770s and fathers often had to raise daughters on their own.  The specter of their wives’ deaths created more tendencies to sort of mope around more than actually be leaders in the activities of the time.  Women taking initiative is a strong theme in this book.Smith reveals she is always nervous about speaking about people with different experiences than her own but she believes there is the responsibility to do just that.  She wants her research as an historian to create fiction that is factual for the period.As an example of her ingenuity, a wooden marker in an eighteenth-century graveyard in Beauford, North Carolina, inscribed “Little Girl Buried in Rum Keg,” inspired a notable incident in Smith’s novel.There is clarity of language and beatific scene setting in Smith’s writing.  There is also carefully cultivated characterization that allows the reader get vibrations of real human activity instead of being spoon-fed contrived behavior.  That’s refreshing.“Land and Sea” has captured all I expect from great historical fiction.  Captivating times, impeccable research, believable dialogue, and the chance to realistically revisit the glorious past are all here.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131K4VEQ83CHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062335944#wasThisHelpful","R131K4VEQ83CHZ","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE NAKED CONSUMERHaving just read “Dead Wake,” Erik Larson’s latest blockbuster, and having consumed each of his previous novels, I ran across his very first book, a nonfiction account of how companies spy on the consumer.  I was curious as to how Larson would report on my least favorite social activity.  He handled it with remarkable aplomb.Published in 1992, when Larson was a free-lancer living in Baltimore, it’s a book he claims to love, although apparently no one else did.  It is not the booming hit his later novels have become, but I liked it and believe that the consumer, even more put upon now by sleazy marketing than when Larson wrote the book, would find it mesmerizing and should read it.Larson, in his clear and precise reporting, tells us how tax dollars have enabled marketers to find us, zero in on our secret wishes, and persuade us to buy things we don’t need.  We are all on lists that help companies locate us, determine what we are patsies for, and how to make us empty our pocketbooks.  The US Census, as have many other public agencies, although confidentiality is promised, has given immense amounts of information to companies that exist to sort through, quantify, and assemble data into lists that identify every person in our country by name, address, ethnicity, economic wealth, living condition, household makeup, religion, and any other characteristic that’s usable in determining vulnerability to marketing schemes...and to make a great deal of money doing so.This book is complex and mindboggling. To me it is also infuriating.  I’m not some nave dolt who thinks I exist in a vacuum, safe and secure in my cocoon of privacy.  But Larson has opened my eyes to an irritating conspiracy that, while seemingly harmless, is a pervasive intrusion into privacy.  Areas of my personal activity, the value of my home, credit limits on my charge cards, bank account balances, access to my passwords, PIN numbers and, perhaps my preference in underwear are all fair game to these scavengers, information I insist is none of their business.It never entered my mind that a little innocuous viewing window, the scanner at the checkout stand, could also pass on so much information about me. Combined with the frequent shopper card information I willingly passed out in exchange for gasoline savings, money bonuses, and premiums, it itemizes the commodities I purchase, screens, scores, analyzes the results, and digs deep into my existence.  Huge corporations lust for this information.The information here is dated because of when it was written.  I suspect that public infuriation at privacy invasion, manifest in the 1990s, is even greater now. Larson is urging us to recognize that privacy is indeed an unalienable right and that those charged with our protection must do so with dogged resolve.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWX4TAKKIUWDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140233032#wasThisHelpful","RWX4TAKKIUWDO","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BLACK RIVER REVIEWI’ve read many novels this year with top-grade writing and satisfying stories.  S.M. Hulse’s “Black River” is among the best.  This is a debut novel and it’s a magnificent first effort.  I know nothing of Hulse, but I suspect that she will become a more familiar figure in the writing world.The story is not complicated.  The prose is crisp.  The characters are clearly delineated.  Dialogue is masterfully rendered.  And the author keeps introspection simple and unfettered, making the book easy to comprehend.  It is simplistic by the most positive definition.A corrections officer is taken prisoner some twenty years earlier by a sadistic inmate during a Montana prison riot.  The officer is tortured and his hands are horribly crippled, a significant infirmity because of his love for fiddling.  The ensuing years are a struggle as self-pity, thoughts of revenge, and depression disrupt his life and his relationship with a loving wife and his stepson.Now, at age 60, he returns to the prison town of Black River with his wife’s ashes intending to put her at rest and to attend a parole hearing that threatens to set his torturer free.  Hulse makes effective use of telling the story from both the man and his wife’s perspective.  Each is featured throughout the book, a technique that sometimes muddies the storyline, but one that the author handles with great dexterity.The book is filled with magnificent depictions about how the playing of a musical instrument can be so gratifying, how the loss of the skill can be so devastating, how words can never seem to fill an emotional gap, how earlier joy can become sour ashes.  The author displays an insight that far exceeds her youthful experience, a trait that signals great things ahead.I can recommend this rather morose book as an uplifting experience and the opportunity to celebrate a young writer’s talent.  It has moved to the top of my 2015 favorites.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KIX16AFRFONL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544309871#wasThisHelpful","R3KIX16AFRFONL","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BOOTLEGGER REVIEWClive Cussler is often called the grandmaster of adventure and, indeed, he has authored over fifty books, many of them bestsellers.  But missteps happen, and “The Bootlegger,” in my opinion, is a stumble.The story is an involved study of the Prohibition era complete with hijackers, bootleggers, crooked cops, Coast Guardsmen on the take, and a private detective agency that defies description for its massive operations.  Throw in New Jersey, Wall Street, Florida, the Bahamas, Cuba, and Nassau, along with government intrigue, foreign secret agents, and weapons from all over the world and a reading stew of massive proportions is formed, much too difficult to divide into understandable portions.Throughout the book I felt like I was looking through small windows at a carousel, never really feeling involved with the whirling diversion inside.  I kept reading hoping that Cussler would throw the doors wide open at some point revealing all the revelry, but it never happened.I know the author can do better, and I’ll keep checking for something akin to the many blockbusters I’ve enjoyed in the past.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QABJ73G1U5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425272818#wasThisHelpful","R38QABJ73G1U5E","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DRIVING THE KING REVIEWThis book has an intriguing premise, a close look at Nat King Cole.  Cole is a musical icon whose life and times have been treated rather skimpily by writers.  Ravi Howard has attempted to change that with a fictional account of Cole and his driver/bodyguard Nat Weary.  As autobiographical fiction, it didn’t work for me.I know a little about Nat King Cole and discovered too many alterations of facts to place much credence to Howard’s story.  Too many holes crop up and too many incidents don’t square with reality.Cole was actually attacked in Birmingham, not Montgomery, and was rescued by the police, not by some courageous friend.  There were three attackers and a fourth who apparently was the getaway driver.  All four went to prison.  Cole was so angered by the attack that he refused to ever perform in the South again.Cole’s actual life was eventful and full of controversy.  He even ran afoul of the NAACP and was called a traitor and narrow-minded for his failure to actively challenge racial discrimination.  Both Thurgood Marshall and Roy Wilkins publicly chastised him for his indifference to racial matters.  He was deeply hurt and eventually joined in boycotts and became active in the civil rights movement.Cole was a womanizer who miraculously maintained good relationships with his ex-wives; in fact his second wife, Maria, was with him throughout his battle with lung cancer until he died in 1965.I mention a couple of events in Cole’s life to point out that Howard could have created a spellbinding story had he included more real Cole moments.Howard’s story is a good one, but suffers from the lack of an intriguing storyline.  Cole appears as a character behind drapery, never really being fully exposed.  This was not enough disclosure for me.  I wanted more Nat King Cole.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24F5MAQJUSFML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006052961X#wasThisHelpful","R24F5MAQJUSFML","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DEAD WAKE REVIEWI consider Erik Larson to be one of our finest writers and have wolfed down each of his books.  I’m sure my reviews reflect this almost cultish devotion and “Dead Wake” certainly fits right in.Larson is obsessive about his research.  That, to me, is the most important quality of any great writer.  Getting mountains of information together and presenting it in an organized and entertaining book is the least writers can do if they expect to have a loyal following.  Even Larson’s end Notes are a joy to read.In “Dead Wake,” Larson follows many trails.  The Lusitania, a magnificent cruise ship, is filled with international passengers of many backgrounds and agendas who settle in for a pleasant voyage across the Atlantic.  It’s early in World War I and there are rumors of German submarines lurking near the English coast looking to sink such a fine prize.  But the travelers and crew ignore direct threats and rely instead on comforting assurance from the British Admiralty as to their safety and head east with little concern; not a wise decision.In the waters around the British Isles there’s a dedicated German U-boat captain, Walther Schwieger, who prowls the seas with orders to attack and sink troop transports that might be carrying personnel deployed to resupply British forces in France.  Larson, with his typical clarity, explains how the luxury liner, captained by William Thomas Turner, gets ensnared in a web of deceit, misinformation, and changes in German intent, that ultimately lead to it being torpedoed by Schwieger’s Unterseeboot 20.In Larson’s inimitable style, he tucks little bits of interesting facts into the pages that add to the reader’s ability to visualize the background, interpret the complicated forces that make up the story, and bring reality to the characters’ behavior and their involvement.  Suspense increases as lapses in protection are magnified by German persistence.We see Turner’s stubborn dedication that overcomes missteps in the early years of his career.  We are almost sympathetic to a U-boot captain who can, without a twinge of remorse, drive a torpedo into a ship filled with humanity but then be unable to watch the traumatic results. We experience an American president’s anguish over the loss of his wife and subsequent infatuation with another woman, the timing of said romance to be unfortunate when he should be exhibiting total attention to the American condition.There are studies of the passengers and their behavior, manner of dress, varied financial circumstances, and purpose.  Life aboard a submarine is detailed. There is glamour, suspense, family loss and triumph, official missteps, and the notorious Room 20, a most important element in this story.This book is another example of Erik Larson’s talent.  Don’t miss it.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUPDY2ME2GS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307408868#wasThisHelpful","R1TUPDY2ME2GS2","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SAVAGE HARVEST REVIEWWhen I read the first ten pages of Carl Hoffman’s epic tale of Michael Rockefeller and his 1961 New Guinea explorations, I wondered where the author was taking it.  It appeared that he had answered the question of what happened to the young adventurer and there was no need to read further.  I was wrong.The author was setting the stage for what has been a perplexing riddle about Rockefeller’s disappearance.  Did he drown after setting out on a desperate swim to escape a watery grave?  Or did he survive the 10-mile swim only to be captured, murdered, and subsequently eaten by savages. Hoffman has attempted, through exhaustive research, interviews of witnesses, and four months living among the natives who allegedly were responsible, to piece together the actual events.The book jacket says Hoffman “finally tells the full, astonishing story.”  I don’t get that impression.  The author has investigated and pieced together a scenario that, at best, can be labeled probable.  It is not definitive and, indeed, has been rejected by the Rockefeller family as not viable and the cause of Michael’s death has been formally labeled as “drowning.”The Asmat, a tribe of warriors with an inscrutable culture of violence, cannibalism, and headhunting, has only recently been declared as free of those traditions.  However, members remain secretive and elusive about past occurrences and admit to giving answers that are evasive. They make things up while maintaining absolute secrecy about actual events.  There is no malice intended.  Rather their intention is to get along with the questioner. Even Hoffman has not been able to turn up any solid facts one way or another, which leads to his best guess as to the actual events.The inability of Hoffman to produce evidence beyond any reasonable doubt could be considered a flaw in his book.  I believe that this failure has been remarkably well handled by Hoffman and he expects the reader to examine the gleaned information and form an opinion as to its veracity, much the same as a jury would when deliberating a trial.What is interesting to me is the total conviction that Asmat hold regarding their culture, practices, taboos, and spiritual beliefs.  They are what they are and they have no interest in or reason to change.  The pressure to change their ways comes from others who don’t share their devotion to a way of life.Hoffman does an excellent job of presenting this culture gap.  There is a certain indifference to other ideas by the Asmat, an innocence that is refreshing.  Their life is hard by our standards, but perfectly acceptable to them, even Elysian.  So, when the tribesmen who know the most about Michael Rockefeller sense a dislike for what was a perfectly normal in their culture, they dodge the issue and insert or omit information more in line with what they sense is acceptable to the outside world, a trait initially developed to get along with strait-laced missionaries.This is a good book that is sometimes perplexing with its many characters with confusing names that have varied relationships and degrees of involvement.  It needs to be read carefully, keeping in mind the difference between our cultures.  You probably won’t like some of the gorier details about how the Asmat live, how they think, and some of their traditional practices.  But hopefully you will come to appreciate their innocent adherence to principle and tradition.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116EUFBWWDMWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062116169#wasThisHelpful","R116EUFBWWDMWU","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A HOARSE HALF-HUMAN CHEER REVIEWI hadn’t heard of X.J. Kennedy until I read the blurb for his novel “A Hoarse Half-Human Cheer.”  He has emerged from behind his dozens of books of poetry to write his first adult novel.  It’s a comedic foray into a world of academia that is filled with oblivious administrators, stained Fathers, unschooled war veterans, nervous students, inept mobsters, and a beautiful nymphomaniac who doesn’t give a fig for accepted behavior.  Kennedy was 85 when he published this book in 2014, but don’t stereotype his work as stodgy.An obscure Catholic college in upper New Jersey is down at its heels and struggling.  Forced to admit 4,500 war veterans at the end of World War II to keep its doors open, it also leaves itself vulnerable to mismanagement, an illegal military surplus fraud, Mafia interference, inept faculty hires, and campus deterioration.  In this frazzled world we find struggling students, a priest with a fondness for young boys and the grape, inept Mafia kingpins, a collared basketball coach who is targeted for a violent end, and a beautiful teacher who is more than happy to conduct after class instruction.There is arson, firebombing, exorcism, a brothel raid, a basketball game without players, crumbling buildings, and a graduation with gunplay.  Kennedy loosely weaves it all together and presents glowering prospects with comedic outcomes that will sometimes leave you sputtering with laughter.  The characters, too numerous to categorize, are zany and somewhat out of focus, but that is the way the entire book is structured.  It is fuzzy and frantic but pleasing and fun to read.I’m not ecstatic about the book.  Some of the dialogue seemed contrived and a little dated.  But I enjoyed the overall entertainment of watching inept people flounder in their own follies.  So I recommend it for its diversionary value.  I’m more impressed with F.X. Kennedy’s amazing poetry.  Read his “In a Prominent Bar in Secaucus One Day” for a delightful straight up account of a former beauty accepting her role as a barfly.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQ0A86LE0GG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2KEXO6#wasThisHelpful","RGQ0A86LE0GG7","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WRECKAGE REVIEWI have mixed emotions about “Wreckage,” Emily Bleeker’s novel about two castaways who return to their former lives after two years on a deserted island.  The writing and scenic portrayals are good.  The premise of the book that somehow the two survivors feel the need to concoct a web of lies about their experiences doesn’t square with what actually happened.  I won’t screw up the book by saying anything other than I didn’t see the need for elaborate lies that would certainly be uncovered.Lillian and Dave are the survivors; four others were there but didn’t come back.  An ill-fated contest prize trip goes awry when the charter plane carrying two winners, a sponsor’s rep, an airline hostess, and the pilot crashes in the sea on the way to a tropical paradise.  There’s a lifeboat scenario, a deserted island refuge, survival efforts, personal conflicts, and the gradual reduction of victims through consequences I won’t reveal.The writing was good but not excellent.  The storyline was well presented, if not totally believable.  The dialogue was somewhat sophomoric and the characters turned out to be rather weak and unlikeable.  I finished the book with luke warm interest because I was just not buying the story.  I suppose I somewhat resemble the repulsive newscaster who was determined to out Lillian and Dave, although I already knew the story but didn’t understand its premise.  Neither do I see the need to ruin everyone’s life by being snarky.Survival stories are always interesting, as are romances that flourish under tropical skies.  I like tales of survival.  Sticky romances; not so much.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10HK0SYJUR5VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAJZDIM#wasThisHelpful","R10HK0SYJUR5VV","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MAÑANA REVIEWThis is not a pretty story but William Hjortsberg has written something that reverberates and makes the reader pay attention.  A hapless, chemically impaired drifter finds himself in bed with a dead hooker.  He also finds his knife in the bloody mess, as well as blood stained hands and an empty memory bank.  As the fog clears he remembers three equally disreputable men and his wife as being somewhere in the vicinity when the nightmare occurred but they are not there now.  “Maňana” is the story of this loser who goes looking for the missing group through the dregs of Mexico, trying to find answers.It’s a first person account of drinking, drugging, and stumbling around in a beat up VW van in search of things he doesn’t want to find, in a world where he’s out of place, in locations where he’s not comfortable, with people who are mean and ugly. Give the author credit.  He manages to make the atmosphere interesting even as he delves into drug use, murder, and wired sex.  His descriptions of captivating Mexican locations, customs, and tradition are artfully enveloped in a gritty environment that both captivates and horrifies.  The writing is clear and crisp even though a baked brain and conflicting emotions screw up the narrator’s mind.The novel is an easy read, the writing is alluring, and there’s a certain amount of empathy that comes across for a stoner who can’t help himself get straight.  I enjoyed the book, although it will fade from my memory much the same as the night of throat cutting departed from the mind of our hero.  It’s entertainment that grabs with an elusive touch, but easily goes away.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UW645Z7YB45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497680735#wasThisHelpful","R18UW645Z7YB45","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LAST BREATH REVIEWAs I sit reading “Last Breath,” Peter Stark’s engrossing study of life’s last moments during venturesome activities, a sudden thought occurs.  I’ve done several of the activities he writes about, and experienced some of the physiological hardships he discusses.  Not to the extremes he portrays, of course, but I’ve been cold, thirsty, overheated, and even nearly drowned.  I can appreciate that had any of my hardships progressed to the levels of his discussions, I wouldn’t be here right now.  That’s sobering.For this book Stark has conducted immense research and interviewed a vast array of medical specialists.  He has plumbed the depths of normally recalcitrant research labs, reticent scientists, wilderness conference attendees, and adventurers from many disciplines.  With the information he has gathered he dissects hypothermia, drowning, mountain sickness, burial by avalanche, scurvy, heatstroke, falls, predators, the bends, malaria, and dehydration.  To top it off, he includes an essay on his own fear of death.It’s a thought-provoking book that conjures up intense personal feelings about one’s mortality and willingness to take chances.  It illuminates moments of foolishness and bravery, although the bravery most always leads to poor decisions.  Stark knows how to make each experience resonate within the reader like a fire bell.  In my case, introspection leads to disturbing thoughts of the way things could have been had my comfort zone been larger.The author uses a highly effective technique of creating a story leading to each mishap.  He weaves wonderful tales of seemingly innocuous circumstances leading to decisions that illustrate how judgment can bring death to careless adventurers.  A Jeep stuck in the snow prompts the driver to attempt to walk to his destination, a warm and cheery mountain cabin filled with friends.  A kayaker bites off more river than he can swallow.  A hot dogging snow boarder creates an avalanche that traps him in its cold embrace.  A rock climber falls, is seemingly saved by a ledge, but then succumbs in a lonely place from injuries caused by his sudden stop.  A cyclist attempts to blow away her competition by a sprint that ends up with a fatal heatstroke.Every end result benefits from Stark’s careful explanation of the physical possibilities that exist, the actual damage incurred in each scenario, and what the stricken person’s mind envisions as trauma overtakes him or her.  The chattering thought process will carry over to the reader, bringing dismay and a bit of self-study.  I sucked on an orange the entire time I was reading the chapter on scurvy.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYR7G2MFSIBG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345441516#wasThisHelpful","RYR7G2MFSIBG5","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE MESSENGER REVIEWIt would appear that Daniel Silva is the apple of the Charbonneau Book Club’s eye.  We read “The English Woman” less than a year ago and “The Messenger” is our new assignment.  It was written about seven years earlier than “Woman” but, with Silva, there’s no worry about staleness seeping in.  He’s always a refreshing read.In this Gabriel Allon adventure the intrepid Jewish spy is assigned to find an elusive al-Qaeda bigwig who is planning an assassination attack on both the Pope and the president of the United States. After already devastating parts of the Vatican and killing hundreds of people with an audacious daytime bombing, the terrorist operative is continuing his rabid campaign against his sworn enemies.  Cloaked in anonymity and possessed of great wealth and power, this dangerous fanatic must be rooted out and eliminated before he strikes, although Allon knows the search will be extremely risky and complicated.  He plans a trap using bait the operative can’t resist.Once again Silva demonstrates incredible knowledge of his subject, this time the complexities of mid Eastern religion terrorist activity, and Roman Catholic convention.  His plotting is intricate and unassailable.  His characterizations are immaculate and their realism resonates with the reader. Event after event keeps unfurling as the author assaults the reader’s mind with inventive and adventurous ideas.Silva employs spotless grammar and writing skills in his books.  One always feels more intelligent after reading him because of the information he unveils and the respect he gives to the reader’s brainpower.  He is a true master at creating the very quintessential adventure novel, entertaining and full of fascinating detail.Silva has a tried and true formula by which he operates.  Allon’s skill is paramount to his stories.  The attractive female agent who faces death with aplomb is always present.  Immensely skilled associates handle details that would befuddle lesser mortals.  But it all works and each new novel is eagerly awaited by his plethora of fans.It’s difficult to rank Silva’s books by which is better.  Each one has it’s own ingenious subject matter.  Some ideas might register better than others, depending on the reader’s interest, but none will disappoint.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQJ5JC97BKOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451221729#wasThisHelpful","R1RQJ5JC97BKOU","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A PEARL IN THE STORM REVIEWTori Murden McClure isn’t interested in having me as an admirer so I won’t say that I am.  I’ll just say that I respect her and the strong person that she is.She has stated that she considers herself an introvert.  I’m not sure about that.  She shows some proclivity to being an extrovert as well.  She is industrious, grasps reality with vigor, and is comfortable with a struggle.  One needs only to read “A Pearl in the Storm” to see those traits, not necessarily associated with being an introvert.Her accomplishments are many.  She is highly educated, president of a university, the first woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean, and the first to ski overland to the South Pole.  In her spare time she has climbed mountains over several continents.  So this shy, retiring flower is as far out there as one can get.In “Pearl” McClure takes the reader on two rowing trips on the Atlantic.  The first, in 1998, from west to east, ended when a series of ferocious hurricanes sunk her boat and nearly killed her. The second, about a year later, from east to west was successful after spending 81 days rowing some 3,3000 miles.  A strengthened vessel, better equipment, and maybe a better frame of mind saw her through.  She credits winning battles with herself over what she considered a failure on her first effort, a face to face with Muhammad Ali, and strong moral support from her new husband and faithful friends as providing the catalyst she needed to persevere on the second attempt.McClure’s writing is clear and highly descriptive.  I was with her through every upset, physical battering, and violent weather episode.  I did face plants in the goo and poo splattered around her miniscule cabin.  I also spent unforgettable nights with her looking at billions of stars from the rowing deck.  Physically participating in an adventure is the pinnacle of my reading experiences.  The author took me with her.It’s a great book for lovers of sea stories.  Actually taking this sort of death defying journey speaks to the courage of McClure.  Continuing with another after the disastrous results, physical damage, and traumatic upset of the first reaches new levels of perseverance.  There are not many of us daring enough to attempt it.Okay, I’m going to say it.  I admire Tori Murden McClure.  Belittle me if you must, but read this book.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVV3E3DMK611B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061718874#wasThisHelpful","RVV3E3DMK611B","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ASTORIA REVIEWPeter Stark is an adventure and exploration writer.  That’s a fair and fitting description. The knowledge and talent on display in his writing certainly supports it.“Astoria,” is Stark’s riveting look at the trials faced by John Jacob Astor in his bold attempt to set up a fur-trading monopoly in the Pacific Northwest in the early 1800s.  His two-pronged endeavor, one by land and one by sea, ended in failure, but the monumental struggles faced by his representatives will keep the reader both enthralled and horrified.A seagoing party, aboard the ship Tonquin, was to sail around South America and up the west coast of North America to where the Columbia River meets the Pacific Ocean. An overland party would leave the east coast of the United States and follow the trail of Lewis and Clark to the same location where the combined group would establish a fur-trading empire.  It was all funded by Astor’s tremendous wealth, carefully planned, adequately supplied, and strongly supported by Thomas Jefferson who could envision the West Coast of the continent adding valuable territory to the fledgling country.Deleterious conditions plagued the two expeditions.  The sea travelers encountered violent weather, stormy water, a dictatorial captain, sickness, and hunger that decimated the crew.  The cross-country explorers fought their way through cold and snowy conditions as they fended off natives prone to thievery and warfare, suffered from lack of food and water, struggled over steep terrain and wild rivers, following a leader who was weak in decision-making and people skills.Even after the two depleted and demoralized crews met, the lack of organization, deplorable weather, and backbreaking work continued to weaken them.  In the end the colony, known as Astoria, collapsed under the strain.  The crews scattered as the members struggled to survive.Stark writes this history with the eye of a fiction writer.  He melds intense research and innumerable facts into a readable story that supplants the usual aridity of historical details.  We learn about catabolism, where a person’s body eats its own fat and tissue to survive; scurvy, a debilitating illness brought on by a vitamin deficiency; and post-traumatic stress syndrome that brings madness and suicidal behavior.  Although Astor always maintained that his plan was solid and his men were weak, the author clearly describes conditions that no person could be expected to endure.Of particular note are the footnotes (full of meaningful information), helpful maps, an insightful afterword, and a wealth of research notes.  A complete index is also helpful.This is a book of feelings; the reader suffers the icy winds and inexorable rain, the physical exertion, the bodily deterioration.  The author totally immerses his audience into an atmosphere of mesmerizing misery.

"THE INVENTION OF WINGS REVIEWSue Monk Kidd is a remarkable writer with insight, a talent for storytelling, and the ability to create characters that resonate with the reader.  “The Invention of Wings” is a vivid novel that engages the reader in a historical period that has been dealt with many times but seldom with such jarring intensity and compassion.Sarah Grimke, the daughter of a wealthy landowner and holder of many slaves in Charleston, is given a 10-year old black girl for her eleventh birthday to act as her handmaid.  Kidd’s novel, based on actual people and events, traces their lives in parallel stories over the next thirty-five years as Sarah struggles with her aversion to slavery and Handful, as the slave is known, battles the cruelty of the institution with its demands, punishments, and family disruptions.  Their relationship is perplexing with its periods of defiance, love, misunderstanding, and futile efforts at merging two cultures.Kidd presents each experience using chapters that alternate between Sarah and Handful as the years progress.  Sarah, along with her sister, Angelina, grows to be a force in abolition and women’s rights while Handful emulates her mother’s pugnacious behavior as she uses guile in her abolition efforts, stealing if necessary, to confuse and muddle tradition.  Through the years, although separated by distance, their mutual dedication to disrupting the practice of slavery continues, Sarah to great notoriety and Handful to personal pain, disfigurement, and adversity.It is a moving story of two women and their common fight against oppression, although different approaches are used in their individual battles.  The author does a splendid job of outlining each adventure and the different challenges that each woman faces.The characterizations are beautifully drawn.  The dialogue sparkles.  The period descriptions are historically correct and appropriate for the times.  Kidd is careful to explain in her Author’s Note that the Grimke sisters were authentic and the first female abolition advocates as well as among the earliest feminist activists.  Their struggles and motivations, as well as Sarah’s inner voice and actual life, are the author’s interpretations based on her research.  Handful is a fictional character Kidd devised to add a slave’s voice and life to the story so both worlds could be presented.  Handful is a wonderfully created character with spunk, determination, and a sassy spirit that longs for freedom.This is not a Civil War book.  In fact the events begin some sixty years earlier.  It is a time when the institution of slavery was deeply imbedded in the South and radical attempts at abolition were deeply resented but not taken very seriously.  It is very illuminating to this reader who is more familiar with the time surrounding the war.

"THE GLASS PALACE REVIEWIndian writer Amitav Ghosh is uniquely qualified to take his readers on a historical journey through the exotic lands of India, Burma (now known as Myanmar), and Malaya.  Ghosh, born in Calcutta, spent his childhood in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India and studied in Delhi, Oxford, and Alexandria.  The cities of Calcutta, Mandalay, Rangoon, and Singapore that invoke flights of fancy in both literature and music play a major part in his remarkable novel, “The Glass Palace.”Ghosh is caught up in the politics and nationalism of India and its surrounding countries and it shows in his writing.  He asserts that colonialism has had ruinous effects on underpopulated countries by removing natural resources.  In Burma’s case it is the oil, timber, and ivory.  In “Palace” he is particularly harsh on the presence of Great Britain.  This disturbs some critics, although Ghosh is factual in his reporting and his complaints are well documented.Nevertheless, Ghosh writes with a beautiful and descriptive style that is captivating.  His scenic sketches are mesmerizing.  His characterizations are immaculate; there’s not a single character in “Palace” that doesn’t strike the right chord with the reader.  The book is a lengthy read but I never lost interest in his story.The basic storyline involves a young Burmese orphan, Rajkumar, who, at eleven, possesses the acumen and drive to rise to be a wealthy rubber tree plantation owner, highly respected by both family and community.  Some one hundred years of familial relationships and national turmoil are reported covering a vast geographical area.  Wars are fought.  There are complicated alliances across cultures and countries. Rebellions develop and are crushed. Personal relationships ebb and flow.  Fortunes are earned and then slip away in the clutches of war and colonialism.Through it all, the reader is treated to thoughtful and accurate writing with historical detail being carefully drawn.  The splendor of the Burmese kingdom is destroyed by the unceremonial removal of the royal family, an astute move by the British to both humiliate and remove the King from public memory.  Burma’s valuable natural resources were then easily plundered and the gentle life became chaotic.The invasion by Japan causes further disruption and war scenes containing both benevolence and cruelty are vividly depicted.  When the war ends relationships are re-established and shattered families are reunited.Although the book is filled with tragedy, war, dislocation, and death, I never viewed it as a tragedy.  It was an eventful look at the vagaries of life as experienced by this family.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CO0TWPXCEZC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375758771#wasThisHelpful","R2CO0TWPXCEZC9","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE LIGHT IN THE RUINS REVIEWChris Bohjalian has written an intriguing novel about a period in history that has often been overlooked.  In “The Light in the Ruins” he takes us to Italy at a time when Nazi Germany was currying favor with its hesitant ally.  Neither country was enamored with the other and relationships were tense and cautious.  It was a contentious and eventful time that has been only lightly explored.In 1943 the prominent Rosati family of Tuscany was confident their grand villa would protect them and garner favor from the greedy German forces that were gradually intruding on Italy and its citizens. Theft of national treasures and needed crops was commonplace.  Despite early benevolence extended to the interlopers, confrontations eventually occur, the villa and its ancient tombs are decimated, and the Rosatis fall to disfavor with both the Germans and their own Italian countrymen.Jumping forward to 1955, the story picks up with the brutal slayings and heinous dismemberments of Rosati family members by an unknown assailant.  Serafina Bettini, a Florence police investigator, who still suffers from horrendous burns received during the war, is assigned to the gruesome case.  She promptly finds herself immersed in family disorder and unpleasant memories as she pursues the serial killer who is determined to slay the entire clan.  Serafina discovers she has a personal relationship with the maniacal murderer.Bohjalian knows how to tell a story that’s full of historical and well-researched detail that doesn’t dull down the narrative.  The reader can fully appreciate how history can embellish the storyline and bring realism to the action.  His characterizations, while numerous, are clearly defined.In my opinion, there were several characters that could have been eliminated in favor of a shorter and less tedious read, but many authors like the sound of their own words and have no intention of being pithy.  That said, “The Light” remains a great book by an equally great writer.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15SXD0YTHTCHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307743926#wasThisHelpful","R15SXD0YTHTCHZ","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TIBETAN CROSS REVIEWI am always totally exhausted after reading a Mike Bond novel.  “Tibetan Cross” is no exception.  The frenetic action, convoluted character interactions, deep meanderings of the mind, and heavily flavored scenic descriptions are almost too much to handle.Bond’s encyclopedic knowledge of the exotic places to which he takes us is overwhelming.  Throw in his familiarity with local politics, governmental peculiarities, attitudes towards hostilities and the use of weapons, and the makings of fine fiction are in place.  All Bond has to do is assemble the information that churns in his brain and another book is born.  His biography sums it all up.  His novels “depict the terror and fury of battle and the intense joy of love, the beauty of the natural world, and the nature of the universe and its many meanings for human life.”Bond has never met an adjective he doesn’t love.  Scratch a few from his novels and his stories would be much shorter and easier to read.  But, setting that foible aside, the reader is treated to intricate plots, splendid settings, characters that resonate, and nonstop action.In “Tibetan Cross” a Himalayan climber gets involved in backpack nuclear weapons and is chased all over Asia, North Africa, Europe and the United States, along with a beautiful woman he happens to pick up (and who can apparently suffer through his never ending unkempt and smelly semblance), by the CIA and other assorted nefarious agencies.  Extermination is, of course, the intent.  Bond, as always, pulls the fragmented story together into a sort of resolution at the end.IF you like action, exotic places, and tough guys always on the run, Mike Bond can provide great entertainment.  Be prepared, however, for an out of breath and sometimes-quizzical adventure.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9QSUSK8WZCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5BU52S#wasThisHelpful","R1W9QSUSK8WZCT","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TEXAS VIGILANTE REVIEWBill Crider has penned a rather traditional western, ""Texas Vigilante,"" full of revenge, cowards, stalwarts, and strong women.  I was somewhat taken aback by the cover, a cowgirl in Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses, not the typical face I'd expect from the 1880s, but I was better pleased by what I read.The sequel to another novel, ""Outrage at Blanco,"" heroine Ellie Train sets out to bring justice to a band of brutal killers, a skill she learned after she was raped and left for dead in ""Outrage.""  She is relentless, unafraid, and focused as she seeks retribution once again.Crider is a skilled writer, leaning towards both westerns and crime novels.  He's won many awards and best book nominations for his some 75 novels, and if thrilling western action is to your liking, this effort will be appreciated.  The action is non-stop and realistically presented; the dialogue is crisp and well written.  The characterizations are skillfully prepared with the bad guys being bad and the good guys believable and likeable.There is no need to review the story, it's been told many times. The book's appeal is in the writer's skill.  I had some minor discomfort with the seemingly never-ending bad choices made by the protagonists, but the story is carried through this parade of situations, even if some seem contrived.  This is a minor complaint, not enough to squelch my enthusiasm for the book.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJD6A3SK9T8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAJX6BQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IJD6A3SK9T8Z","A2IOQZR1KNFNJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IOQZR1KNFNJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a world where simple niceties are often abandoned or neglected, author Steve Antony reminds us that if you want to be treated nicely, you need to be a nice person. Antony's book, PLEASE, MR. PANDA, reminds young children of the benefits of being polite, specifically the importance of magic words (please and thank you).The book also illustrates the power words can give. It would be swell if one could read it to a child once and the child became socially aware, however, adults reading to children need to use their words to reenforce Mr. Panda's lesson (raising children offers many opportunities).Young children should enjoy the bold black and white animal illustrations as well as the mystery of Mr. Panda's not-too-perplexing mind changes.

The included book is actually a board book, not a flimsy 8-pager that will fall apart after a few readings. I have no complaints about the toy, but the storage box, oddly enough, does not include a cover, which cuts down on the practicality and portability of T.S. Shure ArchiQuest Wooden Farm Blocks. The box is simply a wooden box with no compartments and no lid to keep the pieces from straying when the toy is moved around. I expected that it would have a clear plastic cover similar to other sets from T.S. Shure. Luckily, the box is deep enough for me to be able to throw all the pieces in without having to arrange them, but it isn't stackable (unless it's the top piece in the pile).

"Nope. One of the things I really want in a printer is one that does not tear through ink cartridges so quickly that three or four cartridge changes cost more than the printer itself. I realize that the cartridges are the money makers, not the printers, but gee whiz, I'd be happy to pay more for a printer that didn't just zip through the ink. Obviously what this is leading up to is that this is a prodigal printer: it very generously applies ink to the page, actually quite a bit more than is needed. That may be why it seems the print cartridges empty so quickly, but my impression is that the cartridges do not hold as much ink as those for other printers I have used. The print quality is no better than my HP printers, another disappointment. Another problem, and this is definitely my fault, is that the printer is much bigger than I expected. Since I wanted it specifically for my tablets and cell phone, I somehow expected it would be smaller. I realize that is a strange expectation, but I don't have room for a printer this large. I forgot to check the dimensions of the printer before I ordered it, and wanted something much more compact. Although this printer has lots of bells and whistles, it doesn't offer the basics I need.

Well, I guess all bubble gum smells artificial since bubble gum doesn't actually grow in gardens or forests. Whatever. The point is that this Duck Tape smells amazingly like the bubble gum of my youth, not one of the many fruity flavors now available. It is also more pliable than those sticks of bubble gum that came with trading cards. I do wonder if whatever makes it smell so good should keep me from ripping the tape with my teeth, though. Although I thought this product would be okay for kids, who else would need it or spend the extra $$$ just for the scent and color, I think it would be great as a gift-wrapping accent. I also wonder how long the scent lasts once the package is open and the tape is applied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NUF4YWHBHVT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MF1BZHE#wasThisHelpful","R2NUF4YWHBHVT7","AHQ13I9CI4US6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHQ13I9CI4US6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! You think you know your cats and then they throw you a curve ball of yarn. The cat population at our home varies; there have been as many as four, right now there are two. Trying to find a cat food they would all eat, we settled on DeliCat, which was amazingly successful in appealing to all our cats. Last weekend, we took a short trip, and left the cats home with a huge portion of DeliCat and a large bowl of 9 Lives Lean and Tasty Dry Cat Food. Much to my surprise, when we got home we found that our little darlings had devoured the 9 Lives! I had expected they would turn their noses up at it because it's ""lean,"" and, like our kids, anything that hints to be in any way healthful is to be avoided at all costs (including starvation). Maybe it's because the individual pieces are smaller (and aren't so much ""work""), maybe it's because Morris is their idol, or maybe it's because our cats are contrarians--we don't know why, but we do know that the cats seem to like this stuff. Who knows? Maybe it's as ""tasty"" as 9 Lives claims.

"Different grandmothers have different styles of grandparenting. For example, my grandmother used to be sure to put us to bed VERY early, and she chased my brother around the house with a broom (probably the one she arrived on). Her idea of interacting with children was to eat with them, tell them when to bathe and go to bed, and administer discipline as needed. I only met my other grandmother once, when I was 4; she lived on the west coast and apparently did not have a burning desire to spend time with her east coast family. On the other hand, I like to have toys and art projects around for my grandkids, and I enjoy assisting and interacting with them. Since we have four dogs, the ALEX Toys - Craft, Color a Dog House Children's Kit, seemed like a good project that I could work on with my two granddaughters (ages 6 and 9). Rather than allowing them to fight over who was going to do what, I assembled the dog house, and they decorated it. What an easy project! The coloring kept them entertained, and they felt like they were creating something that would actually be used. Our dogs aren't too keen on doghouses, so this one will probably end up being a cat house. We have always had good experiences with Alex toys, and this one is no exception. I would suggest letting the kids decorate the house BEFORE assembling, if possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QZ3COOA3D7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYW4A94#wasThisHelpful","R2QZ3COOA3D7O","AHQ13I9CI4US6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHQ13I9CI4US6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the south, handypersons believe there's nothing that can't be fixed with duct tape, and I'm sure that philosophy could be applied to the DII Real Tree Insulated Cooler/Lunch Bag. However, one should not have to repair a lunchbag fresh out of the package, and although lunchbags are rather informal, it's just not my style to be toting one patched together with duct tape (I have to save my duct tape in case something happens to my car or window screens). What am I saying? My DII Real Tree Insulated Cooler/Lunch Bag arrived with four continuous inches of ravelled, loose thread (now I know where that pickle went), and missed stitches here and there (mostly there). It is probably a good lunchbag if you're trying to cut calories because you will lose half your lunch on the way to wherever you go to eat it. It's flimsy and poorly made, although it's not unpleasant to look at. I was looking forward to trying it out at an all-day event where I have to bring my own refreshments, such as an amateur tractor-pull or livestock auction. Unfortunately that is not to be (unless I find coordinating duct tape). One thing I do like about it is it's a nice size and could probably accomodate a six-pack with room to spare (for pork rinds and beef jerky).

"It's cute, it's fun to build, and it's definitely not for those with ADD or ADHD. The Time Machine Building Set isn't much more than a one-trick pony--you assemble it, and then what? You put it on a shelf and admire it? You take it apart and put it together repeatedly? Fans of ""Family Guy"" may find it to be a ""collector's item,"" but as a toy for kids in general, uh-uh. And here's what happens when a kid has ADD or ADHD: several pieces are put together, the kid gets bored, asks for help, expects the ""helper"" to do the rest of the work, and then the kid ignores it. Forever. Yeah, the kid loves ""Family Guy,"" but probably a ""Family Guy"" stuffed toy would be a better choice. (I am not making fun of kids with ADHD; I am speaking from experience.)Verdict: if you love ""Family Guy"" (who doesn't) so much that you collect ""Family Guy"" memorabilia, or know someone who does, then this is a good choice, an item to be assembled and become part of a ""Family Guy"" collection.

"For those of you who read The Education of Caroline, Semper Fi is the hero, US Marine Sebastian Hunter's side of the story. Lovers of forbidden love and second chances will enjoy this romantic tale. Having fallen in love with Jane Harvey-Berrick's Traveling Man Series, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to read more of her writing. While arguably, Semper Fi does have a very different feel, particularly given that it is told from a marine's perspective--and his past experiences as a marine, not too mention his prior forbidden encounters with the heroine as teenager, necessarily color the way he has lived, and how he views life--this story nonetheless shares with the Traveling Man Series that angsty feeling between two lovers who are constantly trying to fight the polar opposite forces that coming from two different walks of life necessarily exposes them to.Ten years ago Sebastian fell in love with a married woman, Caroline, 13 years his senior. Their undeniable attraction came to an abrupt halt once their secret was exposed, but Caroline has continued to be a preeminent presence in Sebastian's heart and thoughts throughout the past decade. A decade that he has spent as a marine and engaging in wild debauchery in an angry attempt to get over Caroline.Now a marine stationed at a desk job in Geneva, as a punishment of sorts for his wild behavior, he comes across none other than Caroline, who is working as a reporter and is ready to travel to Afghanistan. Caroline is now long divorced, but married to her job as a military correspondent. As Caroline waits for her clearance to travel, Sebastian finds it his perfect opportunity to see what might have been. But can you ever truly get a second chance at true love?At first I was worried that I might be a bit lost without reading the first two books. No doubt I imagine that reading the first two books would have been helpful to help frame the tragic circumstances that led to their initial separation, but I had no trouble following the story line without this prior experience.All in all, if you are looking for an emotional journey of the hard road to second love glory, then Semper Fi may be a good choice for your next read.Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFSVSKYH8L6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VIALM2#wasThisHelpful","R2BFSVSKYH8L6F","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 ""The Bluestocking & Lord Sweet Cheeks"" Stars! If you're looking for a short and fun historical romance, then One Moonlit Night may just be the book you've been looking for. I loved the depth of the characters and entertaining banter between the hero and the heroine. Moreover, the book pokes fun at the double standard prevalent between men and women in the Regency era without coming across as too political. By pitting two characters together, each who have sworn off marriage (for vastly different reasons), Ms. Foley brings together two characters who are perfectly matched without all the distractions of courtship that were so tedious in the day. The premise and execution were excellent and I highly enjoyed this little treasure.After numerous failed courtship attempts, Lady Katrina Glendon, the oldest of a brood of sisters, has finally given up her quest for marriage and has decided to wholeheartedly embrace the spinster life. Of course this news comes much to the elation of the gaggle of sisters who had been waiting for her, as the oldest, to marry first before they could tie their knot.Katrina too seems happy with her decision until a certain well-known rake, Gable Winston-McCray, a Viscount and heir to an Earl, and who she has coined ""Lord Sweet Cheeks,"" takes her into his confidence and proclaims his desire to be ""friends."" As the two start depending on each other more and more as their friendship blossoms, each begins to see the brighter side of marriage. But can two people who have sworn off marriage, ever consider changing their destiny?What a treat! One Moonlit Night is the novella prequel to the Moonlight Square Series, a new historical romance Regency series which will tell the romantic stories of the residents of the exclusive, upper crust Moonlit Square. With the very promising start of One Moonlight Night, which has introduced a number of secondary characters who will no doubt form the basis for further entertaining romantic reads, I'm now looking forward to reading more of this series!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYT9NN7CQBW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AOHBQG#wasThisHelpful","R1YYT9NN7CQBW3","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovers of dark romance will not want to miss King by T.M. Frazier. This book grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept me enraptured throughout. Combining the perfect mix between suspense and an erotically-charged, forbidden-tinged romance, King was a hit for me. However, please note this book is not for the faint of heart. It contains disturbing subjects, including violence, abuse and an extremely possessive, badboy, alpha hero. Additionally, King ends in a huge cliffhanger, so if you want the full story you will need to listen to the sequel, Tyrant, to learn how it all ends. Fortunately, both Molly Glenmore and Rob Shapiro do a great job with the narration, and are returning for Tyrant.

Instead, this story provides a real glimpse into the difficulties and challenges of competitive sports, the loneliness of being at the top of one’s field, and the essential nature of having true friends. What an unexpected hidden gem. I truly can’t recommend this listen highly enough. Whether you love sports or not, it is sure to provide a completely different perspective to fame and fortune, striving for perfection and the true things that bring joy to our lives.See the full review at AudioGals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W062P6XN0GUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LXW9D0#wasThisHelpful","R3W062P6XN0GUT","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret that I am a huge fan of Joanna Wylde's MC romances of which I have read or listened to nearly every single one. So when I saw Painter's story was coming out, I was ecstatic. For those of you who read Devil's Game, Painter is the playboy Reaper's biker that Em (the daughter of the Reaper's MC's President--Picnic) had a crush on before she falls in love with Hunter from the Devil's Jack MC.We also have met our heroine, Melanie Tucker, in past Reaper's MC books. Melanie is Jessica's best friend. Given her close connection to Jessica, her aunt, London (Picnic's Old Lady) has always treated Melanie like a daughter. Which suits Melanie just fine as she is in need of a female role model given her own tragic family background--particularly that her mom just up and left her (and her drunk abusive Dad) one day.As you can imagine being like a daughter to the MC President's Old Lady, and younger to boot, Melanie was strictly off limits to a Reapers MC brother. However, all the rules in the world couldn't help Painter's internal thoughts when it came to Melanie. Then the Reaper's MC outlaw life catches up with him and lands him in prison. And guess who starts writing to him? None other than Melanie. Painter tries to ward her off--even going so far as to suggest that she date--but fate has other plans.In typical Joanna Wylde fashion, Reaper's Fall delivers some super, hot MC style erotic scenes. Moreover, the dirty talking internal monologues where Painter voices what he'd like to do with Melanie are simply off the charts. There is just something so wickedly appealing about the gritty and alpha way that Joanna Wylde's hero's voice their needs and wants and how they treat their heroines. There is also a fair bit of suspense as the Reaper's club gets involved in trying to prevent the internal overtaking of an ally club and the residual effects of living the outlaw life.However, all in all, I do have to admit that while good, Reaper's Fall was not my favorite Joanna Wylde romance. I think perhaps this may be due to the fact that (view spoiler) Oh how I do love a Joanna Wylde MC hero when he goes into alpha hero mode! And again I will be sitting on pins and needles for the next Joanna Wylde MC romance!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3X8HYUSYF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R3G3X8HYUSYF8","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good pair of earphones is indispensable to an avid audiobook listener. Last year alone I listened to over 70 audiobooks and, on average, I listen to one to two audiobooks a week.As you can imagine, as such a frequent audiobook listener, who wears her earphones everywhere–from the gym to in my home when I’m cleaning or relaxing in bed (and even to bed when I’m falling asleep!), I frequently go through earphones as they inevitably break. So I am happy to report that my experience with the Brainwavz M2 In-Ear Headphones has been great!From the sturdy packaging in which it was shipped, which ensured that my earphones arrived in perfect condition, to the functionality and high quality of the earphones themselves, I have been very happy with the Brainwavz M2 In-Ear Headphones.A few features that I particularly have enjoyed include:1. The great enhanced sound quality, which allows me to sit back and enjoy my audiobooks, including all the subtle variations between character intonations which make audiobook listening seamless without having to rely on textual references to understand which character is speaking (ie, for you audiobook lovers, “dialogue tags”);2. The thin and light and yet surprisingly tangle-free cord!  I can’t tell you the amount of time I take up disentangling other earphone cords as they inevitably always end up tangled.  Not the Brainwavz In-Ear Headphone cord!  I haven’t had to detangle it once!  Moreover, not only is it tangle-free, but it also has a great long-length which means that I never have to worry about my i-Phone or i-Pod falling when I’m working out and I rest the device on the cardio equipment;3. The earplugs are one of the best fitting earplugs I have ever used!  They fit perfectly in my ear allowing me to concentrate on my housework or workout rather than constantly having to readjust them (as is frequently the case with some of the other earphones I have tried;4. The attractive and sturdy case they came in, which is big enough to hold all of the accessories too; and5. The attractive metallic and black color that gives the earphones a really sleek look with equally matching audio quality to match!All in all, I am very satisfied with my Brainwavz M2 In-Ear Headphones and would certainly consider buying similar earphones from Brainwavz in the future.Source:  Product provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTWDYB4M10T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I5FL1G#wasThisHelpful","R2DTWDYB4M10T7","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read each and every one of the Burying Water Series and have greatly enjoyed them all.  Without a doubt, KA Tucker is very talented romantic suspense writer.  Surviving Ice is no different.Throughout this series we had gotten a peak at the tough-shelled, tatted heroine Ivy, so I had been eager to hear her story.  And what a story it is!  Moreover, I was equally pleased to find that the assassin for hire hero, who works for a private security firm that does clandestine government style missions, had an equally compelling story to tell.  Perhaps the only sad point of this book, is that it is the last of the series.  I for one wish there were more books to come, but I'm sure no matter what KA Tucker chooses to write next, it will be equally as compelling and engrossing as this series has been.Ivy is back in San Francisco.  She is living with her uncle and working at his tattoo shop.  Thinking she just might finally have found a place she wants to stay put in for a while, she is blind sighted by what happens next.  Her witnessing of a gruesome crime--her uncle's murder.Following that, she is desperate to move on, but left with no choice but to clean up her uncle's shop and prepare his shop and home for sale.  It is during this transition period that Ivy meets the secretive, but sexy Sebastian. And that questions begin to arise as to exactly why her uncle was murdered.Sebastian is on a mission.  One of many that he has undertaken at the hands of the private, clandestine security firm that he works for.  Never being in one place for long, and doing the jobs that he assumes the public never really wants to know occur to maintain the peace, comes easy to this former Navy Seal.  But he has finally been given a mission that he feels like he must question.When things are not quite what they seem, what will the fiercely independent, Ivy and military trained commando, Sebastian, choose to do?  Will they be able to fight their natural inclinations to take flight, in the case of Ivy, and follow orders, in the case of Sebastian; or, will they for the first time in their lives fight for something that could mean so much more?Entertaining and enthralling, lovers of suspense titles will be captivated by the suspenseful plot of this story.  At the same time, the romance between this--somewhat unlikely and yet equally explosive--pair is sure to keep your romance lust sated.Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4LAC43DMFQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNHQO#wasThisHelpful","R1E4LAC43DMFQO","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This title had been sitting on my Audible account for a long time, and I decided to give myself a little UF treat for Halloween.  In typical UF style, Book 1 only begins to scratch the surface of both the UF suspense and romance arc.  And this is a long series with at least 8 full-length books plus several novellas to date and more planned for the future, so this a book which you should only undertake, if you are prepared to commit to a long, yet to be completed series.Somewhat of a cross between a Molly Harper title (in the humor department) and Karen Robard's Dr. Charlotte Stone Series (in the UF, grim reaper/crime solving subject matter), First Grave on the Right is an interesting mix that I had heard great things about.  While I found it to be a little overloaded with tangential humor, the suspense and romantic arc are appealing and definitely piqued my interest.  However, through out I did find myself having to power through some of the overloaded unrelated humor, to sift through to my preferred parts (the suspense/romance).  Therefore, I recommend this series for UF lovers who are also fans of chicklit style romances.One of the brightest parts of this audiobook was the narration by Lorelei King.  Ms. King hit all the factors that I look for in a good narrator.  Both her male and female characters sounded genuine, and had distinguishable intonations from one another to allow for easy listening without having to rely on dialogue tags.  Ms. King also held a great pace that made listening seamless.  Additionally, she did a marvelous job with portraying the mood of the scene in natural way without having it seem overly dramatic or flat.  I will definitely be looking for more of Ms. King's narrations in the future.Source:  Personally purchased copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9BRZE6S1PFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LQ6M60#wasThisHelpful","R2K9BRZE6S1PFS","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’re looking for a cross between a tough, alpha law enforcement type of romance and a wolf shifter novel, then Wolf Trouble (SWAT: Special Wolf Alpha Team #2) is sure to hit the right spot. The action in this fast-paced SWAT team based book reminded me a lot of some well liked romantic suspense series, like Laura Kaye’s Hard Ink series, while the focus on the enhancements and the particular life-changing effects of learning and coping with being a shifter reminded me of one of my favorite PNR series, the Seven series by Dannika Dark. Moreover, the timing couldn’t be better to read a PNR with Halloween just around the corner! However, don’t fret if you aren’t into overly scary listens, as Wolf Trouble is relatively light in the fear factor quotient and is instead much more focused on the suspense, action and unique romantic imprinting capabilities of wolf shifters.I was also pleasantly surprised to find, that unlike many other PNR Series, Wolf Trouble can be read as a stand-alone. Not only was the romance between the hero and heroine fully contained within this book, but even the action/suspense was completely explained and resolved. From a world-building perspective, while I got the impression that some of the characters and the special capabilities of the wolf shifters had been explained in book 1 (Hungry Like the Wolf), I had no difficulty understanding this aspect of the listen either.See the full review at AudioGals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKAL2FJOIJ1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BQ47IG#wasThisHelpful","RJKAL2FJOIJ1S","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’re looking for a completely original storyline, and love all sub-genres of romance, then I highly recommend the Dr. Charlotte Stone series by Karen Robards. Equal parts paranormal, thriller, mystery, romance and even a touch of humor, this series is sure to have something for everyone as long as you love fantasy style romances. In that regard, I will note that a large part of the plot in this series requires you to suspend belief long enough to accept that ghosts exist and that there are some humans who can interact with or hear their remnants.For those of you who are not familiar with this series, please also note that the The Last Time I Saw Her is the fourth and last book. Although each book contains a different central serial killer case which must be solved, the romance arc develops over the entire series, and therefore for maximum enjoyment the books should be read in chronological order starting with Book 1, The Last Victim. Additionally, I suggest that you not read my review beyond the next two paragraphs which generally explain the series. After the fourth paragraph, where I describe the background of The Last Time I Saw Her, in particular, you may find spoilers for some of the earlier books.See the full review at AudioGals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MX3MV44WDXMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ETA2KG#wasThisHelpful","R3MX3MV44WDXMN","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Historical romance lovers of improbable matches between two members of opposite classes will enjoy The Rogue You Know.  I'm so accustomed to historical romances always featuring a hero who is a duke or some other sort of titled upper class designation that I was instantly attracted to the thought of a story where a lady falls for a commoner, and a thief (an original bad boy) no less.Although this is the second book in the Covent Garden Cubs series, it can easily be read as a standalone as the romance between the hero and heroine is fully contained within this story.  That said if you read Earls Just Want to Have Fun, you will be pleased to know that Marlowe and Maxwell make a reappearance in The Rogue You Know.We first meet our hero, Gideon Harrow, in the streets where he has spent most of his life as a thief and a con.  He is a good friend of Marlowe's having both belonged to a gang of thieves living in the London slums.  He is presently on the run, having stolen a very valuable necklace, which he hopes will be his ticket out of the outlaw life he leads, and in an attempt to find Marlowe, and hide his stash, he finds himself at the house of Marlowe's sister-in-law, Lady Susanna Derring.Susanna, the daughter of an Earl, has spent her life living in London's high privileged society.  Constantly chastised by her mother, who is on an ever ending plight to find her a suitable match.  In the process, Susanna has felt like she has missed out on life, never being able to do the things she really wants to do.  One of which is visit Vauxhall Gardens.When Susanna interrupts Gideon in his attempt to hide the necklace in her home after breaking in, she ceases her opportunity to get out and experience life for once.  In that regard, she proposes a trade, she will return the necklace to Gideon if he takes her Vauxhall Gardens.So begins Susanna's and Gideon's wild journey which will take them from the London's underworld to the discovery of their own secret wishes and desires, never mind the truth behind one of their families.  But even if during this crazy adventure they share forbidden experiences, will society ever truly allow a thief and a lady find a a HEA together?While I do have to say that the beginning of this book felt a little bit cliched, particularly when it came to heroine, who initially came across as completely naive trusting a thief to protect her on her journey, the story does eventually embrace depth and became an addicting read. Moreover, there are some unexpected plot twists mixed in which keep the reader on their toes.  In addition, to a compelling romance between two characters who both seem to grow up and mature in the process of discovering each other and themselves in the process.All in all, The Rogue You Know was an enjoyable romance and I look forward to exploring more of the Covent Garden Cubs Series.Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDAIE20UAL6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402298749#wasThisHelpful","RPDAIE20UAL6V","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while, I’m in the mood for a light, funny romance that will help reset my typically darker, romantic suspense laden palate. When I pushed play on The Hooker and the Hermit, that was exactly the kind of listen I was looking for, and this audiobook fit the bill perfectly! I definitely chuckled at LH Cosway’s and Penny Reid’s plentiful comical lines that were full of sexual innuendos and double entendres. I also reveled in watching the heroine, a social recluse at the beginning of the story, blossom and become more comfortable with her in-person social interactions, as I ate up the plentiful alpha moments where the dominant, Irish rugby star “hooker” got to exhibit his alpha hero tendencies.Perhaps what surprised me the most, though, was a somewhat less than vanilla, BDSM theme that was woven into the story. Though tasteful, and very light in nature, it just caught me largely by surprise, as I was not expecting an erotic listen from the blurb. If you don’t mind a little light dominance with your romance, however, The Hooker and the Hermit is a witty romantic comedy with an above-average narration, making it a good audiobook choice.To see the full review, see AudioGals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB5ISZ3G9EKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDYQTTA#wasThisHelpful","R2OB5ISZ3G9EKH","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 “Falling for a Killer?” Stars!Romantic suspense lovers with a particular captivation for CSI forensics style crime tracking skills will be be sitting on the edge of their seats to finish Shadow Fall! One note of warning though, for romantic suspense lovers who thrive on the passion or romance angle of the read, please note that the emphasis in this novel is on the action-packed suspense driven plot.For those of you who are wondering whether Shadow Fall can be read as a standalone, this being my first Tracers’ Series novel, I can honestly say that it stands completely on its own as both the specific criminal, which is the focus of the suspense, and the romance is fully contained with the book. All that said, my curiousity has now been piqued to challenge my sleuthing skills with prior Tracers novels! The suspense angle of this series is that spell binding!Special FBI Agent Tara Rushing receives the typical share of resistance from the local authorities in the small town in Texas that she is sent to to investigate a high profile murder of a former political hopeful. Found brutally mutilated in the woods, the female victim, who at one time was the client of former marine, turned security expert, entrepreneur, Liam Wolfe, is the kind of high profile case that can’t be ignored. After a little digging, however, it becomes clear to Tara that they have something much bigger than just a single homicide. Instead, they are undoubtedly looking at the work of a serial killer who is in the process of escalating his attacks.Moreover, the serial killer is no novice to the law. Clearly, they are dealing with a government or law trained professional who knows exactly how to wipe all evidence traces. The local authorities, led by their sheriff, have their own suspicions, and Liam Wolff is at the top of their suspect list.Tara, however, is not so convinced. Moreover, what she feels when she’s near Liam is something altogether different: a strong attraction. Liam is a suspect on a case she is working on, so completely off limits. However, she can hardly ignore him when he is willing to lend his expertise in both the crime investigation and other areas to Tara. Is Liam just trying to throw her off the trail of a brutal serial killer though, or is he truly trying to help with both the case and Tara’s personal well being?All in all, Shadow Fall was a suspenseful, riveting read. I inevitably kept coming back to my Kindle hoping to solve both the case and Liam’s true motivations. Lovers of romantic suspense titles will love exercising their thought-provoking crime skills while devouring Shadow Fall.Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQW55736GJN40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476779252#wasThisHelpful","RQW55736GJN40","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Proving that not all Motorcycle Clubs (MCs) or bikers, for that matter, are alike, Beyond the Cut, Book 2 in Sarah Castille’s Sinner’s Tribe Motorcycle Club series, provides an interesting comparison between the “good,” if not necessarily completely law abiding, MCs and the “bad” MCs. Beyond the Cut also straddles the line between a light and dark romance, covering some of the typical dark romance themes that are prevalent in the MC romance sub-genre, including domestic violence, without being so overly descriptive as to alienate some of the more adventurous, mainstream romance listeners. As for the erotic content that typically is synonymous with this sub-genre, well, there is plenty of that – so much so, that I did find myself fast-forwarding through a couple of the scenes. This MC romance also sports a complementary, above-average narration by Chandra Skyye, whose performance helps bring this story to life.See the full review at AudioGals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKC2XPTPO3CGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250056616#wasThisHelpful","RKC2XPTPO3CGM","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’re looking for a feel good, “maid for the cowboy” romance where the big, tall and handsome, and – did I mention – rich, cowboy comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress, then look no further. Sporting one admirable alpha hero, with one undeniable protective streak, When I’m Gone will leave you with the feeling that every heroine, no matter how desperate and down on her luck, is just one hero away from having all her problems solved. Further complementing this happy romance is a solid performance by both Grace Grant and Jason Carpenter.Two items of caution: First, while the romance is happy, the heroine’s background is not. In fact, as a teenager she is subject to some pretty serious physical and mental abuse at the hands of her step-father and mother, some of which is painfully described at the beginning of the book. Therefore, if this is a trigger for you, this may not be the right listen for you. Second, When I’m Gone is the eleventh book in the Rosemary Beach Series by Abbi Glines. Although most contemporary romance series function perfectly fine as standalones, as you can imagine, after such a large number of books, quite an intricate web of relationships and prior experiences necessarily color the tight community and Manning family which features so prominently in this series. Therefore, while not absolutely necessary (because enough of the background is briefly summarized) I will note that since I had not listened to the prior books in the series, I did feel a little bit at a loss in a number of the passages that featured a strong influence by previously introduced characters.For the full review, see AudioGals*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N34TWSZ3639K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OO0C#wasThisHelpful","R1N34TWSZ3639K","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you loved the Traveling Duet (Traveling Man/Traveling Woman), you will not want to miss Tucker McCoy's and Tera Hawkins' story. Tucker is one of the other three motorcycle stunt riders that travels with Kes in the carnival circuit, and Tera is Kes' recently discovered half sister who was raised by his estranged father the Senator. Roustabout has the same angst filled, heart wrenching emotional quality that I fell in love with in the Traveling Man/Traveling Woman, and that only a true star crossed lovers romance can draw out. While the facts are slightly different here, its another inspiring romance that allows you to root for the underdog and ultimately proves that true love can transcend anything, including class differences.For those of you who are wondering if Roustabout can be read as a standalone, the answer is yes. While it is helpful to have read, Traveling 1 and 2, to put the carnival life and the various secondary characters in context; strictly speaking, Roustabout can be read as a standalone, as the romance between Tucker and Tera is fully contained within this book.After one emotionally scarring experience, Tucker discovered that women are best enjoyed in a non-serious relationship. His exceptional flirtatious manner, and ability to smile in the face of adversity combined with his demanding physical regime, further prime him as the perfect candidate to charm nearly any woman. Moreover, his life on the carnival circuit, which began as a roustabout (a general carnival jack of all trades) and which now has turned into the more coveted position of a motorcycle stunt man--has never been conducive to anything longer than a night (or two) anyway.Tera is enjoying getting to know her brother Kes, visiting him often at the carnivals he is performing at when time off from her busy career allows. It is during one of those visits that she first sets her sights on Tucker. Though she knows Tucker's reputation, she is determined to have her own, at least, one night of pleasure with this man who elicits a reaction in her like no other.As soon as Tucker, learns who she is (Kes' sister) though, he starts avoiding her though he's equally as tempted. Just as it appears that Tera may be wearing Tucker down though, a blast from the past comes back into Tucker's life that threatens it all. As if that weren't enough to contend with, Tera's protective and rich father and mother are equally determined to ensure that Tera, who is ever in the political spotlight due to her Senator father's political ambitions, date a man worthy of the political spotlight. Then, of course there is Kes and Aimee, who are protective of his Kes' sister, and who know Tucker's proclivities when it comes to women. Do Tera and Tucker possibly stand a chance among this avalanche of obstacles?All in all, Roustabout is another hit for Jane Harvey-Berrick. I can't wait to read more of Ms. Harvey-Berrick's evocative writing in the future!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QELRAW6NLL3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01391R3GK#wasThisHelpful","R3QELRAW6NLL3C","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the Seven Series have undoubtedly been waiting on pins and needles for Denver's story.  Well we finally get to see if there is more to his relationship with Maizy.  As Maizy's childhood watchdog (a supernatural being who becomes a protector to a human child), we frequently got to see the unique bond between Denver and Maizy; and Denver's extreme protective nature towards her.  In this sixth installation of the Seven Series, we finally get to see what happens when a grown-up Maizy no longer needs a watchdog.As you can imagine, and as is typical with most paranormal/urban fantasy romance series, Two Minutes is best enjoyed after having experienced the prior five books.  Particularly as it relates to Denver and Maizy, who have figured prominently in the background stories of all the prior books in the series, it would be difficult to fully understand the background of their story without reading or listening to this series in chronological order.  All that said, given the time difference in Two Minutes versus the prior books, the adult relationship between these two characters is entirely contained in this book, and therefore the romance/love story of this book can be read as a stand-alone.  Of course, there is also an intricate PNR/UF arc that has been built over the prior books, including at least one crucial secondary character, that you will also have a limited view of, if you only read or listen to this book.Maizy has just returned from England where, at the insistence of her family she has spent the last few years acclimating to living with solely humans, after having been raised her entire childhood in the Weston Wolf Pack.  During these years away she has been particularly estranged from Denver, though not for her lack of trying.  Yet, he always seemed to be mysteriously absent when she called back home or even on the occasion when the Pack came out to visit her while away.  Maizy misses her special relationship with Denver and now that she is back home, she is determined to reestablish that connection again.Denver, in turn, has purposefully been evading Maizy.  Her departure brought to the forefront her mortal nature, and he knows that eventually he will lose her too and has determined that it is better to distance himself now.  However, Maizy, is not the same girl who left the Weston Pack all those years ago, and his mistaking her for his blind date upon her return only begins to spark the tip of the iceberg as to his attraction to this grown-up version of the girl he has always vowed to protect.Maizy, however, has also caught the eye of another, much more powerful and rich suitor, and he is determined to make Maizy his mate for reasons that most of the Weston Pack is unaware of.  Who will Maizy ultimately align her future with?  Will she even have a choice?Nicole Poole, as always, renders a fabulous performance in Two Minutes.  Evidencing incredible consistency in her voicing of the various characters, Ms. Poole once again brings together this eclectic cast of shifters and, in a few cases, the humans they love.Showing incredible depth, Ms. Poole also manages to keep the same general intonation she has always used for Maizy's childhood voice but convincingly adds some depth and maturity to portray what a grown-up version of Maizy should sound like.In addition to her great range with being able to bring together personality specific voices for each member of the large Seven Series cast, Ms. Poole also does a fantastic job of timing her delivery so as to draw the maximum effect from her listeners.  From the fast paced, action-filled scenes, to the slower more emotional ones, you can always count on Ms. Poole to bring this story to life in a dynamic, true to the script way.All in all, Two Minutes is another superb addition to the Seven Series.  Without a doubt this series has become one of my favorite PNR/UF audiobook series of all time!Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCN99XHDB6RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RK2JHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VCN99XHDB6RN","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently tried the Brainwavz BLU-100 Sport Bluetooth 4.0 APTX Headphones and loved them!  Being an avid audiobook listener I'm always looking for ways to make my listening experience easier.  I had previously tried other bluetooth headphones but was disappointed with how difficult they were to sync to my iPod and iPhone.  The Brainwavz bluetooth headphones, however, were amazingly easy to connect, and have delivered excellent sound quality, commensurate with the same quality as that which I am accustomed to with my standard cord earbuds.  Moreover, with the Brainwavz bluetooth headphones, I no longer have to worry about messy cords getting tangled and getting in my way while I'm enjoying my audiobooks at the gym or while doing housework at home.  It's also much easier to be able to lay my iPod or iPhone on a surface (as the headphones can pick up the sound from as far away as 30 feet), without having to be forced to constantly carry the iPod or iPhone while also doing my workout or cleaning and cooking.Basically, I charge my headphones overnight, by connecting them to my computer, with the charging cord provided, and then I'm good to go for the next day's morning visit to the gym.  The battery life is about 2 hours which works perfectly with my workouts.  My headphones haven't run out of battery yet!  Then when I get home I recharge them for any other listening time I plan to use throughout the day.I've also been pleased with the fit of the Brainwavz bluetooth headphones.  The headphones come with adjustable silicone tips, in a variety of sizes, thereby ensuring a proper, comfortable fit for all ear sizes (as well as replacements in case you lose one–I’ve had earphones that constantly lose the tips–after over a week of use these, the tips are still hanging on tight!).I also love the convenient red carrying case they come with.  I take this case with me when I take the headphones to the gym and it also conveniently stores all of the silicone tips and the charging cord, so that nothing gets lost.All in all, the Brainwavz BLU-100 Sport Bluetooth 4.0 APTX Headphones have been a big improvement in my audiobook experience!  I can't recommend them highly enough!Source:  Product provided by the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PII2LW9LD80J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDVY34Q#wasThisHelpful","R3PII2LW9LD80J","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a lover of motorcycle club romance books (MC Romance), I took note of the buzz when Nowhere but Here was first released in e-book format earlier this year. Fortunately, for us audiobook lovers, Blackstone has now released the audio version too! What makes Nowhere but Here a little different from the more traditional MC Romances is that it is also geared towards the young adult/teenage (YA) audience. Now, I’m sure you’re saying, why would an adult want to read a YA book? Well, as it turns out, just because the story involves teenagers, and is written in a way to attract teenage readers/listeners, does not necessarily mean it would not also appeal to adults. In fact, some of the most popular and best known paranormal and dystopian romances of our time, including some of my personal favorites, are actually classified as YA. That list includes: Twilight, The Hunger Games and the Divergent series. But an MC Romance – which is typically characterized by dark romance themes – that is geared towards teenagers, now that I had to experience for myself to see if it could actually work.Well, I’m glad I did listen to Nowhere but Here, as it presents an interesting, generally lighter, in terms of erotic and violent content, but nonetheless enjoyable spin to the typical MC Romance. Additionally, Ms. McGarry keeps the listener engaged with the complex, character development and self-identity defining YA appropriate spin to her MC Romance. Add in a good amount of suspense, concerning a tragic, family secret, plus a good narration by the Marguerite Gavin and Sean Pratt narrator team, and you have the recipe for a generally fulfilling, entertaining and romantic listen. The one area, where I will note that I had hoped for a little more is in the resolution of the conflict. It seemed like at the end, everything was resolved just a little too neatly and perfectly for a convincing result. Nonetheless, the journey to that result is worth a listen.For the full review, please see AudioGals (less)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LS6OB8W0VLUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVFMI6I#wasThisHelpful","R1LS6OB8W0VLUU","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love your romantic suspense titles with a little bit of an edgier, alpha dom flavor, then, the Stark International spin-off series from the Stark Series by J. Kenner, might just be right up your alley.  On My Knees is the second book in this sequential/chronological series that requires that you read or listen to Say My Name first to completely understand the suspense-filled background, as well as, the love story of Jackson Steele and Sylvia Brooks.  Moreover, On My Knees ends in a big cliffhanger, so to hear the whole story you will need to commit to listening to Under My Skin (the third and final book in the series).  Fortunately, however, Under My Skin released earlier this week, so the whole trilogy is now available.On My Knees picks up where Say My Name ends.  Both Jackson and Sylvia have deep dark secrets.  The revelation and residual effects of those secrets will collide and bring forth one heart wrenching quandary in On My Knees.  It will be impossible for both Jackson and Sylvia to be able to keep their secrets hidden from others, and they will be forced to pick the public revelation of one person's past over the other.  Can Jackson and Sylvia possibly weather this storm that has them directly pinned against one another?  Moreover will they both be able to cope with the loss of control that such a dark situation will undoubtedly unleash?  Previously having learned to cope with their control issues by reveling in each other's dominance and submission, will they be able to continue that trust dependent relationship under their new reality?Abby Craden returns as the narrator to render another above average performance in On My Knees. What I love the most about Abby Craden as a narrator is her undeniably sexy voice.  Her portrayals add an extra sense of heat which is particularly fitting in an erotically charged series, like the Stark International Series.Moreover, the continuity of keeping Ms. Craden as the narrator of this series, lends a sense of familiarity as she continues the prior voices that I have already associated with this cast.  Varying her pitch for Sylvia's dialogue to a slightly higher pitch, so that she is easily distinguishable from Jackson, Ms. Craden also delivers satisfyingly distinguishable dialogues, so that it is easy to know who is talking without having to relay on dialogue tags.I also enjoyed the breathless quality that Ms. Craden lends Sylvia in the numerous bedroom scenes. Perhaps my only observation (which is the same observation I had in Say My Name), is that as part of this effect, at times, the dialogue was delivered in a somewhat slow fashion. While this had the desired effect of heightening the feel of the erotic scenes, it also prolonged the listen somewhat.All in all, I enjoyed On My Knees. Both the writing and the narration kept me engaged and wanting more. The one thing I will say is that this book has some scorching hot scenes, so you will want to listen to this one in private!  Now I can't wait to see how the cliffhanger is resolved in Under My Skin!Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13P5LLU1NG0WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDNHFYS#wasThisHelpful","R13P5LLU1NG0WM","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Reminding me of a cross between the hit television series Alias from the 2000s and Moonlighting from the 1980s, Consumed by Fire managed to hit a perfect bulls-eye for me. From the secretive covert agency dynamics, to the incredibly hot, witty and downright hilarious at times repartee between the hero and the heroine, this is one book that is chock full of rich, enjoyable material.

"Episode 5, the last of the 5-part Timber Towers Series, was a fitting conclusion to this erotically charged, real estate based, romantic suspense series.  We finally get past events totally revealed and obtain answers to all our questions. Please note though that this series must be read in chronological order, so if you have not yet read Episodes 1-4, then you will not want to read the rest of my review below, until you have done so.  The good news is that all the Episodes have now been published, so if you haven't yet started this serial, you can start it now and will not have to wait to get the whole story!Episode 5 continues where Episode 4 leaves off. Frankie is in danger as Derek and, his sister, Hayden get closer to finally doling out justice.  Moreover, Frankie's ex has yet to completely be convinced that Frankie has moved on.  Derek, being the dominant man he is, needs to reconcile his need to control with Frankie's desires.  Moreover, Frankie has an unrelated, tragic event that tests her her ability to cope.  Will Frankie be able to trust Derek to give her what she needs at a time when she needs him the most?  And will Frankie be safe in the end to enjoy a HEA with Derek?The heat level definitely ratcheted up in this last installment!  I love Derek's alpha moments!  Moreover, it was nice to see how it all came together in the end.  This was my first read by Marni Mann, but I will definitely be looking to read more of her works in the future.Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367VJMA64P2J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147OSS58#wasThisHelpful","R367VJMA64P2J0","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a heart-wrenching story! Bright Side is one of those gems that everyone should listen to help them appreciate what’s truly important in life. It’s so easy to get caught up in everything else and lose perspective. But sometimes, if you’re really lucky, you will come across that once-in-a-lifetime person, your “bright side” who, notwithstanding their own unfathomable plot in life, manages to balance a sense of epic selflessness and optimism that is inspiring and brings out the best in others.

"I have always been a fan of Ms. Chase's work (who isn't a Drew Evans fan?), but I have to say, I fell in love all over again with Ms. Chase's writing in Sustained! As a mother of three, and a lawyer to boot, I can totally relate to the wild escapades that Jake and Chelsea had to navigate on their journey to love. It's like starting with the mini-van and white picket fence before the first date, but totally hilarious and and yet strangely familiar and endearing all the same.Jake Becker is on his way to criminal defense lawyer super stardom. Soon he will make the holy grail of every big law associate's dreams: partner. The fact, that he has no ball and chain or kids to distract him, makes it all the more easier . . . a set of circumstances he plans to continue for the rest of his life while enjoying everything that a lucrative career can offer.When he meets a boy who tries to pick his pocket, however, he can't help but see himself in his eyes. He too was once a lost youth, and had it not been for his mentor, a judge, he would likely not be where he is today. So he takes pity on the youth and does the right thing by returning him to his home, rather than turning him in to the authorities. To his vast surprise, however, the boy is only one of six orphaned kids living in a large brood, now being taken care of by a very young and attractive aunt named Chelsea McQuaid.A few unfortunate events later for the McQuaid clan, and Jake is firmly entrenched in the front lines of this family's matters. While he is enjoying helping out, he and Chelsea can't help but feel the undeniable attraction. But can Jake afford to take his usual fast and loose approach with Chelsea, when there is so much more riding on the line? Notwithstanding what he feels, could his bottom line focused career approach ever be flexible enough to accommodate more?What a fantastic story! From the main characters to the children who play such a central role in bringing the hero and heroine together, you won't be able to help but root for them all to find their HEA!Ms. Chase's writing just keeps getting better and better.

"Having been a lover of the Artists Trilogy by Karina Halle, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to read the continuation of Javier's story, in this spin-off series, particularly given that this story is presently free on Amazon! Ms. Halle's ability to test the moral compass within the dark romance genre is unparalleled and her skill is definitely put to the test in Dirty Angels. Please note that this is a very dark read, and includes subjects such as rape, graphic torture, murder and therefore may not be suitable for all romance readers.Following his disappointing unhappily ever after with Ellie, Javier is even more jaded than ever. He no longer has any desire to shroud himself in the healing powers of a good woman, instead he is more convinced than ever before that he has no soul and is perpetually incapable of love. His career choice, as the head of a Mexican cartel, and the necessarily inhuman actions he must condone and sanction to retain his coveted leadership position, no doubt lead him further and further down the rabbit hole of ruin.His latest act of cruelty in the game of power, leaves a beauty queen, and the reluctant young bride of a rival drug lord, in the chess game of cartel power. All Luisa Chavez has ever cared about, even above her own health and well being, is her parents. The fact that her father suffers from Alzhiemer's disease and her mother is blind, means that their livelihood rests on her shoulders. That's why even knowing it was tantamount to signing her own death sentence, she agreed to marry Salvador Reyes, the infamous and sadistic leader of Mexico's highest ranking cartel, in return for his promise to financially provide for her destitute parents.Being with a husband who routinely beat and raped her was bad enough, but then she awakens to find herself at the hands of his brutal enemy, and aspiring competitor, Javier Bernal. A man who plans to use her as a bargaining chip to expand his empire and teach her husband a lesson by branding her with his own wicked sense of torture.But Luisa's goodness begins to shine through even as she accepts her fate that she will likely die at Javier's hands. Moreover, her purity is equally becoming tinged with her own hunger for violence and the dirtying of her soul. And her bravery and spirit awakens something in Javier that he long thought dead. Perhaps he may find a queen who is willing to be as sullied as he after all. Nonetheless, a man in his position can never show weakness and caving into his desires might just cause him to lose everything he has fought so hard for. Can there possibly be any sort of a HEA for Luisa when she is just a pawn between two kings?I have to say some of the parts of this book were definitely difficult to read. Nonetheless the story, as is usual with Ms. Halle's romantic suspense titles, had me enthralled. In fact, I'd have to say this was a 5 star read for nearly the entire book. However, there was one plot twist that tested my bounds of what I could imagine happening in reality, and therefore I felt compelled to deduct half a point. Nonetheless, that one twist aside this was an amazing story, and it's just the beginning as Javier's and Louisa's will continue in book 3, due to come out in September. It is also advisable, though not absolutely necessary to read book 2 (Dirty Deeds), which primarily accounts Javier's sister's (Alana's) story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D56YWIXE4PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7MB38E#wasThisHelpful","R2D56YWIXE4PY","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a huge fan of Karen Marie Moning’s Fever series, I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to review King’s by Mimi Pamfiloff, which many have hailed as being on the same level with KMM’s unique, paranormal/urban fantasy romance series. Of course there is a whole other camp of reviewers who have complained that this book, and in fact the entire King’s series, too closely resembles the Fever series to be considered an original work. Interestingly, while I can definitely see some parallels and similarities, King’s originality didn’t present as large of an issue for me as the fact that I just plain failed to feel much of a connection to either the story line or the heroine. Instead, I was left with a feeling that most of the book was dedicated to the building of a whole lot of drama, focused on the heroine’s near paralyzing fear of the hero who she, no surprise, repetitively compares to the devil, without much provocation or other justification. The fact that I also had a few issues with the narration perhaps also negatively influenced my perspective. Nonetheless, giving this series the benefit of the doubt, and the fact that the premise certainly has potential, it may just be that to get the full effect of Ms. Pamfiloff’s story, and character development, you must experience the entire trilogy.You can see the full review at AudioGals.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BO82E62KQCE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K59QO74#wasThisHelpful","R2BO82E62KQCE1","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 ""Missed Connections"" Stars!Lovers of first love and ""the one that almost got away"" themed romances will not want to miss Before We Were Strangers! This book blew me away, and transported me back to long ago college days and impossible choices between true love and career goals. I was so enthralled in this touching heart wrenching story, and the incredibly well developed characters, that I even found the time to binge read this page turner during a very busy vacation.Grace was a struggling music student at NYU when she met her next door dorm mate, Matt, a photography transfer student from USC. Although Matt came from a rich family (well at least his father's side, who also were generally disappointed he hadn't followed in the lucrative footsteps of his lawyer father), Grace and Matt bonded over unconventional ways to scrimp and save to make a few bucks while earning their degrees--among other unique friendship overtures. They spent many days with Matt taking pictures of Grace, his first muse, and Grace serenading Matt while she practiced her cello.Theirs was necessarily a relationship that emerged out of friendship, even as they each wanted more. But what could their future hold following graduation as they pursued their dreams? Perhaps it's just a case of meeting the right person at the wrong time?Nonetheless their separation was unexpected and as life continued around them a frequent unsettling question presented itself from time to time: what if? A chance encounter 15 years later may allow them to explore that question. But can you ever go back to that incredible feeling of experiencing love for the first time or are you just doomed to continue failing to recreate that exceptional feeling?This was my first read by Renee Carlino.

"Flight, the first book in the Crescent Chronicles, is a Young Adult paranormal romance. As is typical of Young Adult romances, the intimate scenes are very tame and could easily be appropriate for listeners of junior high age on up. Additionally, the plot is mostly focused on the paranormal world and coming of age of issues, once again making this title suitable for almost all ages of romance readers.One area that I found lacking, however, was the romance. While I’m used to the passionate descriptions in this sub-genre being generally glossed over (or avoided altogether) the romance is usually epic. In that regard, images of Bella and Edward from Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight or Katniss and Peeta from Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games comes instantly to mind. In Flight, however, I felt the romance was superficial and rushed, thereby leading to my dissatisfaction with the one element of YA romance that I have come to count on and highly enjoy. The paranormal world building was also brief in nature, perhaps due to the short-length (only about 5 and a half hours) or to the fact that this is just the first in a series of five books and novellas. Fortunately Amy Rubinate does render her typical talented performance, thereby at least ensuring the narration is a plus for this title.See the full review at AudioGals.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8IWIKNIBRECM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XL12IW#wasThisHelpful","R8IWIKNIBRECM","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a story that combines a number of my favorite romance sub-genres, Penny Reid manages to bring to life another touching romance.  With a touch of MC romance flavor added to a splash of suspense and packaged altogether with a big dose of new adult, identity searching angst, Truth or Beard is a great romance and debut novel to the Winston Brother series.The Winston Brother series will be centered around the love lives of six bearded brothers from the mountains of Green Valley, Tennessee.  As you can already tell from this first book in the series, each brother has his own unique attributes and challenges which will no doubt present plenty of material for entertaining exploits to come.  Additionally, the lives of the Winston family is equally impacted by some of the social dynamics that affects this small town, including a local MC of the illegal variety to which their father (who has been anything but a father) belongs to.Truth or Beard specifically tells the romantic tale of Duane Winston, one of the red-headed Winston twins.  Duane and Beau are exact opposites, and therefore it is no surprise that the hometown girl that Duane fell in love with as a boy, Jessica James, has always seemed to have a crush on Beau.  Perhaps the fact that Duane's feelings seemed to be unrequited should also not be too surprising given that Duane and Jessica spent their childhood years fighting like cats and dogs and taunting each other with practical jokes, whereas Beau and Jessica always seemed to get along.So when a case of mistaken identity leads Jessica to question just what she feels for each brother, Duane sees his opportunity to properly woo and court Jessica, since he's decided she's his forever.  Jessica, however, irrespective of the chemistry, has always had wanderlust dreams of discovering the world.  Therefore any courting by either brother will necessarily have to be of the temporary variety since she plans on leaving Green Valley to explore the world just as soon as she can raise enough money.With these diametrically opposed end goals, can Duane and Jessica possibly find a way to combine their dreams to accomplish a HEA?  Moreover, as the local MC chapter sets its sites on recruiting the Winston twins, a fate which they have been fighting for a long time, the danger escalates calling into question whether a man like Duane even deserves someone as good as Jessica James, the daughter of the local sheriff and sister to one of its deputies.What a fantastic read!  I particularly enjoyed Duane's old-fashioned sense of romance.  That's such an unusual perspective in today's romance novels, particularly as it pertains to the hero, that it was a delightful change of tone.What a great start to the Winston Series.  Next up is Jethro's story scheduled for release in 2016.  I can't wait!Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPGP9S3MZKVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIHMD2K#wasThisHelpful","R3GPGP9S3MZKVN","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Scandals, games, and adventure abound in Scandal and the Duchess. I will say that, strangely for a book of its length, the underlying plot of this title started a bit slow. I did eventually warm up to it, especially towards the end, where some unexpected and intriguing suspense kicked in.As tends to be the case in most novella length books (this one is only 4 hours and 40 minutes), the romance had a bit of an instalove feel to it. Still, I enjoyed the characters. Steven in particular is an admirable, strong alpha natured hero, who is always looking to protect a damsel in distress, and the heroine is also equally compelling with her independent spirit and courage to face the mounting negative public opinion against her and continue to march strong irrespective of it.See the full review at AudioGals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34IOMXUWAOGEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLNST92#wasThisHelpful","R34IOMXUWAOGEI","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovers of rockstar and love triangle romances will not want to miss Beat! Sporting a choice between her teenage fantasy rock n roll idol and the new kid on the block opening act rocker, Beat's heroine Lucky (which she sure is!) has one whopper of a decision to make.Luciana ""Lucky"" Alessandra Valentine fell in love with Dylan Ryder as a young teen. A fantasy which she began each night as she would fall asleep to visions of all his rocker hotness on the posters on her bedroom walls. Therefore now in her twenties, the fact that she has achieved making her dreams a reality, and has now been dating Dylan for the past year seems like she has achieved the impossible. She should be the happiest girl in the world, but instead she finds herself wondering what's next, particularly given that Dylan, now a 35 year old singer feeling his age, seems determined to take their relationship to the next level.Oddly enough, Lucky first meets Flynn Beckham at the bar that she co-owns called Lucky's on her last night officially tending bar. He instantly catches her attention but Lucky knows Dylan is waiting for her to join him on tour, and ignores their mutual attraction. So imagine Lucky's surprise when she finds out that Flynn is none other than Dylan's band's soon to start opening act.As Lucky is also a voice coach, and Flynn is recovering from a vocal nodule, they get to work intensely together while on tour. Their time together only serves to remind them of how perfect they could be together. But even if Lucky were inclined to forego her teenage dreams to pursue the man who makes her feel adult happiness like no other, could there possible be any future in store for her and Flynn once Dylan finds out (especially given that Dylan finding out is likely to end Flynn's career)? Alternatively, could Lucky ever be fully happy with Dylan now that she knows what a true special connection feels like?I have now read a number of Vi Keeland's books and she never disappoints. Beat is no exception. Although I will caution you that this story contains a trigger issue for some (cheating), I nonetheless truly felt the characters' conundrum and emotional angst. I also appreciated the development and maturation process that the heroine demonstrates over the course of the story. Just like our priorities change over time, so can the perfect man of one's dreams; and Beat is the perfect illustration of the difficult choices that we must sometimes make to achieve true happiness.Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMHFNT38OHK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOMUV12#wasThisHelpful","R1BMHFNT38OHK2","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 “The Missing Link” Stars! Lovers of inspirational romances will be thrilled to discover Zack by Sawyer Bennett. With an average rating of 4.12 and over 82,ooo+ ratings on Goodreads, its safe to say that Sawyer Bennett is one of the more popular romance writers of today. Somehow, I hadn’t yet had the good fortune of experiencing Ms. Bennett’s writing. Being a lover of sports romances, however, I knew my time had come when I read the blurb for Zack. Well, Zack was everything I thought it would be plus more! I simply could not put this story down. From the quirky, “nerdy” heroine, who is working hard to finish her studies to overcome her extreme poverty, to the devasted hero, who had to learn how to live again, following the accidental death of the mother of his child, this book tackles some difficult subjects all the while delivering in the hot, steam-filled passion department.Zack Grantham is learning how to be a single dad, even as he is trying to cope with immeasurable guilt over the loss of his former girlfriend, and the mother of his son, who died in a car accident when he was at the wheel. Being there for his son, is about the only thing he has been able to accomplish in the months since the accident. Other than that, he feels empty and incapable of feeling no matter what extremes he goes to to try to elicit a response. Now nearly fully healed from a wrist injury that has kept him off the ice, he is ready to return to his position on the Carolina Cold Fury hockey team, but first he must find a nanny for his son. Of course no one could possibly ever fill his son’s mom’s big shoes, calling for even more grief on his part.Kate Francis learned early to hide her body and looks from the unwelcome advances of men. Hidden beneath the glasses and second hand frumpy, oversized clothes is a beautiful woman who has yet to explore her sexuality. Kate knows accepting a position with the extremely handsome, but clearly still grieving Zack, will be difficult at best, but Kate instantly connects with his son and is determined to find a way to make it all work. If that means she can also manage to make Zack smile, from time to time, with her quirky sense of humor–a talent she has perfected over the years–then all the better, as poor Zack could certainly use some sunshine in his life.When their easy going connection opens the way to physical attraction, Zack and Kate must ponder whether potentially destroying a good working relationship is worth the risk, especially given that Zack makes it clear from the get-go that following his loss, he will never be able to give anything more than just his body. Can Kate show Zack the way to emotional healing before there intimacy, without a heart connection, takes too much of a toll on her resolve?What an amazing story. I loved watching both Zack and Kate mature and evolve in their own ways. Moreover, their interactions with Zack’s young son were heartwarming, and the interplay of the other Cold Fury characters was equally inspirational. In particular, I really loved Sutton (the heroine from Alex). Sutton’s ability to see through outwardly appearance to what truly lies underneath, and lack of concern with social appearances, never mind her commitment to helping her friends find true happiness, really touched me. Now I know that I must go back and read Alex asap! Fortunately, Amazon presently has it on sale for just $0.99, so I for one know I will be enjoying this story soon! Additionally, I’m looking forward to Ryker’s story, another enigmatic secondary character from Zack, due to be released in September of this year (2015).Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZXDQGKZLFNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OX5C#wasThisHelpful","R1RZXDQGKZLFNU","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another fantastic MC Romance by Kristen Ashley! I love how Ms. Ashley finds a way to incorporate characters from both the Dream Man and The Rock Chick Series into this story. If you love your MC Romances on the lighter side of the violence scale and with less vivid detail of the seedier, darker side of the MC world, then I highly recommend Motorcycle Man (the fourth book in the Dream Man Series) and The Chaos Series spin-off. Moreover who can resist Ms. Ashley's unique brand of alpha hot heroes, particularly when paired with a strong, intelligent heroine who knows just how to dish it out, while at the same time being respectful of the unique biker brother code. It's a fine balance but no one tows the line better than KA!The narration was also relatively good--4.5 Stars overall. One small rant is that different narrators are used for each of KA's series, which can leave you with a loss of continuity. While this may work better for some characters (for example, I enjoyed Angela Starling's portrayal of Tack's deep and gravely voice better than the original voice used by Kate Russell in the Dream Man Series which is where his character first appears), there were also some characters that didn't live up to the original. For example, I have come to know and love Kate Russell's portrayal of the sassy, unique Elvira who works with Hawk Delgado and Angela's Starling's portrayal just sounded too flat for this dynamic character. She almost felt like an imposter (think of a character who is replaced by a different actress after a few successful seasons--it just doesn't feel right). Oh well, maybe one day they will rerelease all of KA's interconnected series narrated by one narrator!Minor narration issues aside, I can't wait to move on to listen to Laney's and Hop's story next!Source: Personally purchased copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q548X6FN4L1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMIL9C8#wasThisHelpful","R1Q548X6FN4L1Q","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovers of smart, witty, self-independent heroines will not want to miss Suddenly One Summer. I loved the tension between this duo and the way that their strengths and weaknesses complemented one another. Being a lawyer myself, I could totally get how a legal professional--especially a divorce lawyer--could develop a jaded perspective towards HEAs. The inspiring message that even the most jaded of the jaded individuals are capable of falling into their own perfect match--even when they are wholeheartedly determined to run in the other direction--is a message that a romantic like me, just can't help but to fall in love with.When you combine the philandering ways of her father, and her never ending divorce caseload, Victoria Slade has seen enough marriages fall apart to know that she should avoid falling into that trap like the plague. As a woman does have needs, however, Victoria is perfectly willing to satisfy those urges with casual no strings attached relationships. Frankly, with her demanding career, she is also convinced that's all she has time for anyway.When she first meets investigative journalist Ford Dixon during a night of drinks at a bar, she assumes Ford may just be the right guy to scratch that itch for at least one night. But when she later finds out he is her new next door neighbor, a man who seems to have an endless ""cavalcade"" of willing females to entertain him, Victoria's initial interest turns sour, leading to some rather feisty, spite filled interchanges.When it turns out that one of the women in Ford's ""calvacade"" is actually his sister, who got knocked up during a one night stand, and now can barely support herself much less the child, Victoria's altruistic side can not resist taking on her case pro bono. However, that means teaming up with none other than her hot, cocky, annoying neighbor, who will perform the services to track down the MIA baby daddy.Soon they are experiencing success both in their joint venture and their personal interactions-- a fact which only reconfirms their initial attraction. However, getting physically involved can only complicate their working relationship and could never lead to anything anyways given their mutual desires to stay away from any form of a long term relationship. When they each begin to realize that the other may very well be the sole exception to their rule against a HEA, will they be brave enough to explore what they always strived to avoid?Wow, what a story. I loved Ms. James' attention to the development of each character's background and intense psychological and past history barriers towards commitment. The joint tackling of Ford's sister's case also provided an interesting side story to add to the suspense and complexity of the central romance. The combination of both these story lines converges to form a satisfying romance with depth.This was my first experience with Julie James. I kept hearing such great things about her writing, that when I got an opportunity to review Suddenly One Summer, I jumped at the chance. I am so glad I did! I now know that there is a vast backlist, including Ms. James' highly rated FBI/US Attorney Series, that I can't wait to sit down and explore!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIXSNESBMCC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425273768#wasThisHelpful","R1XIXSNESBMCC8","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love your romances short, cute, sweet, and full of laughs, then The Bet may be a good bet for your next listen. Having previously listened to several books in Ms. Van Dyken’s Eagle Elite series (mafia New Adult), I have to admit that I was expecting something a little different (deeper and more emotionally angst ridden). Nonetheless, in the right frame of mind, The Bet comes off as the classic tale of what happens when two brothers fall in love with the girl next door, except here, it’s riddled with tons of jokes, puns, and crazy laugh-out-loud, off the wall scenarios. As for the narration, with the caveat that it was somewhat difficult to distinguish the two brothers who are the main characters in this story, Tanya Eby otherwise delivers a decent performance.For the full review see AudioGals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KU4MURKDK4DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554146#wasThisHelpful","R2KU4MURKDK4DP","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fifth book in the Seven series once again proves that you can always count on the fab writer/narrator duo of Dannika Dark and Nicole Poole to deliver a solid paranormal romance. While I have to admit that Wheeler, with his dark, brooding personality is not my favorite Weston brother, Three Hours nonetheless delivers a believable, heart warming romance with a good dose of suspense and action, which are the classic hallmarks of the Seven Series. Additionally, like each of the four books that came before this one, Three Hours also contains threads of originality that render the romance fresh and is sure to keep listeners on their toes. In this case, be prepared for a hero who enjoys a little bit of submission and an elegant heroine whose animal wields an inordinate amount of power that is both feared and desperately sought to be enslaved by many familiar with her breed.Please note that this series must be read in order for maximum enjoyment as there is a larger story arc concerning the shifter world that evolves successively over each book. Additionally, although each book features one primary couple, and the unfolding of their love story, the prior couples continue to evolve and play influential roles in the later books. Both the hero and the heroine have been previously introduced in prior books--Wheeler being one of the Weston brothers and Naya being the exotic dancer, best friend of Lexi (the heroine from Seven Years).Notwithstanding that both Wheeler and Naya share the common trait of being self-reliant and extremely independent--a trait no doubt derived from their mutual attempts to keep their own dangerous secrets hidden--they still nonetheless always seem to fight like ""cats and dogs"" whenever they have had the misfortune of crossing paths in the past.But everything changes when Naya comes to Austin, the Weston Pack's leader and Wheeler's brother, for protection and help to find a missing exotic dancer from the club she works at and Austin assigns Wheeler the role of acting as Naya's bodyguard. Forced to spend time together they soon acquire a deep respect for one another and eventually become unable to mask their mutual attraction. It isn't long before they are divulging to each other secrets that they have not shared with any one else, and are longing to bring their physical chemistry to its natural fruition. However, when Naya's secrets and Wheeler's secrets converge, they soon will find each other in the cross hairs of an extremely dangerous plot; and they will be forced to decide between their love for one another and their own lives.Nicole Poole as always delivers a great performance in Three Hours. I find it remarkable that with so many different characters involved in the Seven Series, she is nonetheless able to impart each one with his or her own unique sound. Additionally, Ms. Poole's characterizations have remained remarkably consistent across the five books in the series thus far, causing you to feel like you are settling into a new story with old familiar characters that you have come to know and love in the prior Seven Series books.From the Indian to the Spanish accents, and the old to the young, Ms. Dark does a fantastic job of conveying each character's unique traits via her delivery of their dialogue. Naya, for example, sounds just like the exotic dancer, diva you would expect her to be, but nonetheless very powerful all in the same. Whereas, Wheeler sounds like the glum, social outcast he has portrayed himself to be in the prior books. I love that in Three Hours we finally come to know what deep dark secrets Wheeler has been hiding--and which when you learn them--ultimately redeem him as an honorable, loyal man. Interestingly, Ms. Poole's performance is so magical that you almost feel like you can hear the difference in his dialogue from the beginning as compared to the end when he generally becomes a more likable hero.All in all, I greatly enjoyed Three Hours. The Seven Series has come to be one of my favorite paranormal romance series of all time, and I can't wait to continue the adventure with what promises to be one of the most epic love stories of all: Denver and Maizy's story! Stay tuned for this next installment in the Seven Series, titled Two Minutes and which is scheduled to be released later this year (August 2015).Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNWN04OIU1POS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150549088X#wasThisHelpful","RNWN04OIU1POS","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't stop reading this captivating best friends turned lovers romance. Fans of love stories that involve emotional healing--in this case on both the hero's and heroine's part--will not want to miss Searching For Beautiful. This story tore me apart and gave me courage to renew my hope in love all at different points. The thought that people with past demons would settle for something less than true happiness, due to their own insecurities and past misfortunes, and that others would prey on such weaknesses, is heart wrenching. Gen's and Wolfe's story will make you angry and want to fight for these poor souls, all the while giving you faith that every person, no matter how damaged, has their own unique soulmate who can heal and provide them with true happiness. If you are ""searching for"" a ""beautiful"" love story, then look no further!As this is the third book in the Searching For Series, I feel that it is important to note that this story can nonetheless be read as a standalone. In that regard, I will point out that while there is definitely some overlap of the secondary characters who were involved in the prior books, the love story between the primary couple in Searching for Beautiful is fully contained in this book.Genevieve MacKenzie, a medical resident, is about to experience what's supposed to be one of the happiest days of her life--her wedding day--and yet all she feels is great anxiety. Her fiance, who is also the Chief Surgeon at her hospital, and thereby also her boss, should be the perfect man for her HEA. Somehow, however, what used to be a dream come true has become quite the nightmare the closer they get to their big day. Manipulative and controlling, Dr. David Riscetti seems more concerned about turning her into his trophy wife than in truly making her happy.Gen seizes the opportunity and chooses to go with her gut when she attempts to flee the inevitable disaster by climbing out the church window rather than walking down the aisle. Little could she have expected that the one man who would catch her fall would be none other than her one-time former best friend, Wolfe. Having become somewhat alienated from Wolfe since her engagement to David, Gen is surprised to find just how at ease she quickly becomes when Wolfe enables her escape and actually takes it upon himself to bring some joy back into Gen's life in this time of need. Imagine their surprise when after a short respite together they both realize that their feelings for one another have evolved making their once strictly platonic relationship a near certain impossibility. But, could they ever risk losing their most important relationship, their unique friendship, just to indulge their more base needs? Moreover, Gen is not the only one with past tragedies. Given their mutually damaged pasts--and failure to provide full disclosure--could they ever hope to find a HEA when all their secrets are out in the open?What an intriguing story. Although of late I have read a lot of best friends to lovers stories, I was pleased to find that the art of this beautiful romance lies in the poignant way that Jennifer Probst tells this story. Ms. Probst draws you in and maintains your attention to the very end. Now I can't wait for the release of the next volume in the Searching For Series, Waiting for Always, which is scheduled to be release at the end of this month (June 2015).Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHE4QIGKHCVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OLTG#wasThisHelpful","R1VHE4QIGKHCVO","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, Glimmer is a scorcher in the heat department, which I was expecting based on the blurb, but what totally caught me off guard, and perhaps I loved the most, was the unexpected intensity of the suspense of this well developed read. Reminding me of a cross between E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey and Karen Robards' Dr. Charlotte Stone Series, Glimmer has a little bit of something for nearly every type of romance reader. Glimmer, however, does end in a cliffhanger, so if you want to know the full story, you will need to commit to reading Glow, book 2 in the Glimmer and Glow Series, which is scheduled to be released in December of 2015.Alice Reed never dreamed that she, a student at a run of the mill business school, would be recruited to participate in the world renowned, summer program at Camp Durand.  Given that an internship at Camp Durand could lead to an executive position at Durand, Inc., one of the US's top fortune 200 companies, the nation's top elite MBA students typically fight it out to fill the precious few spots.As soon as Alice arrives, she realizes just how different she is from the typical candidate, which only causes her to further wonder why Dylan Fall, Durand's CEO, would have taken a chance on her.  It doesn't take long, however, for Alice to feel the passionate chemistry that unites them, confirming her unique assets.  Rather than fight it, Alice dives head first into the intense and erotic world that Dylan insists on introducing Alice to.However, after a short while, it becomes clear that Dylan has been less than truthful with her, leaving her to question just what deep dark secrets Dylan is hiding and just what demons from the past Alice may need to battle if she is truly determined to try and seek a rightful place in Dylan's future.However, just when you think you have the plot figured out, think again, because there is much more depth to this story than just your typical erotic, controlling billionaire with past issues.  I loved the intensity of the interactions between Dylan and Alice, but also enjoyed sleuthing the clues that Beth Kery sprinkled throughout the story.  Pay close attention because these little nuggets ultimately lead up to the reveal of one wallop of a secret which will completely change the playing field.I, for one, can't wait to continue Dylan's and Alice's story in Glow!  I'm sure more secrets, and lots of boundary pushing erotic episodes, await!Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13RL3HHBPI8DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2BKJFO#wasThisHelpful","R13RL3HHBPI8DM","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an emotional journey! I started and ended Confess in tears. Without a doubt, this is one of the most creative, thought provoking, romantic listens I have had the good fortune of listening to in a long time. If you are a Colleen Hoover fan, then you are already familiar with her talented writing in the New Adult and Young Adult romance sub-genres. What I find the most fascinating about Ms. Hoover’s stories is that even though they all tend to fall somewhere between those two sub-genres, they still nonetheless all have their own sense of originality. It is this lack of a typical mold that keeps Ms. Hoover’s stories so engrossing and her ability to capture human nature (both the good and the bad) that makes you connect with her characters so profoundly.See the full review at AudioGals.Source: Audiobook borrowed from my local library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQ89LJB5MDVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ1IIP0#wasThisHelpful","R3IQ89LJB5MDVX","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chasing Me is the continuation of James' and Quinn's story from Beyond Me, with some interesting changes. They have moved to Chicago together, and James has now left behind the comforts of his rich lifestyle to pursue his interest in art in an effort to become a man worthy of Quinn's love. Perhaps that is the aspect that I loved the most about this story.

"ShutterGirl is unlike any other movie star romance I've read, proving once again that CD Reiss is a master at writing original, poignant and heart stirring romances. Among the many facets that make this a fantastic read is the successful juxtaposition of two such completely different viewpoints--the A-list movie star and the paparazzi who stalks him--and the fact that Ms. Reiss still manages to find a way for their perspectives to converge and unify in the end.Laine Cartwright thought she had finally moved on and forgot the boy who so captivated her all those many years ago.  A boy, who although he should never have been accessible to a girl like her, a foster kid from the wrong side of the tracks, nonetheless interrupted his routine to let her in his world once.The day he left, she threw herself in a pit of danger, just to feel something real again. Somehow she managed to dig herself out of that hole, and has resurrected herself as her own force within Hollywood circles.  Today, Laine is one of the elite paparazzi, who can always be counted on to click and preserve  America's royalty--movie stars and other A-listers who travel in their circles--for common consumption.Interestingly enough, Michael Greydon has also reinvented himself.  Today, he has followed in his father's footsteps, and is on the sure path to super movie star stardom.  Laine should know, as she has watched him rise through the lens of her camera every step of the way.They have both graced the streets of Hollywood at opposite ends of the spectrum, but never in this showbiz dance, have they directly acknowledged each other in the nearly 10 years since they last walked away from each other.  Then one heated night their worlds collide again reminding them of what they once knew but the reality of their diametrically opposed worlds forced them to walk away from.  Will an even more defined divide--that which separates the movie stars from the paparazzi--be enough to keep them separate this time for good, when the only certainty they have ever experienced is that nothing ever feels as ""real"" as when they are together?What an amazing story!  Both the various interconnected layers and the way Ms. Reiss so artfully puts it all together were fantastic.  So completely different from her prior books, and yet so similarly insightful of human nature and the basic needs that we all share no matter how dissimilar we may appear.I can't wait to read more of Ms. Reiss' unique romances!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP2S3IV82W1AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSYYB8C#wasThisHelpful","RP2S3IV82W1AZ","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having recently fallen in love with another shifter romance series, I took one look at the blurb for Dark Instincts and just knew I had to listen to it. What particularly called my attention was the idea of two dominant shifters–enforcers for different packs–finding their happiness together. Often times, it’s the hero who is the primary or stronger alpha or dom in PNR books, so Dark Instincts was like a breath of fresh air. In addition, I also really enjoyed the suspense, humor and group dynamics between the extended members of the two packs (the Phoenix and Mercury Packs). Further rounding out this fabulous listen was the talented narration by Jill Redfield.As this is the fourth book in the Phoenix Pack Series it is worth noting that this series, like most paranormal romances, is intended to be read in order. In that regard, as this was my first and only listen of this series, it was definitely clear that a number of the characters had been presented in prior books and had continued to evolve over the series. This made listening to the beginning of this story a little difficult to follow, but I was able to eventually catch on. Additionally the immediate conflict, from a suspense perspective, and the primary romance, were fully resolved within Dark Instincts, so this title could still be read or listened to as a standalone.It isn’t easy being a dominant female shifter in the Mercury pack, particularly given that her brother, Nick, is the alpha wolf leader of the pack. Nonetheless Roni Axton will not be deterred in showing her true personality. As the Mercury Pack’s enforcer, moreover, she is able to use her true nature to help her pack.Marcus Fuller, the enforcer of the Phoenix Pack, has a well earned reputation with the ladies. However, the type of females he usually attracts are nothing like Roni. So imagine Roni’s surprise when a mutual enemy brings their packs together and she soon finds that apprehending/seeking revenge on the bad guys is not the only goal Marcus has set his sights on.The stronger Marcus comes on, the more Roni tries to divert his attention. But strangely enough, Roni soon finds that the one place she finds herself wanting to submit is when she is intimately involved with Marcus. As the two navigate the personal, and pack politics, to determine if a HEA could possibly be in their future; the immediate threat–a jackal pack intent on victimizing members of both the Phoenix and Mercury Packs to further their own demented agenda–becomes even more targeted and personal. Soon the fate of their destinies becomes dependent not just on the taming of their own true natures, but also on winning one of the most dangerous games they have ever been engaged in.This was my first experience with Jill Redfield, and I absolutely loved her performance. Excelling in all the key markers I look for in a great narrator, I now know that I have found a new go to narrator. Not only does Ms. Redfield do a good job of producing authentic male and female voices, but she also provides nuanced distinctions, befitting of the particular character’s personality, to distinguish among the characters of the same gender. Ms. Redfield also conveys the particular emotion or mood of the scene by appropriately varying the speed, and/or, tone of her dialogue.Perhaps my favorite part of Ms. Redfield’s performance was her characterization of Roni. I loved how you could glean Roni’s dominant nature from the authoritative intonation of Roni’s voice. Additionally, you could hear Roni’s angst as she pondered whether any sort of a future could possibly be in her future with such a possessive male like Marcus.If you enjoy shifter romances, with equal parts action/suspense and romance/passion, then you definitely will not want to miss The Phoenix Pack series. I, for one, now can’t wait to go back and explore some of the prior titles in this series.Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPSXCML2ZMK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2T20QG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPSXCML2ZMK1","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this series just keeps getting steamier and steamier! I also love how the suspense aspect of this read is really starting to take a crucial role in the unfolding of the story. I can't wait to continue on to part 4 to see how Derek and Frankie navigate the multiple obstacles that seem to continue to get in the way of their undeniable hot chemistry filled bond.Please note that this is part 3 of a 5 part serial that must be read in order. This review may therefore contain spoilers for the prior parts. If you have not yet started this series, see my review of the first part.Part 3 pretty much picks up where part 2 leaves off. Misunderstandings continue to abound and get in the way of what Frankie and Derek both want, irrespective of the fact that both have multiple reasons why a relationship with each other will never work.Further complicating matters are the hidden motivations and agendas of Reed, Frankie's ex-boyfriend, and Hayden, Derek's sister. Derek's competition and plotting against his father is also taking it's toll. Moreover, Frankie receives potentially career altering news, but it may come with a price.Can Derek and Frankie possibly find a way to have each other and everything else they want? I can't wait to read part 4 to continue to uncover the true extent of the hidden agendas and true motivations and to see if Derek and Frankie will get their HEA.Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183SAWMM1IRS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKJBRZU#wasThisHelpful","R183SAWMM1IRS2","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Capture is a fitting, albeit different styled, conclusion to the Elements of Chemistry Series. With a slower overall feel, and definitely a lower heat level in general in the passion department, this story is more focused on character development.  Like in life, however, at different stages in our lives, we are primed for different priorities. Capture does a good job of exploring this evolution.Please note that this series must be read in order. Accordingly, this review contains spoilers for the previous parts. If you have not yet had the pleasure of starting this series, please see my review for Attraction.Capture picks up several months after the cliffhanger break-up in Heat. Both Kaitlyn and Martin have moved on and are now trying to be together again, but in a different way:  as friends; and not just any friends, but friends that share an apartment together.  As you can imagine, when the chemistry is right, sometimes no matter what you label the mixture, it can’t help but show its right composition.  However, miscommunications abound further complicating this potion.  Will Kaitlyn and Martin, eventually figure out that you can’t keep two opposites that attract near one another without leading to the inevitable?  Or will life continue to interfere with what otherwise would be chemistry perfection?All in all, I enjoyed this sweet, funny and somewhat quirky romance.  And now that it is over, I can’t wait to delve into some more of Ms. Penny Reid’s unique breed of romantic comedies!Source:  Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4TFIAWK2QUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQHNRHA#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4TFIAWK2QUR","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a believer that total honesty is always the best policy, I absolutely loved the moral of this story. Moreover, Helena Hunting had me in stitches with the completely unexpected and yet hilarious things that would come out of the heroine's mouth, never mind her thoughts. If you love heroines that are bold and brash and love to say what comes to their mind, hot sexy athlete heroes, who have a reputation for being uncatchable, and lots of hot, unadulterated passion and laughs when they join forces, then you will love Pucked!Violet Hall knows all about playboy hockey players. Not only is her step-brother, Buck, one of the NHL's most well known man sluts, but her step father is also a scout and coach for one of the best minor league teams. Having been burned by a hockey player before, Violet avoids hockey players like a VD plague.Alex Waters, the team captain of Buck's NHL team has one of the worst reputations, when it comes to player status. A reputation that is no doubt well earned by his rock hard body and to die for looks which have won him plenty of endorsements. The fact that one such endorsement is the subject of Violet's fantasies, when she takes care of business, well that is neither here nor there.When Violet gets to know Alex in person, however, she is shocked and rather intrigued to find that Alex is not your stereotypical dumb jock. No, Alex not only knows his literature, but is quite the gentleman and, most unexpectedly of all, is not just satisfied with a one and done intense physical encounter--at least when it comes to Violet.When it becomes clear, that Alex is interested in more than just Violet's body, and that he is not a man to take ""no"" for an answer, Violet is left with one hell of a quandary: Believe the hype or give in to what she is really craving but fears will end in another world of hurt. However, dating a very public figure has its own quirks and soon Alex and Violet find that they are not the only factors in their relationship. Instead the media can be a very meddlesome third wheel. Can a HEA possibly be waiting for them at the end of the game?What a funny, sweet romance with a great lesson to seal the whole package together! Some of the phrases that Violet coins are absolutely hilarious and so creative! In fact, I'm not sure I will ever look at the initials ""MC"" ever the same again! This is one quirky heroine who loves to let it all hang out, and I for one loved every minute of it!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R18XWXWVF2UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLD27N2#wasThisHelpful","R3R18XWXWVF2UQ","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Romantic suspense lovers, who also like a little extra heat in the passion department, will not want to miss Escaping Reality. This steamy little read had me constantly guessing throughout, and the story has just started. While we get a small glimpse at just what danger the heroine may be fleeing from in Escaping from Reality, the huge cliffhanger at the end, makes it clear that we have only scratched the surface, and moreover it is not just the heroine, but also the hero who is hiding secrets. I can't wait to learn more about ""The Secret Life of Amy Bensen"" and Liam Stone in Book 2, Infinite Possibilities!""Amy"" has been running since she was eighteen. Most recently, she got complacent in her hiding while living in New York, and made the mistake of attracting the attention of her past ghosts by getting a publicly prominent job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Fleeing with just the clothes on her back, and the new identity her handler has concocted and communicated to her via the contents of a large yellow envelope, Amy boards a plane to Denver to assume her new life. It is on this flight that she meets Liam Stone.Amy knows better than to let anyone in to her life, for their own safety as well as hers, and yet she can't help but get caught up in the safety net of Liam's dominant aura. Although she knows she should say ""no"", Amy inexplicably finds herself lured into a passionate night which she originally intends to be a one night stand.Liam Stone is a brilliant architect who has made billions pursuing his passion. Notwithstanding his overwhelming success in the business arena, however, socially he is publicly known as a recluse. Amy catches Liam's eye, however, and he immediately notes her overwhelming need to control her fear. Enraptured both by what he sees, and what he perceives Amy is hiding and he is determined to unravel, Liam makes it his mission to conquer Amy. Part of that goal involves allowing her to ""escape her reality"" by submitting to him in intense erotic episodes that allow her to forget, at least momentarily, the dark secrets she is running from; and the other is to peel back the layers until he exposes the ""raw and honest"" truth.I loved both the mystery and mind engaging suspense of Escaping Reality. Frankly I have pondered Amy's potential plight both during the read, and over the couple of days since I finished the book, and I still haven't been able to definitively sleuth out her precise predicament, though I do have a number of theories. Additionally, as a fan of dominant heroes, Liam Stone is exactly the type of protective alpha hero that I love to encounter in my reads, and those reality escaping passionate encounters were definitely off the charts in the heat department! I can't wait to read Infinite Possibilities! My mind is already running through all of the probable circumstances that could possibly explain both that astounding cliffhanger and Amy's past!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XA3DT46FUKXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L01GHBY#wasThisHelpful","R1XA3DT46FUKXI","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an interesting read that brings together a number of my loves and wraps it all up together in a completely unique packaging! Mixing some of my favorite sub-genres, paranormal/UF, contemporary YA/New Adult romance and Mafia like romantic suspense, Cold Burn of Magic is sure to appeal to a wide audience as it has a little something for everyone! What a fantastic beginning to a new series that is sure to be another hit for Jennifer Estep!Lila Merriweather was forced to learn how to survive early in life. Having lost her mother (a former bodyguard) at a young age, she has tried her best with the help of her mother's friend, a pawn shop owner, to avoid foster homes. Earning her way by stealing and completing odd jobs that her mother's friend assigns to her, and living in the basement of a library that she can only visit after it closes at night, has taught her a lot about making ends meet in the magical world she lives in which is ruled by a few powerful Families of varying magical strengths. Above all costs, the one rule that she has learned is essential she follow, is avoid the Families and never let them know her true magical talents, one of which would nearly certainly be stolen from her if she ever let it be discovered.Everything, however, changes when Lila inadvertently gets involved in an assassination/kidnapping attempt against the son of the head of the Sinclair family, the second most powerful Family. With only a split second to determine her fate, and not really recognizing Devon as a member of the Sinclair Family, Lila throws all caution aside and saves Devon exposing her extraordinary fighting skills.As no good deed goes unpunished, it is this act of selflessness, which, for better or for worse, opens up a whole new world to her. While this puts her square in the sites of Devon Sinclair, a young man who is poised to become the head of the Sinclair Family, and who makes her feel things she has never felt before, it also may just mean that her destiny to live and die like her mother, at the hands of a Family feud, may also be sealed.I loved both the suspense/action-packed angle and magic filled nature of this young adult read. As I typically only read romance titles, I feel compelled to mention that although Cold Burn of Magic is not labeled a romance title, it does have a satisfying, rather subdued, element of romance. In particularly, it really felt to me like Ms. Estep was teeing up this romance aspect to play a more prominent role in upcoming books. I can't wait to continue the Black Blade Series with Dark Heart of Magic which is scheduled to be released in October 2015!Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2JR264GODTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617738247#wasThisHelpful","RV2JR264GODTN","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 ""Revolutionary Beginnings"" Stars for the story and 3.5 Stars for the narration!If you love well developed, historical romances with a BDSM element, in this case primarily disciplinary and erotic spankings, and are looking for a sensual, quick listen; then Humbled may just be the right contender for your next listen. The heat factor on this naughty little listen is off the charts, and the cleverly crafted plot, which could easily have truly taken place during this time period, provides for a captivating and entertaining story.Set during the time period of the French Revolution, Humbled gives us a glance at what life may have been like for both the aristocrats and peasants at around that time. Our hero and heroine meet as children when the heroine, Corrine, a young aristocrat, saves the hero, a peasant named Jean-Claude, from the guillotine.Having been sentenced to die for the theft of a pig that he wasn't even fortunate enough to catch, Jean-Claude would nearly certainly have died that day had it not been for the courage of Corrine to stand up and take blame for his offense instead. Many years later, during the midst of the French Revolution, Jean-Claude has still not forgotten that incredible act of kindness on Corrine's behalf, and determines to return the favor by saving her from near certain death at the hands of an angry mob that is intent on storming her mansion.Corrine instantly recognizes Jean-Claude and allows him to lead her to safety. Determined to see her safe for the long haul, Jean-Claude insists that Corrine flee France. Soon they agree that Corrine will board a ship to New Orleans where she can assume a new life. Unwilling to allow possible harm to an unescorted young female, Jean-Claude also comes along.During this long journey, the couple slowly become aware of their mutual attraction, even as they struggle to acclimate to a new world where their class differences no longer matter. In that regard, Jean-Claude begins showing his dominant side, for both pleasure and disciplinary effect. As their passionate feelings become undeniable, the couple is left struggling with the possible threat that they may still be in danger, never mind have no way of supporting themselves in the New World. Will Corrine and Jean-Claude find their HEA in America? Could a HEA ever possibly take place between two individuals of such different classes?Having previously read a couple of Renee Rose's books, I was familiar with her unique brand of spanking romances, so I knew what to expect from an erotic perspective. Well, I'm pleased to report that not only does Ms. Rose deliver on this front, but I also very much enjoyed the French Revolution history, and particular attention to the difficulties of class imbalances at the time, as well as the underlying love story that was built on the backbone of the impressive and selfless protective nature of both the heroine and the alpha hero.Faith Alowyn Alden renders a fantastic performance in Humbled. In fact, I would have easily given Ms. Alden a 5-star rating based on her performance alone. Not only does she have a beautiful, mesmerizing voice, but she produced unique, distinguishable and personality appropriate intonations for each one of the many cast members, making it incredibly easy to know who was talking without needing to rely on dialogue tags. Ms. Alden also does a great job of conveying the particular mood of a scene in her narratives and imbues her voice with just the right amount of emotion to act out the dialogue between the characters.Unfortunately, however, there were some issues with the production and editing of the audiobook that caused me to lower the overall score. Namely, there was a hollow, almost echo like, sound throughout the entire recording. It almost sounded like the book had been produced in a large auditorium or cave. Another effect of the production--that in my experience is atypical--was that I could hear a light amount of static in the background, almost as if it was recorded during a light rain. There were also a few instances of clicks, and the like, that I would have expected to have been filtered out in the editing process. It is worth noting that notwithstanding these technical issues, after a while of listening, I was able to eventually tune them out. Nonetheless I did feel that it was necessary to point out these matters, as they are not something you would normally expect in a commercially produced title.All in all, I thought Ms. Rose imbued Humbled with just the right amount of balance between the development of a satisfying historical plot, an enticing romance and an erotically charged love story. Further enhancing this story was Ms. Alden's talented reading which, subject to the noted caveats, makes this a good choice to pick in audiobook format.Source: Review copy provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11NNYHN9UMGBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUBRD5K#wasThisHelpful","R11NNYHN9UMGBW","A1SOEOZ4954O2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SOEOZ4954O2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an enjoyable witty, romantic comedy that explores the age old conundrum of what to do when you fall in love with your best friend.  I loved both the hero and heroine, and Kristen Callihan had me laughing throughout this charming, engaging romance.  This was my first experience with Ms. Callihan, but it definitely will not be my last.  Now I can't wait to go backwards and read The Hook Up, Book 1 in the Game On Series, to experience Anna's and Drew's story!  And the great news, particularly for those who have already had the pleasure of both books in this series, is that Book 3,  The Game Plan, is planned for release later this year in the Fall!Gray Grayson is a player, both on and off the field.  As the star tight-end for his college, Gray is expected to potentially go number 1 in the NFL draft.  His moves when it comes to women are also well known, as he is famously known for the one and done maneuver.Gray doesn't befriend women, so the last thing he expects is to become ""attached"" to his potential sports agent's daughter--Ivy Mackenzie-- via text, no less.  All because he did the right thing and let his buddy, Drew, who was suffering from a broken leg, borrow his automatic transmission car, leaving him--courtesy of his potential future agent--with Ivy's, very feminine and tiny pink car to ride around in.  As no good deed ever goes unpunished, it doesn't take very long for Ivy to start summoning threats and implementing rules for Gray to follow when using said pinkalicious car.Ivy, in turn, is busy learning her mother's trade, baking, overseas.  Moreover, she is not the type to fall for the players, particularly any such player that may potentially become a client of her father's.  Nonetheless, she surprisingly finds herself craving Gray's texts.Then when Ivy returns to her father's home for a short stint before her planned departure back to London to run one of her mother's bakeries, Gray's and Ivy's carefully crafted plans for their future all become a jumbled quandary as they are left to sort out just what the nature of their ""friendship"" truly is all about.What a fantastic, touching, new adult read that is sure to appeal to anyone who has ever explored the age old question:  can a boy and girl truly have a strictly platonic relationship.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, we received this JTX-1 trailer/stroller combo for review. We don't bike and so we have only used it with our 3yo for some summer/fall jogging. This is written based on our three months of experience from August to  October.The stroller comes well-packed inside and the box was intact when it arrived. This assured us quite a bit more in comparison to a traditional stroller we ordered at the same time. That one just came with dents and punctures in the box due to a lack of internal padding.The assembling is very simple out of the box, but we didn't realize that there is no car seat adapter before we ordered. This is not exactly Allen's problem but we thought we should point this out.The screen cover has the usual nylon smell in the first week, but it goes away quickly. The zipper is smooth, but it seems to have a small clearance to the side and ""catches"" the fabric quite easily.In actual use for jogging, we lock the front wheel straight and rely on tipping the front off the ground for turning. The large rear wheels and the suspension both make the ride more comfortable when going over small bumps. So far, our kid has not complained.We never jog in the dark with our kid, but we appreciate that the rear wheels have reflectors on it.The harness straps are not as padded as we would like. In the summer (we live in the northeast) this is really a problem because putting more clothes on our kid is not a solution. In the fall, we deal with it with a thicker sweater.We are quite happy with the light weight of the stroller. Our kid is slightly over 30 pounds. Our concern is not the pushing, but the stopping due to momentum. This year we feel that we are still in control. Next summer we expect our kid to be 40 pounds and we are not sure if we will still be mentally comfortable with the momentum. We will come back to revise the review if this proves to be a real concern.Overall, as a jogging system we are very happy with this JTX-1. It is now living in our garage and we look forward to this coming Spring to use it again. Cheers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZX6S2LDRT3NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJZDHXA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZX6S2LDRT3NS","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, we have received a Graco Fast Action Fold Duo LX Click Connect stroller for review. At the time of this writing we have a 3 and a 1.5 year old, each with their own stroller. Packing both stroller into minivan is easy, but we need both of us to be present if we want to use both strollers together. We thought if we have this duo stroller then we can do this with just one of us. There are a lot of positive design features like independent recline and canopy, but we are not going to summarize them in this review since you can just read it in the item's description. Instead, let us write about our experience in actual use.The box came a bit damaged (Amazon shipped it bare: there is no protection whatsoever) and that made us a bit worried at first. Fortunately, the stroller itself is fine and most importantly all the parts stayed inside. Assembling takes less than 10 minutes, and we are really to roll. :)The first thing we realized is how wide this really is, or rather, how much we underestimated its width from the pictures, which are all taken at an angle. To be sure, it goes through doors with about an inch of space on each side left, but our side walk have trees and in one case it just oh so barely squeezes through with a rear wheel of the stroller rubbing on the metal fence of our neighbor. We are quite concerned that it will damage the wheel. Be ware if you are buying this. The rear wheels are about 32 inches apart and are single wheels (not doubles).The second problem is the weight distribution. As mentioned our kids are just 1.5 years apart, which realistically is very close to the smallest gap possible. Still, we can feel that there is an uneven weight distribution when turning. Prior to this, we have tried a front-and-back design when visiting our sis-in-law. We thought we didn't like that design since it is very long and makes for an awkward turn and also higher center of gravity (since the rear seat sits up high). Now that we have tried this side-by-side design, we actually start to prefer the front-and-back design...The third problem is quite obvious but also unavoidable. Two kids plus the car seats plus the stroller is a lot of weight. The spec says that this Duo model can hold two kids of 50 pound each, but we are not so sure about such usage. As a comparison, airline checkin luggage max out at 50 pound also. Honestly, we do not look forward to using this when my older gets to 4 next year.The final problem is actually something we did not anticipate. With two (single) strollers, we can stack them when we get into the minivan and leave the other side of the floor for grocery. This is not so feasible with this duo model.Overall, we feel that this is a great duo stroller and Graco did a great job putting in all the right features. If we want a side-by-side duo stroller, this would be our choice and we highly recommend it. This easily earns a 5/5 in our book. (As you would have observed, all the problems we ended up having is precisely because we do not want a side-by-side duo stroller. We feel it would be unfair to take any point off because of our personal preference.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5NDQRVLGWQ3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOJWOLI#wasThisHelpful","R5NDQRVLGWQ3H","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received this 4-piece decorating kit for review. The four pieces include the silicon squeezer and three tips (circle and two star-like patterns). Usage is super easy: you spoon enough frosting into the silicon body, screw on your chosen tip, and squeeze to pipe. True to the OXO reputation, this is a high quality item. The plastic screw top seems durable, and the silicon body has thick walls. I don't expect any problem in the long run. I especially appreciate the flat bottom of the silicon body. This makes it possible to rest the bottle on the table in-between piping.If I have to nit pick, it would be the design of this kit makes it not so suitable to do smaller batches. The body holds 4oz. If you only put in say 1oz of frosting, then you have to squeeze very hardly during piping. I also find the silicon body a little bit harder to clean than my silicon piping bag, which is perfect in every department (perhaps except a higher price).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L299EVRW1C8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X2OYM#wasThisHelpful","R1L299EVRW1C8G","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously had a similar tension rod of another brand over the shower for hanging hand-washed laundry items, all of which are pretty light. The rubber on the old one finally lost its holding power this fall and I replaced it with this Maytex EZ Up tension rod, courtesy of the Amazon Vine program. As tension rods go, this is pretty standard operation procedure once you figure out how to lock it after extending the middle portion. My trick is to overshoot the length by a fraction of an inch and then push the rod into its position. (The method of increasing tension while the rod is already in its intended place never works for me---it resulted in too little force.) The plastic ends on this rod seem ok in quality, and I have no doubt that it would probably work for over a year. However, I don't know why but I can see rust spots (more precisely rust-colored water drops that eventually dried on the bottom of the rod) sets in after just a month. I believe this is from condensation during showers. Since I use the rod to hang laundry, I am not sure I will keep this because I am afraid there may be rust drips ruining the clothes. To be fair, there was never any mention of ""stainless"" in the product description and I am indeed not using it for shower curtain, which is what this product primarily targets. However, even if it is just my shower curtain, I would not like to see the rust spots. 2/5.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9WCS1W9CQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PGQHT4#wasThisHelpful","RX9WCS1W9CQ1","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Black & Decker EHC3002B Glass Bowl Chopper, Black” for review. The major components inside the box are the motorized chopper itself and two 4-cup glass bowls with lids. There are also the chopping blade and a splatter guard.This is actually pretty genius design: the chopper fits over the splatter guard, which in turn fits on top of the included storage glass bowls. (Although the bowls have Black+Decker imprints, I tested it with 4-cup bowls from a “Py” brand and it works equally well.)In practice, you would put the ingredients in after you rest the blade into the bowls, then continue with the splatter guard and the chopper motor. There are two buttons: low and high, with one and two very small protruding dots on the buttons itself that are barely sufficient for my fingers to tell.The manual includes a chopping guide (which really can be summarized as “use high always, unless you want to make a spread”). It also contains a number of recipes: Caramel Apple Dip, Cream Cheese Icing, Blue Cheese Dressing, Rotisserie Chicken Salad, Fresh Tomato Salsa, and Spinach Artichoke Dip.Honestly my housemate and I have not tried anything other than the salsa (which was the primary reason we decided to get this). In this regard this B&D chopper performs brilliantly. The reason is because there are very few things to wash: you see, the blade goes into the bowl itself, and once the chopping is done, there is NO need for any salsa transfer. The unused portion can be stored inside the glass container with the included lids. We especially appreciate the glass bowls: with plastic you often get left-over odors, but with glass there is no such problem.Overall, we are very impressed with this B&D chopper. I wouldn't go so far to say that we don't know how we would have lived without it, but I would say that this really has increased our frequency of making salsa at home. Highly recommended if you chop a lot of things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38V3FDP6YY697/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK13Y#wasThisHelpful","R38V3FDP6YY697","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “iDevices IGR0009 iGrill2 Bluetooth Thermometer” for review. Inside the box are the iGrill2 itself, two AA batteries that can support the iGrill2 for 20 hours, 2 “Pro meat probes”, 2 probe wraps (for coiling the wire), 2 probe color tags to tell the probes apart, a magnetic holder for the iGrill2, an optional magnetic disc in case you want to stick the holder on a non-magnetic surface, and a brief instruction sheet. It comes with one year of warranty.In short, the iGrill2 is a grill thermometer that can support 4 probes at maximum. There is not much user interface in the iGrill2 itself: it only has an on/off button, a cycle button to go through the probe temperatures, and when there is an alert it has a very tiny beeper that really you should not rely on hearing, especially not outdoor. The actual UI is on a phone app (as of this writing they support both iOS and Android).The meat probes seem accurate in my experience over this holiday for briskets and birds. The smoked brisket presented a power challenge since one of our recipes last 18 hours even before resting. The iGrill2 ran out of power at the end. (No big deal, but I think next time we will really try to use fresh batteries and try again.)I have compared them with my trusted ThermaPen and the readings are rarely ever more than 4F away from each other. This is the most important benchmark and iGrill2 scores high on this. I also appreciate that the iGrill2 probes seem to be quite consistent across each other. For example, the two probes that are shipped to me detects the room temperature at a max of 1F off from each other. This is very good quality control.The probe wraps help keep the probe wires neat in storage. They also snap into a stack vertically: you can stack the probe wraps on top of each other by pushing the protrusion at the top to the groove at the bottom. I consider this a major upgrade from one of my previous grill thermometers without a wire management system: when I store that one the probe wire is always a mess in the drawer. Clearly the iGrill2 is great for neat freaks.The magnetic holder is also nicely designed to hold the iGrill2 at about 20 degrees off. You can snap the iGrill2 into the holder in two ways that are 180 degree rotations of each other. If you are mounting the holder on a vertical surface, you can have the iGrill2 tilt up 20 degrees from the bottom so you can see it better from the top. If you are placing it horizontally, then you can have the iGrill2 tilt up 20 degrees from the back so you can see it better from the front. The bonus magnetic disc is also a very thoughtful touch. In my case I stick the disc on the stone surface in my kitchen so that the holder will stay in place when used with the oven.Of course, the most important component that is not in the box but absolutely necessary for the daily operation is the app itself. I use an Android phone, and since this is the iGrill2 I installed the iDevice Connect app, which is about 24MB as of this writing. (Confusingly iDevices also have an app that is called iGrill, but that only supports iGrill1.)The app is pretty sophisticated. Besides displaying the temperatures of the probes, the app designer has put in a lot of thoughts. Upon the insertion of a probe, it will guide you through setting up the probe. You will tell it the color of the probe you have just inserted, and it will present you with an extensive menu of common food items and their recommended temperature at a particular “done-ness”. Hit the start button and you are good to go.There are actually two types of alerts: peak (beep with a temperature is reached) and range (beep when temperature is outside a hi, lo range). Whenever there is an alert the phone will show a notification and the iGrill2 will also emit a tiny beep. It can show the temperature of each probe on its own graph, just like what you see in the stock market. Finally, it can also let you set up your own custom alerts.The app has some quirks as of this writing. First, I really hate the way their non-committing changes. Say you go into set up a temperature alert. After you pick a temperature, you need to be careful to use the Save button on the top to commit the change. If you use the Back button, you lose the setting. No modern app does this any more: all changes should be saved at Back. Then, the color scheme is pretty odd. At the temperature alert screen, the bottom shows the two types Peak and Range. Guess what, when you are in the Peak mode the text “Peak” is in grey and the text “Range” is in bright white! (And vice versa.) I sometimes get confused because of this. Finally, the menu at the bottom does not swipe in. Instead, you are supposed to click on it and a menu will slide up. I hope iDevices will fix these quirks.Compared to all my previous grill thermometers, be it the wire type or the ThermaPen, I find iGrill2 to be superior. The number one weakness of the ThermaPen is that you need to open the grill/oven door to insert the probe. With the iGrill2, this is no longer a problem. The Bluetooth range is adequate and I get at least 50 feet. My deck is outside the kitchen, and I have no trouble monitoring the grill through the glass windows. However, the signal drops when I am in the living room, which is separated from the deck through the kitchen and a stone wall. The iGrill2's price is steep, but honestly if the probes don't give up then this is actually a great buy! (I will come back to update this review if the probes die.)P.S. The app also allows you connect to other iGrill2 users through the “Globe” feature, which I did not use since I don't do this social network thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZO774SYLTNVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC4KU42#wasThisHelpful","R2ZO774SYLTNVC","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Altra Furniture Galaxy TV Stand with Mount for TVs up to 50-Inch, Walnut Finish” for review.I live in a city apartment, and space is at a premium. Before this I have been putting my 43-inch TV on top of a IKEA media center using the TV's integrated stand. There is nothing wrong with my existing setup, but I figure I can give this Altra a try.The out-of-the-box experience is pretty good. The package is heavy, and when UPS came the box was slightly damaged. It worries me quite a bit since there is wood inside. Fortunately, the content inside the box is well-padded and there is no damage. There are about a dozen items in the box, mostly the composite wood panels, the glass “in-the-air” panel, the metal TV frame, and a whole bunch of screws to put them together.The actual assembling takes 25 minutes for me. I know I can probably do it faster, but I was taking caution because I want to make sure it does not wobble since the last thing I want is to see my TV crushing onto my Xbone... I am glad that the patience paid-off, and once the center column is assembled, it neatly mounts onto the bottom plate without difficulty. The middle glass shelf, however, is a bit more work. In my stand the glass has a tiny bit of give in one of the slots in the center column. It's so small that a penny won't fit (I think even half the thickness of a penny won't fit). I ended up cutting a piece of small plastic from the milk jug and it fixes the problem satisfactorily.The actual assembled stand is larger than I thought, but this is mostly due to the stand's foot that extends to the front to make sure the stand does not tip forward. I don't have any wall space for the stand to lean on, and therefore I rearranged the living room so that this stands at a corner, offsetting it at 45 degrees. It works ok for stability since the two sides of the TV is what prevents the stand from tipping backward.For the asking price I think this is a pretty good deal. The wood finish looks real enough and does not seem to scratch, and the glass panel seems sturdy (modulo the fitting problem I described above). While it offers about a feet of height adjustability of the TV, it does not allow vertical tilt. I ended up mounting the TV at its minimal height, which is ok but still a bit high for my taste. I guess I will get used to it.The two shelves (if you call the foot a shelf) are open to the air and so is the center column. As a result, dust does collect on them. (My previous media center have glass doors on the front to keep the dust out). This can be a real problem if you are OCD about it.Overall this is a very minimalistic TV stand. The TV mount is pretty sturdy, and I like the fact that the cables are all hidden except where they exit the bottom of the stand. It's not premium by any standard, but I do find it comparable to IKEA items. If you are renting or if you want to mount your TV higher but do not want to drill your wall, I can recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPF43QP0TNI8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HAR2A1I#wasThisHelpful","RPF43QP0TNI8M","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Tile for iOS - For Finding Anything and Everything (Retail Packaging)” for review.This is essentially a weather-sealed bluetooth transponder that has a battery life of one year. You pair it with your phone, register your email address with Tile's website, and the app will activate the Tile (otherwise it seems to just turn off after a few minute---yes, I did try to pair it with an Android device just for fun). Every couple minutes the app will try to scan for all the tiles it can see around your phone  (about 100 feet radius), and report the location of these tiles to the server. If one of these tiles is yours, you can also see its location in the app.I know quite a few friends who backed this, though I myself didn't. It is an interesting concept, but it seems to suffer from the classic problem of bootstrapping. But since this review is about the product and not the business idea, I will stick with my experience with the product and the service *as of today* (it may dramatically improve in a few months once more people sign up).The most major pro of Tile over its competitors is its weather-sealing. Being water-resistant (though not water-proof) is good since you never know when you will splash some liquid on it. But that also effectively make the battery inside each Tile non-replaceable. A built-in expiry day of one year? I mean, even if you are getting the 12-pack, that's still 15 bucks per year per tile to be thrown away. (And if you get the 12-pack each year you are throwing 180 bucks away.) And to conserve battery, the beeper is not very loud---certainly not loud enough for a restaurant.The cons list is, unfortunately, quite a bit longer.First, their app is a phone-battery eater. Before installing this app I can almost cruise through a second work day if I forget to charge the phone the night before. This app made this impossible: every night the battery is almost dead when I go to bed. While I think they can tune the frequency of scanning, their sales literature made it clear that it cannot be too infrequent: the app is designed to scan for other tiles periodically to support the lost-n-found feature.Putting the environment issue aside, I still find the location function lacking, though this is really not the Tile's fault. Tile does not have any GPS real-time tracking location. Instead, it relies on the phones that see it to report the location. The problem is that most phones are just not very good at its location. At the moment my phone thinks I am sitting on the street outside, 12-floor down.The form factor is also not very pleasing. It measures 1.5 inch on both length and width and 3/16 in thickness. I have seen sales picture of sticking a Tile to a violin or putting it inside a wallet. I am not sure about you, but I don't think it can comfortably fit in my wallet. (I tried, and it stretches the leather.) Seriously, the last couple times I lost something in a restaurant/bar, the thing I lost is actually the phone itself... but at this thickness, there is no way I will do it.Overall, I like the concept of keeping track of things. I am just not sure Bluetooth LE is the solution to that. And even if it is, I find Tile's implementation as of today to be a bit premature. This is definitely an early-adopter technology.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0WCNIUW02YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PA7A3LY#wasThisHelpful","RK0WCNIUW02YO","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Saris The Boss Single Bike Storage, White” for review. This is an interesting item that I didn't know I had a need for, but after using it for a month now I wonder why I didn't notice I had a need for it. :)I bike to work everyday when the weather is dry, and usually when I get into the office I just put the bike on the wall. Over time, the handle has rubbed some rubber onto the wall where I usually rest my bike. My office manager didn't seem to mind it.At least that's what I thought.The Saris is a very simple device. Think of it as a flat stand with a vertical fork that can hold the rear axis of the bike (the product photo is very illustrative here). The fork has some rubber/silicone coating to prevent scratching, and there is absolutely no adjustment other than the a slide lock that locks the fork in its place (when it is shipped the fork is bent towards the plate to minimize the package size).The entire device is not that heavy, and so it surprised me a bit that in practice it is very effective in holding my bike. The fork is easy to use, and so far I have zero trouble with it.For all these, and the fact that this is very affordable, I am giving this Saris a five star.Let me end with my office manager. He walked by one afternoon after I started using this Saris, and he said “oh, I always wished that you would install a kick-stand on your bike; this one is quite nice, where did you get it?” That evening he had the custodian clean the rubber marks off the wall using glue-gone.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a ""Jolie Sustainable Luxury Candle, vanille"" for review. This is in essence a vanilla soy wax candle.This is my introduction to soy wax candle. Compared to some other normal scented candles, I notice that there is less smoke during burning and there is also less smell from the wax itself. These are very good characteristics to have since they translate to more smell from the vanilla oil.However, I have to agree with many other reviewers that this is one expensive candle if I have to buy it by myself. 6oz really is not that big at all, and making things worse is that the vanilla smell in this candle is very faint to my nose. This means it is less effective at scenting a room than I would like.The bottom-line is I honestly think you have to be looking for a luxury to like this candle. Yes, the 40 hour claim is at the right ballpark so long as you remember to trim the wick, and the candle is very high-quality in its components (from wax to wick to the glass).

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Vornado SRTH Small Room Tower Heater, White” for review.This heater is really small. At barely a feet tall and six inches wide, I initially have some doubt on its capability to keep my room warm. At the top of the tower is a 4-hour timer button and a power knob that allows me to select among power off, fan-only, low, and high. This Vornado also features a (by-now standard) safety shut-off when tipped.Vornado's sales literature claims that this heater uses their V-Flow heat circulation technology. Compared to the more traditional space heater design that uses a fan to blow forward, you can imagine that in this Vornado the fan is blowing towards multiple grilles in many different directions in an attempt to disperses the hot air into a wider span. This is similar to how air conditioning works in a passenger car.I use this in my office, which is about 100 sq ft. Despite the sales claim, I have to report that in practice this Vornado makes very little difference in heating when compared to my existing heat fan made by Holmes. They both heat up the office at the same speed at the same power consumption. Notice that I am not using the space heater underneath my desk to keep my feet warm. Instead, I am trying to keep the office a few degrees higher than the building's heat default. Therefore, I did not need to use the oscillation on the Holmes since the fan is not directly blowing hot air towards my legs, which is what many of my colleagues do. However, notice that this Vornado will also be relatively ineffective in this application since the heat is not so focused.So how do I justify my 4/5 rating? It turns out that if you care about noise, then this Vornado is in fact quite a bit quieter than my Holmes heat fan. The consistent problem with my Holmes is that it makes a very audible difference in sound when it switches on and off when regulated by the thermostat. This Vornado, on the other hand, makes a constant noise that eventually becomes a white noise. However, of course if you care about noise you would use a silent heater such as an oil heater. An oil heater is slow to warm up, though these days many of them come with a timer that allows you to turn it on in advance.Overall, I think this is a fine small room heater that gets the job done, but I didn't feel any magic with the V-Flow. Since the 4 hour timer is rather inflexible, I am taking a star off. 4/5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUSJORY526ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0WOOA6#wasThisHelpful","RSUSJORY526ZZ","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “TP-LINK TL-WA854RE N300 Universal Wireless Range Extender, Wall Plug, Plug&Play, Smart Signal Indicator Light” for review. I had high hopes for this range extender since I have a fitting application for it. However, it turned out to be quite a frustrating experience to set it up the way it is intended to work...The wireless signal from our cable modem in the living room has always left us wanting in the bedroom. In theory, this range extender is the perfect solution if we plug it in the dinette, which is situated right in-between the living room and the bedroom.The out-of-the-box experience is quite nice. I'd say that these days most vendors have adopted (or “copied”) from Apple well enough that the device feels exquisite. There is a nicely folded manual, a drive cd (that I don't care for), and the repeater itself.The manual is very clear: there are two methods to set this up. Method one is WDS, which is supposedly easier, but we cannot use it since we don't want to mess with the cable modem. Instead, we use method two: boot the repeater, associate a computer with a temporary access point exposed by the repeater, and then configure it to repeat the signal from the cable modem.We are able to associate with the temporary access point with no problem (the default login credential is printed on the manual). Then we made the first mistake: the default setting is to have the range extender use the same wireless network name as the cable modem. To be sure, it works, but it turns out one of our smartphones gets confused by the presence of two wireless networks each with the same name and the same password. It gets so confused that the wifi driver on the phone keeps crashing. We figure that we should change the wireless network name. To be fair I am not taking any points off due to this: after all it's our own phone that has problem.Resetting the range extender is easy: just hold a pin-sized button for 10 seconds and it will reset and reboot. The second time we tell the range extender to expose a wireless network under a different name. In other words, the uplink for the range extender runs in the same network as the cable modem, and it itself presents another wireless network. We reconfigured all our phones, tablets, and laptops to use this newer network, and everything worked flawlessly.At least for a while.We made the second mistake by following the manual's suggestion to relocate the range extender. You see, the manual suggested us to set up the repeater somewhere close to the cable modem, and then unplug it to relocate to the designated location (which is the dinette for us). However, after relocation, the range extender cannot join the cable modem's network reliably. The repeater will hang a few seconds after booting up. We had to unplug and plug it in 5 times for it to finally latch on the network.So we thought this must be a firmware problem and we went to the TP-Link's firmware download page. Sure enough TP-Link is already aware of the problem. On 8/27/2014 they have released a new firmware version that “Fixed a BUG that device sometimes may not connect to the main router after relocation/reboot.” However, we did not dare to install this firmware since it is for hardware revision “'TL-WA854RE(EU) V1” and the review unit we received is “US v1.1”. Duh!In the end, we spent over an hour to figure all these out: pick a different network name, and do not try to relocate it. I hope I have provided you with some entertainment. :PDuring the setup time my housemate and I were both quite astonished: both of us have computer science degrees, and so while it was frustrating we knew how to move forward since we wanted to write this review. However, if we are consumers who paid for this, we would have definitely returned it half an hour into the game. I hope TP-Link would release a firmware for the US hardware version and flash it on as soon as possible. Otherwise, I predict Amazon will have a lot of “warehouse deals” (returned goods) on this model.We are giving it a 4/5 since it actually works as advertised... except it does require a lot more fiddling than we would expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJL89JOI9GEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVIXCCO#wasThisHelpful","RHJL89JOI9GEF","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried all four popular speakerphones in the $100 range you can find on Amazon: Philips WeCall, Logitech P710e, Jabra SPEAK 510, and Plantronics Calisto 620. If you are ok with using the WeCall over USB, you should buy it *now*---it has no competition!Inside the box there is the WeCall, a USB-to-microUSB cable, a travel case, and a very thin manual. You really don't need the manual since everything is very intuitive. The WeCall has four buttons on top: Answer/Hangup, Mic Mute (just mic, not the speaker), Volume Up, and Volume Down. On the bottom there is a slide button for Power, a push button to initiate Bluetooth pairing, and a slide bottom to choose between USB and Bluetooth. The form factor is a square spanning about 4.25 inch in each direction, and it barely breaks an inch at its thickest point, which is at the center since the top is dome-shaped.The Philips WeCall excels in what it is supposed to do, namely as a speakerphone. For now, let's forget about Bluetooth and focus on using it over USB.The speaker is good quality. At its highest volume it can easily fill a 20-feet-by-20-feet room. The voice is clear with no distortion. There can be no complaint.Philips's magic is in the microphone part: WeCall boosts 4 microphones and this allows Philips to pick up my voice at a moderate distance while performing noise cancellation. (Plantronics has 2, and Logitech and Jabra both have 1). I know in principle some digital signal processing can help and this is what the other manufacturers will tell you. But this is my experience in the same room: At 1 feet all these speakerphones equally clear. But at 3 feet, only the Plantronics and the Philips are usable, and the Logitech is ok if you are facing the front direction. At 6-12feet, only the Philips can pick up clearly. The Philips WeCall is truly amazing when you have more than 2 people in the room.(At over 12 feet, I have positive experience only on a PolyCom. We do not have budget for the Internet (IP) version of PolyCom. But who uses landline these days? Plus, it is not portable.)So why are some of the reviewers not so happy with the WeCall? I believe that's because they are using the WeCall over Bluetooth. In this mode, I have yet to meet a speakerphone that performs satisfactorily. The WeCall still performs better than the other three, but I notice a sharp quality degrade once I am more than three feet away. (Note that for the experiment I have the WeCall communicate with my MacBook Pro at exactly the same location as it was when I was using USB. Also, I have tried plugging the WeCall into a power source under the theory that maybe in the Bluetooth mode it needs to conserve battery. Still, no change.)Our entire office is very happy with the WeCall and it has really enabled us to turn any room into a conference room. In fact, I bought one for my home, and my collaborators from remote sites also bought the WeCall given their positive experience when teleconferencing with us.Bottom line is: this is a solid 5/5 and I recommend it without hesitation. It is perfect if you are ok with using it over USB, and it still beats the competition in Bluetooth mode.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20O8XT45EZGAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH0ESYK#wasThisHelpful","R20O8XT45EZGAL","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Paderno World Cuisine 4-Blade Spiralizer” for review. Like many reviewers, I have purchased the 3-blade version before and so I guess this is why Amazon thinks I should check out this upgraded 4-blade version.A spiralizer is a very specialized kitchen device in that it can do only one thing: essentially you use a rotating handle to push food towards a mounted blade, and on the other side comes out the sliced food. I primarily use it to cut zucchini and cucumber strands for salad. For this I use the “spaghetti” blade, where the strands have a diameter that is roughly that of a cooked spaghetti. There is also a fancy blade that can cut a potato into spiral accordion, although I honestly have not ever done it.In this upgraded version, you get a new “angle hair” blade that cuts very thin strands. I tried very hard to appreciate this new capability. However, given my typical use for zucchini and cucumber, I don't really think I need this new blade since this new blade is not so suitable to cut these softer veggies. It makes perfect sense if you think about it: softer veggies have trouble going through the smaller holes without getting squashed.The construction on this new 4-blade version is every bit as good as the old version. The white plastic is very sturdy, and the blades appear to be equally sharp on my copy. Now this is only 2 months in and so I cannot comment on long-term sharpness. If it significantly deteriorates later, I will surely come back to update the review.In the end, I know you will be asking if the 3-blade is a better value. For my usage, the two are indeed the same and so the lower asking price of the 3-blade seems tempting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFLN54MAPY84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AW3B5MM#wasThisHelpful","R2SFLN54MAPY84","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Dirt Devil SD40050 Dash Bagless Canister” for advance review. This is the sixth vacuum cleaner I have reviewed for Amazon though this is the first canister in the six and also the second in my life.Frankly, I am not a fan of canister since I live in a colder climate (western Pennsylvania) and even fancy canister vacs struggle on carpets. The reason is just laws of physics: on an upright the weight helps you push on the carpet a bit more, and on a canister you have to do the pushing.This Dirt Devil is not a fancy canister, but it is very capable if you have extremely thin carpet (like our office) or hardwood (like my kitchen). The vac has an easy to use foot pedal on the brush to choose between these two settings. I have tried it on both surfaces and unsurprisingly it works much better on the hardwood floor.This Dirt Devil have two major selling points. First, it is bagless with a HEPA filter. This works well in practice. My previous canister is a Miele that retails for over six times the asking price of this Dirt Devil, but that one is bagged. So while the Miele wins in its raw suction power hands down, the Miele does require frequent bag replacement to keep its advantage. In this regard, I actually prefer this Dirt Devil: no bags means the suction remains high regardless of bag fill, and you don't have to keep buying bags (and honestly the Miele bags are not cheap). The only required maintenance on this Dirt Devil is to wash the HEPA filter periodically.The second selling point is that it can be fitted with a so-called “Vac+Dust Floor Tool with Swipe”, at least according to Amazon's webpage and the user manual. However, the vac that got shipped to me does NOT have the Swipe head, and so I cannot review this feature.While this is a good bag-less vac, it certainly is in the entry-level. The reason is the included accessories. There there is basically one “3-in-1 tool” that can be fitted on the hose. The tool can be clumsily converted among three modes: crevice, bristle brush, and lint brush. Given the price point, I find this a fair level of quality.All things considered, I find this vac to be a nice introduction to bag-less vacuum cleaners. If you have thin office-style carpet (no loft) or hardwood, and if you are looking for a bag-less vac, this Dirt Devil gets my recommendation. Just make sure you leave plenty of room for storing it: the hose does not compress well and it occupies considerable space in the closet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4W9UVNGRYBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4MHJH8#wasThisHelpful","R3R4W9UVNGRYBU","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Kyocera CFP26BK Ceramic Nonstick Fry Pan, 10-Inch” for review.I have not been using non-stick pans for almost 10 years out of potential health issues with the non-stick coating. In the last few years I have been hearing about all these ceramic pans in the stores. However, since I am quite happy with the non-stick performance of my seasoned carbon-steel fry pan, I never bothered to check them out. Well, until this pan shows up on my Vine list...Upon arrival I immediately noticed the high-quality construction of the pan. The pan seems sturdy and it has survived Amazon's no-padding shipping. The handle is super nice: it is 100% smooth and does not have any sharp edges to dig into your hand. The bottom of the pan is essentially smooth, so you need not worry about scratching in case you are using a glasstop (I myself use gas).Kyocera is well known for their ceramics and I have been using their ceramic knives for over 10 years. According to the packaging, this pan uses a proprietary ceramic non-stick coating known as Kyo Glaze and it is supposed to be oven safe up to 400F and also comes with a one-year warranty. The glaze is said to be metal-utensil safe and it is free of PTFE and PFOA.Of course, the real test is in actual cooking. After having used it for over a month, I find myself using this pan more often than I thought. The handle shape is really nice and the handle is mostly cool to touch. Food releases very well, though it also suffers from a lack of caramelization just like other non-stick pans. I tried using a metal spatula inside when I fry a fish fillet (which is a struggle since this pan is 10 inch only) and the glaze does seem to hold up. The cleaning is a snap, or I should say a swipe---there is really nothing to clean other than swiping a soaped sponge over and rinse. In the last month, I have tried cooking pan cakes, fish fillets, eggs, and also a risotto. Nothing sticked.So what's not to like about this pan? Very little. If I really need to pick on it would be on heat distribution. The bottom of the pan seems to have special embedding to help heat distribution, but still it is very thin and it is very obvious on a gas stove. For example, the center of a pancake is often quite a bit more browned than the edges. My cast iron pan is perfect for this. I am also not so hot on the lack of caramelization---I really like my fish fillet to have a crispy crust and this barely makes it. Finally, at 10 inch this pan is a tad small, though it is less of a problem because the side is relatively straight.Overall, I am quite impressed with this Kyocera pan. If this pan ends up wearing out, I will be quite happy to replace it with an equivalent 12 inch. (That is assuming that no new health issues come out with ceramics.)P.S. I also did a magnetic test: yes, magnets stick to the bottom and so you should be able to use this on an inductive stove.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LX3W6R7GX3Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5HE646#wasThisHelpful","R2LX3W6R7GX3Y5","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine Program, I have received an “OXO Good Grips POP Cereal and Snack Dispensing Canister” for review. This series comes in three sizes 2.5Qt, 3.4Qt, and 4.5Qt and I am reviewing the medium size here.At its most basic, this is an air-tight canister with a pop lid: you push on one side of the lid and the other side pops up. The air-tightness comes from the silicone gaskets on the lid and around the pop up. OXO lists two other major features, namely a smooth-pour spout and a contoured grip.To put this canister to test, I fill it up with my favorite breakfast cereal, which happens to be the good old corn flakes. There are quite a few things to like. First, the contoured grip really helps gripping the canister. Second, the air-tightness indeed seems to work ok: In the past, I would notice the flakes getting softer as the week progresses due to moisture absorption. (I did not used to put the opened bag into a container.) However, now that I have this canister, I just empty the bag into the canister in a batch and the problem seems to have gone away. Yay!Over my use, I am not sure the smooth-pour sprout really makes any difference though. The truth is I never have any problem pouring out my cereal. In fact, given the size of the opening, I will be surprised if this can make any difference.Overall, we all know that OXO makes good items and this is no exception. The plastic is BPA-free, and the construction seems high quality and durable. The lid is asymmetric, and therefore you always put it on in the correct orientation so that the grip and the sprout are on opposite side. The pop out part of the lid is also detachable for thorough cleaning, although honestly I won't bother doing that. Now OXO did not list if the item is dish-washer safe, and so I have to assume that the gaskets are better washed manually.Other than the what I consider to be slightly high asking price, there is really nothing to fault. OXO easily earns 5/5 here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DQVR6I3ZVFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X4ZAI#wasThisHelpful","R13DQVR6I3ZVFV","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received an “Ambient Weather BC-2000 Intelligent Battery Charger for AA/AAA Rechargeable Batteries” for review. I guess Amazon picked me to review this charger because I have just purchased a PowerEx MH-C9000 Wizardone Charger a few years ago. :)First, let me describe the BC-2000 briefly. Inside the box you have the charger itself, a small 12V-1A power supply unit, and a short but quite detailed manual (argh... the tiny font size). The charger can charge both AA and AAA out of the box, and also bigger batteries like C and D if you buy a converter. (And just to be sure, there is no rechargeable batteries included, which, to me, is a good thing).To a MH-C9000 veteran, this BC-2000 gives a similar feel, but it is less sophisticated and also arguably (due to being less sophisticated) easier to operate in a normal day-to-day operation---to charge a batch of batteries. The standard operation procedure is this: you push in 1 to 4 batteries with no more than 6 seconds delay in-between each, then up the current from 200mA to your desired current by pushing the Current button, then the charger will start charging each battery intelligently (won't overcharge) and independently (neighboring batteries does not affect each other's charging). This compares favorably on my MH-C9000, which requires you to push an Enter button for each battery. (However, see below.)As the manual stated, if you are charging 1 or 2 batteries, you want to place them on slots 1 and 4 (the outermost). This will allow you to select up to 1400mA. If you put them in the middle two slots, then you can select up to 1000mA only. When charging 3 batteries, put them in slots 1 through 3 but only slot 1 can be at 1400mA (the other two will be at 1000mA). When charging 4 batteries, every slot is limited to 1000mA. If you think this is way too complicated and perhaps somewhat restricting, it's  because it is true... Indeed, the MH-C9000 does not have this restriction and it can in fact go to 2000mA on each slot (that is one of the reasons why the power supply unit on the MH-C9000 is rated at 12V-2A).Of course, there are other functions on the BC-2000. Besides charging, it can perform discharge to measure battery capacity. There is also a refresh mode that charges and discharges a battery repeatedly to refresh/break into an old battery. (And if we limit the number of cycles to one, it's called test mode on the BC-2000.) Finally, there is also a quick test mode which discharges a battery for about 10 seconds and measures its internal resistance. (A high resistance means you should replace the battery.)Overall, I really like the BC-2000's simplicity in its most frequent usage mode of charging. I think of it as a slightly fancier version of a high-quality charger that often comes in a bundle with rechargeable batteries (such as the Sanyo NC-MQR02N that are often bundled with Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries). The fanciness is because you get to choose the charging current and also perform other functions like cycling. The MH-C9000 is about 50 – 70 % more expensive, and the only difference is the interface and the ability to charge at a higher current (but you rarely want to do that... usually you charge at half the battery rating... so for a 2000mAh battery you charge at around 1000mAh, and some people even recommend slightly lower). So between the BC-2000 and the MH-C9000, there is really very little reason to go with the latter. I happened to picked MH-C9000 since there was a good deal due to Amazon's dynamic pricing, but for my usage I can totally go with the BC-2000 just as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343DNYR13BVMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUZHL4C#wasThisHelpful","R343DNYR13BVMQ","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a ""PowerCube Extended USB, Electric Outlet Adapter 5ft Extension Cord Power Strip with 4 outlets, Dual USB Port and Resettable Fuse PC-4400-USEUPC"" for review. Inside the easy-to-open box is the power strip itself, a brief manual printed at the back of the cardboard packaging, two stickers, and a plastic mount.The power strip itself is heavy-duty. You can tell it is serious stuff by the thickness of the 5-feet cable to the wall. It is rated at 125V and 15A. There is a fuse and from their website it is rated at 16A.There are two innovations in the cube-shaped strip. First, the four sockets are on the four sides of the cube. This means it can easily accommodate four ""power bricks"" adaptors with no worry to block so long as the brick is within 2.5 inch thick. The designer further reduces the chance of blocking by orienting the sockets differently: two of the opposing sockets is aligned in the up-down direction and the other two opposing sockets is aligned in the left-right direction. Very clever.The second innovation is in the two integrated USB charging ports. Being USB, the two ports are rated at 5V. The output is listed as 2.1A, and it is not clear from the literature nor the packaging whether this is a combined 2.1A across the two ports, or 2.1A per port. (One iPad can use 2.4A, but I don't have two iPads to test concurrent charging.)The plastic mount can be snapped on one of the sockets in a snap-and-twist motion. The idea is that you mount the plastic mount underneath a table top using either the two supplied stickers or by screws (screws not supplied). Once done you can easily snap a power cube underneath your table. I did not test this since I use a glass table top. The stickers also look flimsy... no sure it can hold the weight anyway.Overall, I am quite impressed with the design of this power cube. Although it sports only four sockets (there is another version that does not have USB ports and instead has an extra socket), I like the overall aesthetics of it. It also comes with two years of warranty. I have contacted the vendor to check if the USB ports are rated at 2.1A each or combined. (If it is combined, I will come back to update.)UPDATE: I communicated with the designing firm and they confirmed that it's 2.1A COMBINED. Be ware of the implication. For example, charging one iPad alone will consume all the available power. I am taking a star off since this is really a missed opportunity. I'd rather seeing the cube goes a bit more expensive and support at least 3.5A. (One phone plus one iPad doesn't seem much these days...)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149P6K9T72K4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPNH4LC#wasThisHelpful","R149P6K9T72K4Q","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “K'nex Hyperspeed Hangtime Roller Coaster Building Set” for review. The set comes well-packaged in the shipping box (it's huge, and it matters given how UPS/Fedex treats packages), and inside the set are a large number of pieces, (620 to be exact), and you need to provide 3 'C' size batteries (it's the one size bigger than 'AA'). I have not purchased such batteries for almost 10 years now, but they are well-stocked at retailers and are easy to find.We tested this with our neighbors 10-year-old, who is very much into Lego but has never heard of K'nex before. He has extensive experience Lego sets with large number of pieces, and so 620 is a 'medium size' for him.School has started at this time of the year, and so it took him 2 evenings to finish building, though it is obvious that by the end of the first evening it's mostly done. In total, he built it without adult intervention in under 3 hours. (I think he takes it as a challenge to build it as quickly as possible. This is not intended.) The set looks impressive in size, and the inversion makes the roller coaster quite a bit more fun to look at. The fact tha K'nex is not 100% rigid actually makes the coaster more interesting to look at: when the car moves around the whole set jiggles a little bit, especially at the electric 'launch' at the base.The kid's impression to the K'nex was good and here are a few comments. First, while the color coding makes it easy to build, the end result is a bit less attractive visually (to him anyway). (Constrast this with Lego, where the same piece can come in different colors.) Second, the instruction is very clear and easy to follow, and there is actually a second set of downloadable instructions for another coaster. He likes that this is not a “one tricky pony”. (And since this is his introduction to K'nex, he doesn't have any spare set to invent another build yet. I imagine this is possible, just like Lego.) His mom appreciates the toy, but commented that it takes up a lot of space in the living room and so it's not obvious that they will keep it there for long. After all it is a display item: once you have built it, there is nothing else other than an infinite loop. Indeed, a week later when we visit again the kid is no longer paying attention to it. (This is not unique to K'nex; many kids these days cannot stay on one toy for too long.)Overall, this is a good introduction to K'nex. If you have the space, it can even be an attractive display. However, we feel that to get the most out of K'nex you need to invest in the system, and in this regard we feel that K'nex is a bit specialized (in this regard we have to agree that Lego is a lot more versatile).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O937EA195KTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFVGYGK#wasThisHelpful","R3O937EA195KTE","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Francois et Mimi Large Stainless Steel Double Wall French Coffee Press,50oz” and a “Francois et Mimi Brushed Finish Stainless Steel Double Wall French Coffee Press,34oz” for review. Since the two items are similar except for the look and capacity, I am writing this one review for both. I will specifically comment on each of them after I get through their common points.Francois et Mimi is a new brand to me. As French sounding as the brand is, the coffee presses are both made in China. (I don't want to start any argument here, but I state this as an FYI.) These are the first fully-metal french press I have ever used. I am compelled to review these due to a simple and obvious reason: since they are made of metal only, they cannot break, at least not easily. In practice I did manage to drop one of them into the sink by accident (or rather, lack of caffeine right after waking up), and sure enough nothing broke. Great!Another reason for the metal design is that these pots are supposed to be insulated by double walls and so they retain heat. This is where you need to set your expectation right. The heat-retention effect is very noticeable to be sure, but it is not in the same league as Thermos (or lately, Rubbermaid) and so you should not expect these to double as an insulated carafe. (In fact, there is a tiny opening next to the spout and hot air can still escape.)But how well does the idea of heat-retention work for coffee? Well, I am sorry to report that I don't get the design at all. You see, brewing coffee with french press has a problem: if you don't empty the pot after pressing you risk over-extraction. I just don't see any use where I will want to press the coffee in the pot and leave the coffee in. In other words, for my daily use there won't be any hot coffee to be left in the pot to keep warm! I didn't realize this until I have slightly ruined my first pot. Oh well... And unlike the newest breed of french presses that try to compress the pressed grind into a pallet to prevent over-extraction (at least in theory), these Francois et Mimi are the old-school design where the grind is still loose. Definite a high risk.The smaller of the two (34oz) is matte and it actually looks quite nice in person. The large one is mirror-finished and, like all other items of such finish, it is a fingerprint magnet. Other than these two factors, the two are virtually identical.Honestly, with my preference of not over-extracting coffee I really don't see much use of this design.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a ""Verilux VT10WW1 HappyLight Liberty Natural Spectrum Lamp, 5K Energy"" for review. Inside the box is a simple one-piece box lamp and a brief manual.[EDIT] The 5K refers to the intensity of light (5000 LUX). (Previously, I thought it was the color temperature.) The color of the bulb is in fact also very close to 5K, which is similar to broad daylight. It's much more ""blue""/""cooler"" than the typical yellow light from an incandescent bulb, and skin tone look fantastic in this light. Since it mimics daylight, it is also believed (and with some scientific evidence) that this helps to improve mood.While I am not qualified to verify the science, I can speak of my experience as a user. It's summer here in the Northern hemisphere and therefore there is no lack of sunshine during the day. But I am in the computer industry which happens to involve a lot of night time. For this, I want to know how well this Verilux mimics daylight. The answer: Verilux does it very well. In the past month I have used it in the evening while I am still in the office and I can attest that its light does keep me alert for quite a bit longer than I initially think such a small light can. The trick, it seems, is the angle. This Verilux lamp happens to be a small box sitting on the desk. At the recommended usage distance (about 24 inch from the face), it's in fact very bright. It also has a very effective lens that can diffuse the light evenly and there is almost no hot spot in terms of light. (But in terms of temperature, the lamp does run quite hot. I cannot keep my hand touching the top of the lamp for more than a few seconds.)The manual has clear instruction that you should not stare at the lamp. Instead, you should place it in the peripheral vision. For me, it is still too bright and my eyes don't like it (perhaps I will like it more in the winter?). Instead, at the moment I have it light up the wall behind my monitor and I think it still works fantastic since it helps to reduce the contrast between the screen and the wall behind it.Inside the box lamp is a 26W CFL in the spiral form. It's changeable and the electric connection is called GU24, which is not Verilux-specific. (As of this writing I know Home Depot has GU24 bulbs and they are even rated at 5K color temperature, but they are lower wattage and are dimmer.) In any case, you can order replacement from Verilux directly. The manual has an order form, and it is 14.95 for each bulb and 6.95 for the shipping.Overall, I have to say I like this lamp for that it does to me, but I also understand that the effect of light therapy can be very different on different bodies. Fortunately, the price is not that steep and if you have a medical need for light therapy I can definitely recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BQ2ZKTUIVN7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K08ZDBI#wasThisHelpful","R3BQ2ZKTUIVN7T","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a ""D-Link Systems Wi-Fi AC750 Portable Router and Charger (DIR-510L)"" for review. What an interesting device! At the size of about an iPhone5  (though longer and thicker), this device packs a feature-rich wireless router AND a 4000mAh rechargeable battery. Very neat.Inside the box you will find the device itself, a brief manual, and a 100-240V wall-to-micro-USB 2A charger. The charger unfortunately is not the sideway type and therefore it can take up multiple wall sockets.The device is full of ports and controls on its four sides. At the south side there is a micro-USB socket for charging the device itself and an Ethernet socket. On the east side there are two USB (apparently USB2.0 according to my testing) ports, rated at 0.5A and 1A. On the north side sits the WPS button and a three-way slide switch (charger, off, on). Finally, on the west side we have a pin-sized factory reset button just in case you have misconfigured the device.The charger function needs no explanation. It works, but 4000mAh is not exactly a lot by today's standard. At best I can say it serves its purpose. However, the wireless router feature of this device is very interesting. There are three modes this router can operate in, depending on its uplink.1. Ethernet. Nothing special: you are sharing the ethernet connection to wireless devices associated with this router. Any wireless router does this.2. USB. This is fun. D-Link's firmware supports a number of USB 3G/4G/LTE modems. That means you can split that 3G/4G/LTE uplink among your devices. A few years ago a device like this can cost several hundred bucks. I don't have a USB modem, and therefore I cannot test this. D-Link says ""For a list of compatible 3G/4G USB adapters, check your local D-Link website."" But I cannot find that list.3. 802.11 hotspot. This is why I am in love with this device. Essentially it acts as a wireless client to another wireless network, and thus allowing you to split the wireless uplink to your other wireless devices. My team travels a lot and truth be told we often need to work in the same hotel room. This is where this device shines: we pay for one hotel room internet access, and the entire team is online! I can see that this device will pay for itself in just a few trips!The device's firmware also features a DLNA server that allows you to share any file stored in a USB thumb drive or even a low-power harddrive (we use the 1A port---it works). This can be super convenient so long as you have the right software clients. You can upload files through their sharepoint HTTP on port 8181, and we share (download) media from the device using VLC. Everything works flawlessly. (The only thing I can wish is to have a SAMBA server to make things more convenient. :P)Overall, I am very impressed with this device. The packaging is top-notch; the built is great; and it boasts a very rich feature set. What's not to love? 5/5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q45UOG0II7W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGLOQ24#wasThisHelpful","R2Q45UOG0II7W8","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Rubbermaid Shaker Bottle, 20-Ounce, Black” for review. In summary it's a BPA-free hard plastic (Tritan) bottle with a five-sided paddle ball for mixing. As you can see from the picture, it has both black and lime green accent, though the tritan plastic is dark grey and so I think black is an apt description.Prior to this I have never used a shaker bottle before. It's principle is really simple: you put the paddle ball into the bottle together with whatever you want to mix, and as you shake the paddle ball will stir the mixture for you to speed up mixing. In practice, my primary application is protein shakes, and I can assure you that it really is a lot faster than just shaking alone. As a result, this has become part of my gym packing routine.The bottle has several nice features. First, there is a rubble handle that makes it easy to clip onto a carabiner. Second, the cover has rubberized side and so twisting it off is easy. Third, the (small) cap on the cover twists in very tightly and this prevents leak from shaking. Furthermore, you cannot lose the cap since it is attached to the cover over a pivot. Finally, the entire bottle is dishwasher safe.Overall, I really think this bottle is very practical for everyday use. I am giving this a five star based on this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNBVBB9E83DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2QLCKK#wasThisHelpful","R3RNBVBB9E83DX","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Tweezerman G.E.A.R. Essential Grooming Kit” for review. Inside the neat small package is a pouch, a nail file, a nail clipper, a pointed tweezer, and a pair of facial hair scissors.My overall impression of this kit is that everything is above average, but all can use some improvements.The pouch, as many reviewers have noted, is large enough but have too much opening when closed. In practice, the nail clipper can easily fall out of the opening in travel.The nail file is quite good but in the one month of testing, I already feel that the file is has reduced efficiency. No, that's not because my mails are that strong. Instead, it has to do with the pattern: when the nail pieces start accumulating in the grooves, you are effectively “un-sharpening” the file. The pattern Tweezerman used happens to make accumulation easier than the other files I have used. (However, it is still very effective, so long as you remember to clean the file regularly.)The clipper is typical Tweezerman quality, which is good. The problem is it's not competitive: no file built-in, and no nail catcher. These are standard these days. (If you can, get a nail clipper by the Japanese brand Muji. It's the standard I judge every nail clipper that comes my way.)The tweezer is the pointed variant, so you should be careful about the point when handling. Fortunately the pouch has a special slot for it so that the point can be properly stored. The points on my pair match up perfectly. Kudos.The pair of scissors is actually a re-branded Inox. It's as good as any other pair of Inox scissors I have come across. Be careful not to use it to cut anything hard. I ruined a pair before by trying to cut a small fragment of nail away. (The metal on the Inox is softer, I don't know why.)Overall, I would say this is a nice starter kit. But I cannot give this a perfect score. So 4/5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387UW79IZGXYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8H6FUG#wasThisHelpful","R387UW79IZGXYY","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Miele RX1 Scout” for review. Previously, I have been called a “Roomba-holdout” in the office: I work in the high-tech industry and I am the only person in the team who doesn't have a robotic vacuum yet. Instead, I happily take out my Dyson and more recently my LG Kompressor every weekend and enjoy the experience of pushing it around by myself. I know this sounds strange, but I really enjoy doing vacuum cleaning and that's one of the few household work items that my gf approves me to do without her supervision. :PI won't go into detail about what this Scout is. Amazon's website and many other reviewers do a wonderful job explaining what it is. Instead, I want to talk about my experience of using it.The out-of-the-box experience is very good. Everything is neatly packaged. The manual is clear: attach the brushes, let it charge first, and setup the remote and clock. Done. The only potential negative here is the gf's comment that this is made in Korea (Miele is a German brand). I honestly have no problem with where this is made so long as it is high-quality.Once done with charging, you essentially push the Auto button to select the mode and then the Play button to go. At this moment the “fun” begins. We have a cat that would chase after anything with the slightest movement. Naturally, the Scout moves, and so she gives chase. Unfortunately this interferes with the Scout because it is a machine and it doesn't understand that the cat is not a piece of furniture. So, we ended up locking the cat in the bedroom for the Scout to finish the living room. First problem.Then we get to the reason why I have been a holdout: these machines are, urr, machines and you really have to work with it and cope with its limits. I claim that I still do a fair bit of work to let the Scout work its way. I have to clean up all the obstacles on the floor or else it may get stuck or keep pushing things around. The cat toy that looks like a tiny pillow? No way, the Scout will try to run over it or keep pushing it around. In practice this generates the same amount of work for me in terms of moving things around. It's just that instead of me doing it one piece at a time, I have to do it all at once before I start the Scout. Second problem.The Scout is supposed to have a good vision algorithm that trumps all Roomba: instead of literally bumping into a furniture and uses the physical feedback (at which point your chair's leg can already been scratched), it uses a camera to try to not run into anything. However, just as some other reviewers have pointed out, the machine vision algorithm in the Scout can really use some improvement: in my case not only it cannot see the cat toys, it also could not see the cloth window shade and would run into the glass window behind it. Miele did provide us with a short magnetic strip that can act as a barrier, but it is too short for the entire sliding window in the living room. We decided that it's ok for it to bump into the glass anyway and let it go. Then the Scout decided to not touch the strip of carpet in front of the AV system. Maybe that was due to the magnetic field of the AV? Third problem. (In any case, I guess maybe later firmware updates will improve the performance.)The dust bin is generous but understandably doesn't compare with any old-school vacuum. I realize that Scout owners probably would let it run everyday and so it is not a real problem. However, if that means  I have to arrange the room everyday (think the cat toys), then no thank you. In our case we manage to fill the bin after an hour. (The battery is supposed to be able to last for two hours, btw.) It's not a big deal, but just remember that this is not a real “week-ender”. Fourth problem (for me anyway).Overall, I would say that if you are looking for a robotic vacuum and can cope with its limit, this Miele may be worth checking out given its extensive feature set (the remote control mode is super fun for the cat). In fact, my gf commented that she would definitely go with the Miele since she has discussed this extensively with her friends who own Roombas and every one of her friends thinks the Miele is more desirable. The reason I said “may” is because at the time of this writing there is no asking price yet and so it is difficult for me to comment on how I see its value.To end this review, while I appreciate this Miele a lot, logically I will continue to be a Roomba-holdout for the longest time to come. :) I justify my four-star rating due to two competing factors: this is premium design, but it is not without its flaw in the machine vision department. Given the potentially high asking price and the uncertainty of future firmware upgrades, giving this a 5/5 would be difficult. I hope Miele would appreciate my honest feedback. Sorry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SFFEF1V7JJ2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT389OY#wasThisHelpful","R3SFFEF1V7JJ2V","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Kensington Proximo Key FOB Bluetooth Tracker for iPhone 5S/5C/5/4S and Samsung Galaxy S3/S4” for review. On paper this is a great concept: a key fob that keeps a bluetooth connection to your phone and a corresponding app on the phone. Once the bluetooth connection drops or degrades to a certain level, you get alerted. The app also has a feature to allow you to page the fob, and vice versa. So, what's not to love?Unfortunately, as many reviewers have indicated, there are two everyday issues that keep me from warming up to this Kensington key fob. First, the “panic button” on the fob is too prone to be pressed. That means in practice your phone panics all the time. On the first day of trying, I think I triggered it at least five times. It's that embarrassing... you sit down, the pocket presses the keys onto the fob, and alarm it goes. Second, the app has trouble staying alive on the phone, which means you can find the fob using the app (since you are using the app and so it is alive), but you can rarely find the phone using the fob (since you are not using the app, which can get suspended by the phone's O/S). Fortunately, haha, in the modern times I tend to lose my keys more often than my phone, and so this is not too big of a problem. However, if it's the other way around for you, I would not recommend this.Overall, I think this is a reasonably-good concept but with a lackluster execution. The price is not low either. Sorry, Kensington, I can only give this three stars at best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GLCCIE5XCOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQQ4PNQ#wasThisHelpful","R17GLCCIE5XCOC","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a “Fugoo Tough Bluetooth Wireless Speaker” for review. In the past I have encountered a number of bluetoth wireless speakers, including a Bose SoundLink Mini, a Jam Party HMDX, and a Pure Jongo S3. Instead of purely focusing on describing the features of this Fugoo, I will try to draw a comparison.First, here is what the Fugoo is. The model I reviewed is the Tough edition, meaning that it comes in a sturdy metal/rubber casing that Fugoo says is virtually indestructible. The casing is sturdy but also makes the speaker heavy. The spec claims to be snowproof, sandproof, and also waterproof at 3 feet for up to 30 minutes. I did try to use the speaker during a shower with water pouring on top. It works. This is the first Bluetooth speaker I have taken a bath with. Ha.The control is extremely simple.  On the top there are two volume buttons and a “shift button”. If you shift+volume, you skip tracks. The shift button also acts a clicker for play and pause.On one side is the power button and the bluetooth pairing button. It seems it can only pair with one device. This is common among speakers I have tried except for the Bose where you can pair with 6 devices. One feature (annoying or not is up to you) is that the speaker can announce its status---at startup it says “Powering On, Device Connected”, and at a press of the power button after it started it will announce the power level like “battery is about half full”. It will also say “Powering off”  at power off. I have yet to figure out how turn the first and last announcements off.On the other side is a min usb slot for charging (no, it does not appear to be an USB speaker), and an audio jack for connected playback.The audio playback quality is very good, thanks to its 6(!)-speaker design. It's hard to see through the Tough casing, but they are there if you shine light through the mesh. I am thrilled at the sound quality. It is every bit as good as the Bose and the Pure, both of which blows the Jam Party away. However, as I have indicated in my review on the Jam Party, for an outdoor speaker the audio quality does not matter too much. (This is the reason why I think the Jam Party is a reasonable buy for outdoor picnics, though it is definitely not waterproof.)Unfortunately, thus Fugoo seems to have a battery drain similar to the Bose. Perhaps these speakers don't really turn off completely. I discovered this by turning it off (the speaker announces “Powering off”, so there can be no ambiguity on what I should expect) and leave it for a week. When I come back, there is no power left. The Jam Party and the Pure do not have this problem.One key thing that distinguishes this Fugoo bluetooth speaker from the rest of the pack is that it is in fact NOT just a speaker. I don't know why the marketing material says it's a speaker when it's really a speakphone! Indeed, it has a fully working microphone built-in. You can hold a conversation with it and I have tested it on Skype. It works flawlessly and the audio quality is as good as any other microphone I have tried if I am close enough. (In this use case the quality bottleneck is usually the audio compression deployed by Skype.) However, perhaps due to the sturdy casing, the audio quality drops once I am at about 3 feet away. For this reason I would not use it on my desk to hold teleconference. And just like any other microphone I have tried, it's mono and using it will also forces OS X to change the playback to the mono as well. (If you select stereo playback, it disconnects the microphone.)Inside the box, which is extremely difficult to open, is the speaker itself, a 2.1A USB charger (allowing charging to be fast), a usb cable, and an 3.5mm audio cable. The cables are tangle-resistant and very high quality. Great stuff. There is no manual other than a very simple leaflet. Interesting there is no hex key included to allow me to remove the casing. (I imagine if I buy another casing it will come with it?)Overall, I am very impressed with both the build and the audio quality of this Fugoo. For anyone who has an active lifestyle that involves sand and water, I would highly recommend it. The asking price is a little bit high, but then, you are really getting top-quality components. (I am only aware of one other water-proof bluetooth speaker. But I have not tried it so I cannot draw a comparison.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP9PXHUNWKGWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBJ3OBO#wasThisHelpful","RP9PXHUNWKGWN","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Rayovac PS73-4BT6 7-Hour Power Back Up for iPhones, Android, and Micro-USB Mobile Phones for review. Inside the box is the charger, a USB-to-microUSB cable, a USB-to-iPhone (old 30-pin standard, not lightning) cable, and four AA non-rechargable batteries. I don't have an iDevice so I have used the USB-to-microUSB cable only.The charger is very simple: it essentially is a battery case where you can put four AA batteries in serial (that's about 6V), and then it down-regulates the voltage to USB (5V). There is no on/off switch. You plug a USB cable into the charger's USB socket and it turns on; unplug and it turns off. There are two problems with the operation if I have to nitpick. 1. The charger turns on even if you have not connected a device on the other side. 2. When it turns on, there are three green LED on the charger to tell you how much juice your AA batteries have, and they are super bright Combining 1 and 2 means that you can potentially drain your AA batteries unintentionally.In actual usage, the amount of power it carries depends on your AA batteries. I have previously purchased an Energizer 3AA-to-USB charger B0093GIME8, and since that is a 3AA design, the running time is lower than this 4AA design. However, this also means the Energizer is more compact. A very reasonable tradeoff.The charger's construction feels a bit, urr, low-quality and the battery cover wobbles a bit more than I wish. I have not seen this grade of plastic in electronics for a long time. To give you a rough idea, I think all the TV remote controls I have handled in the last 10 years have a higher quality plastic than this. However, let me stress that this is enough to get the job done.Overall, if you are looking for a good 4AA-to-USB charger, this is a solid choice in terms of its one-and-only one feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6W0Y3DWF8FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2ZQ6ZI#wasThisHelpful","R3O6W0Y3DWF8FI","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have not actually drop it from that height onto a hard surfaced, but repeated droppings onto carpet from standing height (about 4-5 feet) do seem to do no damage to the flashlight at all. In other words, if you are a domestic user, I think this is really almost indestructible in the house. The flash light is water-resistant but not water-proof, so don't go diving/snorkeling with it. :) Overall, this is a very solid (pun intended) offering from Rayovac.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine Program, I have received a white AKG K323 XS In-Ear Headphones with In-Line remote control and microphone for review. My overall impression of this AKG is that it is a solid offering for what it *is*, but the asking price is a tad high for my taste.Spec: At 12.85 gram (0.45 oz), this is a very light IEH (in-ear headphone; a perhaps more common name for this is IEM where M stands for “monitor”, except I am very sure no one agrees that this AKG is monitor-grade worthy). The spec claims to support 20Hz-20kHz, but of course this is essentially saying “typical human hearing range”.Components: In the plastic case there is the headphone itself, and it comes with four sets of tips (XS, S, M, L) and a small cloth pouch. I use the XS because my ears are small and you need get a good sealing for this AKG to sound right. There are also some paper documents in the package, but they are not the manual; instead they state the warranty (one year), the typical warning (don't listen too loudly), and the environmental/recycle information. The operating instruction is printed on the packaging, and it pictorially says press the middle button on the inline control to start/ stop music or take/ hangup calls. If your software supports it, you can also press the button twice to go to the next track (most Android music players support this). And if your software also supports it, you can press the button three times in a quick succession to go to the previous track. I have yet to encounter a music player that supports this but I have heard of such. (Yes, it's much less elegant than the method on Apple iDevices, but I heard there is a patent issue for other platforms to implement it...)Sound: This AKG sounds ok on day 1, but if you are willing to give it two weeks (about 14-20 hours) for “break-in”, then it does sound smoother. Another thing that new IEH users need to get accustomed to: if you don't obtain a tight seal, the sound is bad; but if you do, not only do you get to suppress the environmental sound well, you also get base. At the fifty buck price point, I have not heard any IEH that can be considered to be much better. So you do get what you pay for, if you want the benefit of in-ear, i.e., lower environmental noise.Usability: However, you do not necessarily want in-ears, especially if you are on the move (walking between home and office in my example). There are two reasons. First is unfixable and is a definite cons for almost all IEH/IEMs I have tried: microphonics, meaning the ability for the cable to transmit noise to your ear as it rubs over your clothes. This AKG is downright horrible in this department. I can hear every rub. Second is fixable: it really needs a clip to clip the cable to the shirt. Amazingly AKG decided not to give us a clip. Fortunately, there are a lot of aftermarket offerings and my dollar-store solution worked well. And if you clip the cable, the microphonics reduces too. AKG should really ship a clip in the future.Phone calls: The microphone on the inline control picks up the sound very well, just like every other phone-grade microphone I have used. No complaint here.Durability: Unfortunately the jack is damaged in 2 weeks. I have uploaded a photo showing you the problem. This is fixed using super-glue.Overall: If I can I will give 4.5 stars due to the small flaws. But I am rounding up since the flaws are either fixable (clip) or applicable to all similar in-ear designs (microphonics).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODG55S4L3U4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E89ASPQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ODG55S4L3U4P","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a T-fal FV4495 Ultraglide Easycord Steam Iron with Ceramic Scratch Resistant Nonstick Soleplate for review. It is rated at 1725 watt, which is in the same ball park as most domestic full-size irons I have tried.I will give you the bottomline first. I am not sure if I have received a faulty unit, or if the design is problematic, but my copy drips quite a bit. I am taking a star off due to this.T-fal can make very good iron. My first iron right before college graduation (needed one for interview clothes) was T-fal and the smooth ceramic plate was what won me over. I am happy to report that this T-fal FV4495 also sports a smooth ceramic plate, and it feels every bit as smooth as any good iron I have used, including top-of-the-line Rowentas and Electroluxs. (I bought a Rowenta DW9080 two years ago. See my review there.)I don't have the number of steam holes. Some other brands like Rowenta like to advertise that they have 400 holes. However, in use, this feels every bit as powerful as my Rowenta in its steam generation capability.The water tank on this T-fal is big. It easily lets me iron an entire week of office clothes. No complaint here either. It uses tap water and has a decent de-calc system. (I never needed to de-calc more than once a year since I live in a soft-water city.)The cord is sufficiently long, at around 12 feet. It's quite typical in a full-sized iron. The iron also heats up respectful quick. There is a safety timer that turns off the iron after about 10 minutes. So all is well in the electricity department.The one thing that makes me take two stars off is that my copy drips way more than the other irons I have tried. I am not sure if it is my technique or a faulty heating system, but I can often see a few drops of water on my shirt before the iron reaches the shirt. In practice, this is not as big a problem as it sounds since you are going to heat the shirt through ironing, thus taking care of the water. However, since the other irons I have tried do not have this problem, I consider this a relative cons and thus take a star off.For its asking price this is a very good iron. I would easily give it five stars if it were not for the dripping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3LKYJTPSZCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG84YQU#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3LKYJTPSZCQ","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a 1-qt Oster Mykonos Greek Yogurt Maker for review. Note that there is also a 2-qt version, which addresses my most major complaint to this 1-qt version, namely that it's too small if you are really making greek-style yogurt.I have owned a yogurt maker for many years and a yogurt maker is really just a slightly-heated container. The idea is you first pasteurize the milk, increase the protein content if you want (by adding powdered milk), and then cool it to a suitable temperature and add the starter. Put the mixture into the maker and wait a number of hours (think 8, but it varies) and the heated compartment will keep the bacteria active throughout. The bacteria will digest the lactose, give out acid, which in turn makes the protein curd.This Oster yogurt maker is no different from any other yogurt maker I have tried. Every step up to the waiting part is done manually in your kitchen. The only difference is that this comes with a tons of accessories. First, there are four cute 7oz glass jars with plastic lids. Then it has a 17oz larger plastic container that allows you to make a medium sized batch (obviously 4 * 7 = 28 so you have more capacity if you use the jars instead of this plastic container). Then it comes with a strainer, which is what makes this a greek yogurt maker. (Greek yogurt is essentially strained yogurt).Overall, I have no complaints about the yogurt maker itself. It keeps the temperature well throughout the night. The plastic used in this maker does not have any bad smell (I had one that smells really “plastiky”.) The glass jars are nice, and the recipe book is informative. For these, I will give it five starts.However, I must take a star off if this is supposed to be a greek yogurt maker. The reason is because its designed capacity is just too small. Recall that greek yogurt is strained. For every ounce of “normal” yogurt you make, you get about half an ounce of greek yogurt. So all your effort to pasteurize the milk gives you at most 14oz of greek yogurt at the end. What for?I highly recommend getting at least the 2qt version if you are serious about making yogurt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ORUH54U5K07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GY3OZXA#wasThisHelpful","R21ORUH54U5K07","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Savora Garlic Press for review. Mine came in red. It comes in a very elegant gift box.This garlic press can be decomposed into three parts. The colored part you see in the product photos is plastic, and hence it can come in many colors. The silver handle is inseparable from the plastic part, and it is heavy metal. The silver grille at the bottom of the photos is metal also, and it can be twisted off for cleaning. The transparent cap on the grille is plastic, and it snaps on the grille very tightly and doubles as a container when pressing.The mechanism is a bit hard to describe and I refer you to the product photos for clarification. Essentially you open the metal handle to expose the chamber behind the grille for you to put some garlic pieces in. Then you close the metal handle towards the plastic handle, which will drive a metal plate towards the grille, thus crushing the garlic pieces through the grille into the container cap. Since the grille can be twisted off, cleaning is easy. It is dish-washer safe too, just in case.The design is such that you have a 6-to-1 mechanical advantage. In my very elementary understanding of mechanics, I think of it as the distance travelled by the handle is 6 times larger than the distance travelled by the press. Hence the power from you is “condensed” 6 times, which makes crushing garlic feels easy. (That's essentially what you get from a lever, except that here it is driven by gear.) In practice, it does feel that way. I have never used a garlic press that feels easier.Another ergonomic advantage is that you do not need to hold the press in the air. Instead, you can rest it on the table top with the container cap. This allows the press to be made with heavy metal parts. (And it is indeed quite heavy.)In terms of design this is easily a 10 out of 10. So what's not to like?The construction. See I keep saying “crush” everywhere in this review? The problem is that the press has too much tolerance and the metal plate never quite touch the grille on my copy. This ends up being a big problem in practice: try as I might, this is at best a “garlic masher/ricer” or “garlic crusher” in my kitchen. There is a lot of garlic left between the metal plate and the grille, which spells waste. My other garlic press (from an O brand) has almost zero tolerance and the two pieces of metal meet very tightly. Therefore, every bit of garlic is at least in the grille. There is always some left in the grille in both designs, but that is understandable.It does not help to have the container cap snap so tightly to the grille either. I expect the cap may become looser over use. But the problem is that I will not be using it long enough to find out.I am giving this a 3/5. It has a very good design (5/5), but a poor implementation takes at least two stars off. Sorry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WF392F3VOQVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AV9GTFA#wasThisHelpful","R1WF392F3VOQVI","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received an Actiontec 200Mbps Powerline Network Adaptor Kit for review. This essentially is a pair of adaptors that plug into two electric sockets at your home and use the power line between the socket to run network traffic. Then you plug your network devices to the adaptors using the two included ethernet cables (yes, cables are included).My router is on the ground floor and so that's where one of the adaptors go. I have tried a couple of different locations in the house measure the throughput. My home was built in 1960 and so the wires are quite old. The best speed I get, which is from the very same socket, is 80Mbps. This is not bad for an adaptor that is rated at 200Mbps. However, on pretty much any other socket in my home, I get about 30Mbps max. Again, I must stress that these speeds are for my house only. Your experience may be different.Since the whole point of these adaptors are to get a connection that is faster than wireless and yet I already can do better than 30Mbps on wireless, I am a bit disappointed. (Yes, in real life, I would have returned it.) However, since the adaptors work as promised, and they are very easy to set up, I feel that I should still give them a 5/5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDU87SOAAU39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF8ZRPU#wasThisHelpful","R2BDU87SOAAU39","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a  24"" Aquatic Life LED Aquarium Light Fixture for review.In essence, this is a thin (quarter-inch) LED light with a variety of LED and a programmable 3-channel timer. There are 13 6K White LEDs, 14 9K White LEDs, 17 10K White LEDs, 3 Blue LEDs, 7 Red LEDs, and finally 3 Blue ""Lunar"" LEDs. At maximum output (all LEDs on), this consumes 36W as rated on the power brick (wall-adapter).The 3-channel timer allows you set the on and off time of two day channels and one night channel. Using this, you can create a variety of lighting conditions. The day channels controls the white, red, and blue LEDs. The night channel controls the three lunar blue LED. For me, I had both the day channels start at 7am and off at 10pm, by then it switches to the night channel.Operational-wise, programming the timer is super easy. I was able to follow the instructions in the manual and get it up and running in under 5 minutes.The LEDs run rather hot, which explains why the top of the light is in fact a heat-sink. Since it is winter right now, I do not have any problem. I will come back and update the review if there is any issue during the summer.My review unit did not come with a manual, and it took a little while for me to realize that I have not been mounting this light correctly. The two L clamps on the side are in fact adjustable by loosening and tightening four screws. By sliding the rails, this lighting can fit aquariums that are from 23.5 inch to 26.25 inch. Now it fits snuggly on my 24 inch tank, and all looks good.(I came back to update my review after using it for a month. So far it has been running trouble-free.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1963EX290OFJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3Y4YF8#wasThisHelpful","R1963EX290OFJY","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Belkin QODE Ultimate Keyboard Case for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. As typical for reviews like this, I am typing this review on this keyboard.Construction-wise, the metal frame seems sturdy, but the keys are more wobbly that I would like. It is a very compact keyboard case. Once you put the Galaxy into the sleeve, it does feel integrated into one piece. All the ports remain accessible, and the rubber is nonslip. I would give this a 8/10 in terms of construction.Electronically, this keyboard is a bluetooth keyboard. I was able to pair it with a variety of devices without any hassle. Well-done, Belkin.The power on-off mechanism is very clever. Essentially, there are magnets built into the lower rim of the sleeve that is intended to hold the tablet. Once you open the tablet (like as you open the lid of a laptop) and let the magnets engage with the magnets built into the keyboard, the keyboard turns on. There are also multiple magnets on the keyboard and so you can pick your angle. Very clever.So what's not to like? Unfortunately the keyboard layout drives me crazy. At 10.1 inch there will be compromises if the keys are to remain large. However, if you are a touch typist on a computer, then you will be constantly pressing the wrong key when you type punctuations. Look at the , . / ? < > : ; ~ ' “ keys on the product pictures. I am especially annoyed that they move the semicolon.Overall, I'd say that if you want a keyboard for your Galaxy Tab, this is a very good choice. However, be very aware that you may have trouble touch typing. This is especially concerning given the relative high asking price. I am taking a star off due to the layout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NY6J3FLIVVCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F69PXL6#wasThisHelpful","R2NY6J3FLIVVCY","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design of this stopper is very elegant: by tightening the screw, you push together two pieces of metal sandwiching a rubber stopper. As the metal pieces get closer, the rubber gets squeezed along the vertical axis and thus expands (bulges) horizontally, thus sealing the bottle opening. I picked this stopper since this design allows it to fit more bottles.The external polished stainless steel surface screams high-class and the stopper is very hefty. I would have totally loved it...Unfortunately, they cheap out on the screw and the thread on mine has stripped after the third use. Now it becomes a very elegant paper-weight.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a LeapFrog LeapPad2 Kids' Learning Tablet (Custom Edition) for review. Let me first explain what Custom Edition means. This is essentially a LeapPad2 with 10 extra sticker skins and matching pictures on the LeapPad itself.It is tempting to compare this with an iPad mini (7 inch) or any one of the many 5-inch Android tablets. For about seventy dollars you get a 4-AA tablet that has a 5 inch touch screen with 4GB of memory, and you even get front and back cameras, though the cameras are only of average quality. There is no wifi though, and so the cameras are really for recording only. You get extensions through buying more LeapPad games.As many reviewers have pointed out, the LeapPad games are a bit expensive though, and that is in comparison with iPad and Android apps. This complicates the equation, unfortunately. With LeapPad, you may pay less up front; but if you ever need to get more games, you can potentially make it into the iPad mini territory, and at that point you will notice that an iPad mini can do so much more than a LeapPad. Worse, some of the 5-inch Android tablets are not even that expensive---they are in the same range as the LeapPad itself. I think this is the point that what every reviewer must make.However, I would actually argue that LeapPad still makes a lot of sense. First, not having a wifi network is a plus to me. You do not need to worry about what can be done on it. Second, from what I understand, many of the LeapPad titles are LeapPad-exclusive and that alone makes the LeapPad worth considering. LeapPad has been in the market since 1999, and a lot of professional games have already been developed for it. Third, teach them as I may, kids sometimes throw things. In this department the LeapPad wins hands down compared to an iPad mini since it is much more affordable to replace. Unfortunately I have seen Android tablets that have similar weight to a LeapPad and so this argument is weak in that aspect.Overall, I think LeapPad still makes a lot of sense even in the current market. For its intended audience (3-9 years old), I think the availability of high-quality educational games cannot be overlooked. I give this a solid 5/5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IHBJX2JG4T2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTCKNYQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IHBJX2JG4T2S","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Rowenta DW9081 Steamium Steam Iron for review. I bought a DW9080 two years ago, and I guess that's why Amazon thinks I should review the DW9081. I use my DW9080 every weekend for the dress shirts and pants for work, and so I have very good experience with it. This past month, I have swapped in the DW9081. My focus is on whether there is any improvement in the DW9081 over the DW9080.I will give you the bottomline first: I cannot find any improvement, and at the current price that a DW9080 is selling for, I would totally recommend going with that model instead. (Of course, when you read this the DW9080 stock may have already been depleted.)I am a male office worker and not a sewer, and so my metric for an iron is how much time it takes me to get good results on my work clothes. I avoid starch as much as I can, and as a result I don't really dirt my soleplate much other than lint. I also only use the cotton setting exclusively even though the iron can do the entire range of temperature from nylon all the way up to linen.With that said, I am quite happy with the DW9081 (everything I said here applies to the DW9080). Before I switched to Rowenta I was using a T-Fal that has about 100 holes. The 400-hole feature is basically a gimmick. Honestly if they change it to 100-hole, I would not notice. You need to understand: a 4 times increase in the number of holes is just a 2 times in increase in density. And 100 holes are already aplenty for the steam to hit the shirt evenly, and 400 holes are just great (or an overkill, depending on your perspective).The soleplate is very smooth, and it has a nice tip that makes precision ironing possible.  I especially like the steam trigger on the index finger and that, I believe, is the most distinctive reason why you want a DW9081 over any other iron that does not have this trigger feature. The idea is you first use steam with the trigger to iron the fabric and create a crease, then you release the trigger and dry-iron the crease alone to lock it in. It works wonder once you master this technique.The iron heats up fast, and the water tank is large enough for me to go through all five sets of clothes each weekend. The anti-drip works ok, and I have yet to experience any dripping on my old DW9080, and thus I expect the same on the DW9081. I must mention that while this Rowenta takes tap water (no need to get distillated water), you should definitely empty the water tank after each use. At one point I was lazy and didn't do this, and rust water came out and ruined a shirt~~~ my bad. Fortunately, after using the self-cleaning feature a few times in a row, there is no more rust in my DW9080. And now that I am on the DW9081, I will take extra care to make sure rust does not develop on this one.Overall, I'd say that there is nothing to complain on the DW9081. If you are in the market for a good quality iron, you just cannot go wrong. Price is a bit on the high side (and thus my comment on the DW9080), but I tend to think that you do get what you paid for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q92VMTKGS8OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEBPG3G#wasThisHelpful","R1Q92VMTKGS8OQ","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a uComfy Shiatsu Foot Massager for review. I am familiar with electric massagers for the back and neck, but this is the first time I try an electric foot massager. Essentially it provides two foot pockets that are surrounded by machine inflatable air pressure bags on the top and several sets of motorized, rotating “teeth” at the bottom. The machine periodically inflates and deflates the air pressure bags and change the direction of each set of teeth. This is how it massages your feet.The uComfy is a relatively big machine at about 14 inch long, 16 inch wide, and 9 inch tall. It comes with an external power supply like the ones you get from laptops. The two foot pockets are zip-detachable and can be washed for hygiene. There are five buttons on the top surface. From farthest to closest they are heat, vibration down, vibration up, kneading, and power. Right below the power button is a two digit LCD countdown counter (like the digits you see on calculators).The power button is easy to figure out. Once pressed, the machine turns on for 15 minutes with the counter showing the remaining minutes until the last minute at which point it shows the remaining seconds. The heat button toggles a rather mild heat generator. If the heat is on, yellow lamps inside the machine will turn on. I am not sure if there is a separate heat generator, or if the lamp is the heat source. In any case, since it is mid-winter as I am reviewing this, this feature is very welcomed and I can actually detect the difference it makes.The “vibration” buttons do not seem to control vibration. In fact, the machine hardly has any vibration at all. Instead, they control the air pressure, which defaults to level 3 at startup, and can be adjusted between 1 and 5. The machine does not have memory and you have to set the air pressure level every time if you do not like the default level.The kneading button is the almost mysterious. After a lot of experiments, I think there is a set of special “teeth” in the machine that are activated only when the kneading feature is on. (It is on by default.) This is most obvious if you set the air pressure level to 1.Overall, I find this foot massager to be quite comfortable and easy to use. I have been using it every night after bath. It does a reasonable job in hitting every spot on your footbed. I happen to have plantar fasciitis on my right foot, and on some nights it was actually a bit painful, but in a good way. So far it has not helped my situation though.Will I recommend it? Yes. It works as advertised so long as you know what the buttons are for. However, at the moment the asking price is quite high for what this machine does. Honestly, if it breaks down, I would not replace it at this level. I am still going to give it a 5/5 though. (I am tempted to take a star off due to the poor instructions, but really even at its default settings the machine is good enough to be recommendable.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JXR1A88PUA7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSICT1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1JXR1A88PUA7U","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Freshware 12-cup silicone muffin pan for review. As a silicone pan, this one is on the thin side: I cannot imagine moving this into a preheated oven when it is loaded with batter. To be sure, I have not seen any such silicone pan for muffins due the large amount of batter involved. However, I can still tell by feel alone that it is thinner than some of my other silicone pans, such as those from the W brand.The manufacturer lists “Heat Tunnel” as a patented design. Honestly, I am not so sure what this feature is since the manual that comes with the pan does not mention this. The only special thing I find is that this pan has a very slight dotted pattern on the bottom surface. Presumably the tunnels around the dots can allow hot air to circulate better. This is especially important for this muffin pan since, again, you need to support it below with a cookie sheet or a jellyroll pan.Of course, the most important metric of a baking pan is the quality of the baked goods. In this regard, this pan delivers: the muffins brown well, and the release is very easy. Unfortunately, even though it has the Heated Tunnel design, it does not seem to outperform my existing W silicone muffin pan. The muffins from either pan are very similar. Also, so far I have yet to find silicone pans better than my existing metal pans from W-S, and this one is also consistent with my experience: metal pans brown baked goods better, and is also very easy to release if used properly.Overall, I am still giving this a 5/5 since it has nothing to fault on as a silicone muffin pan.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Levana Oma+ Clip-On Portable Baby Movement Monitor for review. First of all, I think this should be clear: not every newborn needs to be monitored this intensively, but it certainly doesn't seem to hurt to do so. But if you know you need one for your baby, then be assured that this is a superb design.As a movement monitor, this device clips onto a diaper and senses breathing by proxy of abdominal movement. If there is no movement in 15 seconds, it vibrates a bit to nudge the baby to cause some movement in response. And if there is no movement in 20 seconds, it sounds an alarm. The alarm is loud enough to be heard in the next room, but I would not count on it on a different floor.The design is well thought out. It's wireless, so there is no cable to worry about tangling. The clip is secure.

"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Corsair Vengeance 2100 Wireless Dolby 7.1 Gaming Headset (V2100) for review. Prior to this, I have been using a Sound Blaster EVO Entertainment Headset with Bluetooth Mobile Wireless (EVO) as my gaming headset. In what follows, I will draw a few contrasts between these two headsets from the perspective of a Mac casual gamer (~1 hours a day).The V2100 is a 2.4GHz wireless circumaural headset with a pair of 50mm drivers. Inside the box is a USB wireless transceiver that must be used in order to use the headset. This is in stark contrast from the EVO, which can be used in USB, bluetooth, and also analog (3.5mm) mode. The selling point of the V2100 over EVO would be that it can do Dolby 7.1 wirelessly. Unfortunately, as Corsair made clear on the packaging and also on their website, Dolby 7.1 works only on Windows (version XP to 8)---there is no Mac driver yet. Therefore, for this review I have only been able to use the headset in stereo mode. It's a bit disappointing in this regard, and I can only hope that Corsair releases a Mac driver one day.Fortunately, the V2100 is already very impressive even as a stereo headset, thanks to its 50mm drivers. In terms of audio quality, the V2100 has a discernible advantage over the EVO, which is 40mm, but the improvement is moderate only (a typical diminish of return phenomenon in headsets past the 100 dollar mark). For gaming, both the EVO and the V2100 are more than adequate. Explosions have enough oomph, and dialogue is clear and separable from background music. But here is the bonus if you get the V2100: I am currently happily enjoying the V2100 as my primary wireless headset for music at home as well. Indeed I have been pleasantly surprised by the good overall sound quality of the V2100, given it is wireless. It gets close enough to my wired headphones in the two-hundred dollar range that I am willing to give up some quality for the sake of being wireless.Speaking of the wireless connection, it's very robust. I live in an apartment complex and there is a lot of wireless interference due to wifi and whatnot. Corsair quoted 40 feet in range, and I can confirm that it does work for me. For gaming applications, this range should be very adequate. Corsair also included an 5-feet USB extension cable in case you use the V2100 on a desktop so that you can improve reception by better antenna placement, and an 5-feet micro-USB cable for charging. (Yes, the headset can be used while charging.)Playback is only half of the story for a gaming headset. The other half is recording. In this area, the V2100 is also very competitive. On the left ear cup is a broom with a unidirectional noise-canceling microphone. In actual gameplay and also Skype, my friends all reported very good recording quality. The broom also has a trick: it has a mechanical mute trigger. Push the broom up (retract towards the headset) and the recording stops; pull it back down and the recording resumes. I cannot overstate how convenient this is.Battery life is quoted at 10 hours, and in my experience it is accurate. With the very first charging I logged at least 8 hours of gameplay. Charging is also very fast. 2-3 hours was all I need on a 2.1 amp charger (the ones we use for iPads; if you use smaller-amp chargers the time will rise).If I really have to pick on the V2100, it would be heat. Being circumaural means each ear cup surrounds the ear completely. Depending on your personal taste, it can get uncomfortably hot---especially when you are already all psyched up due to gameplay. I must stress that, however, this is to be expected. There is no easy fix. Having said that, I should remark that the V2100 is very comfortable in other areas: the ear cups are well cushioned, as is the head band. It's not obvious in the pictures, but the cups can rotate in the vertical axis and therefore you can be sure of getting an even pressure (if it does not rotate, then the pressure to the front and to the back of the ear can be different and this can cause discomfort).Another aspect that I wish Corsair would improve on is the volume control, which is a scroll wheel on the left ear cup. That wheel just lacks precision on Mac---it seems impossible to use the wheel to adjust the volume by one notch (one unit of volume with respect to F11 and F12, the standard Mac volume key).Overall, I am very impressed with the V2100. Yes, I know what some people may think since I have received it for free. But no, it is something that I will replace with my own money if I happen to lose it and I will definitely pick it over the EVO. Plus, the fact that I put in the effort to write a long review (when a shorter one would suffice). I really believe that the price/performance ratio the V2100 is high enough to warrant a 5-star review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14R6WT2FVLKDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXPNFUA#wasThisHelpful","R14R6WT2FVLKDR","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have shoulder pain due to overuse early on in my life, and on some days it is bad enough that I have to take a pain killer. I happened to have other issues that prevent me from taking most of the NSAIDs, and so acetaminophen has been my go-to pill before I see this on the Amazon Vine program (which, for full disclosure, sent me the bottle to review). On average, I need acetaminophen 7 to 10 days a month.I am glad that I learned about this Curcumin Phytosome supplement on Vine. In my actual use, I feel that taking one pill after dinner is an almost sure way to eliminate any pain the next morning. Since I have started the routine a month ago, I have only needed to use acetaminophen twice.So why do I say it's almost as effective as acetaminophen only? Well, it just doesn't last as long because in my experience I have to take it the night before and by late afternoon I can feel my shoulder pain. Unfortunately, if I take the pill at breakfast, it won't kick in until later in the afternoon. This is in contrast with acetaminophen, which takes about 30 minutes so I am all ready when I get to office. This is why I actually take one pill at dinner and one pill at breakfast. (60 pills = 1 bottle = 1 month for me). At present, this seems to be working really well.Upon researching it on the internet, I learned that curcumin phytosome is a form of turmeric that is more readily absorbed by our body (this is called “bioavailability”). In fact there is a patent pending on it, which is why even though the bottle is branded and distributed as Jarrows Formulas, you still see the Meriva label on it. This is critical when you shop around because you know that every vendor who uses Meriva's compound gives you effectively the same thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9O4QCAOAUA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAYNWY0#wasThisHelpful","RC9O4QCAOAUA8","A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a collection of a bunch of uncensored grindhouse trailers from the '70s and early '80s, and they're great. Many forgotten gems, the full versions of which don't exist on DVD anywhere, and the transfers really are quite good. Plenty of nudity on display. Really a lot of fun, as long as you understand what you're getting into ahead of time and can appreciate it for what it is.Host Nikki Leigh (apparently a Playboy Playmate) is present but doesn't take too much screen time or talk so much that it becomes annoying. And of course she spends the entirety in her underwear, which is a plus. It would have been a bigger plus had she taken them off.The only negative that I could see is that some of the trailers already are out there on other collections.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGVAOAX91D9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPS32EG#wasThisHelpful","R3AGVAOAX91D9D","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a classic, and this Blu-ray version looks phenomenal, but just on its own merits it probably would earn three stars. It's a little unevenly paced and slow-starting. Director indicated that he cut out all of the full-frontal nudity and I think that that was a mistake for a movie called ""Frankenhooker.""It does have its moments. The (spoiler alert) exploding hookers, and mutant creatures made out of odds-and-ends body parts, are funny in their absurdity. Patty Mullen is amazing in her role as the female lead, especially considering that she had so little acting experience. And there are a few hot women here who show a little skin.What elevates this to four stars are the aforementioned beautiful transfer, the impressive DVD authoring and the several extras: a few behind-the-scenes featurettes and a director's commentary. (The SFX designer also is on the commentary track, but in name only since director Frank Henenlotter insisted on shouting over him for the duration.)If you're a fan of these old B movies from the late '80s and early '90s, you really can't go wrong with buying this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETMKLR06AAJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005K08J8U#wasThisHelpful","RETMKLR06AAJX","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's really hard to know how to rate Bill Zebub's stuff that I've seen, which admittedly hasn't been too much. But this one is really tough.Firstly, this is two full-length features, one ""Science-Less Fiction"" and the other ""Indie Director."" Most of the same cast members are in both.Young fanboys who think that they're edgy will watch ""Science-Less Fiction"" for the absurd level of racist shock value. Zebub tries to act like all of this was very self-aware and tongue-in-cheek, but I'm not so sure--it seems to come with far too much ease. I'm a white guy and definitely no screaming liberal idiot, but a lot of the dialogue was tough for me to stomach. Most of the production values are pretty terrible and overall, the movie doesn't make a lot of sense. Something about racist aliens dressed as clowns invading the Earth?? He's trying to make some political statements here but I had trouble cutting through the insanity to figure out what all of them are. So, points off for all of this.The other merits of Zebub's films though are near-constant gratuitous nudity of his (mostly) very attractive female starlets. His women almost always are all-natural, too, which is a huge plus in my book. There are three here who are pretty scorching hot and aren't afraid to be exploited a bit because of it. On these merits, this movie is pretty great.Zebub also is pretty faithful about providing behind-the-scenes material, so there's a featurette included with cast interviews and that's interesting. Plus for this.The included second feature ""Indie Director"" actually is better than the main feature, I think. It has all of the requisite nudity (with some incredibly hot women), but the humor--most of it from Zebub as an actor, a lot of it ad-libbed--hits far more often than it misses, unlike ""Science-Less Fiction."" It's about a director's trials and tribulations as he attempts to get movies produced and distributed. Overall I actually found it to be lighthearted and fun. It is loaded down with exposition, though, so the average viewer probably won't enjoy it so much. Just look for the naked women and it will be worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8RQWGKK132P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1D3AFO#wasThisHelpful","R2I8RQWGKK132P","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen many, many bad movies in my life, but it's not mere hype to say that this is, indeed, the worst movie that I've ever seen--minus the one and ONLY one redeeming factor, and that's the female nudity (which is abundant). The only thing about it is that most of the girls appear to have been hired out of your local trailer park. In other words they aren't too attractive...and God knows that they can't act. But then again, neither can anybody else in this ridiculous thing.Of course it's not as if they had anything to work with in the script. The writing actually is worse than the acting. The line ""Thanks for the crystal meth!"" occurs MORE THAN ONCE in the film. And the ""plot"" sort of meanders around; something about vampires and drugs. To be honest I'm not sure exactly how the movie ended because I watched the last 30 minutes at 32x speed, but it's not nearly as bloody as the title suggests.But even worse than the acting OR the writing are the production values and editing. Holy moley. I've seen cheaply-made movies before but this one pretty clearly was shot on a consumer-grade videocamera, with all of the audio from the on-board mic, and maybe one keylight. Then they edited the thing together in an afternoon and didn't pay close attention to silly little things like logic.How this ever made it all the way to mass distribution, I will never know.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNUW25MGWB35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055O0ZPG#wasThisHelpful","R1KNUW25MGWB35","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Totally agree with another reviewer who says that John Cross doesn't ever shut up and thinks that he's hilarious--he tends to be the worst thing about his own productions.

"Foolishly, I purchased another one of these old Vivid presentations. Some of them are really, really good, but most of them suck, and this one--with the exception of the lengthy list of bonus trailers--sucks.It's really difficult to screw up a DVD filled with hot naked women, but Vivid managed to do it with this. The first problem is that the women don't get naked enough, or often enough. Seriously, it's surprising how many times that the models are shown but never actually disrobe. Or maybe disrobe only partly. There is some full frontal but absolutely no explicit nudity, and from a company like Vivid, you'd expect more. I've seen other Vivid DVDs that did show more.The women are OK--some of them very nice. But none of them are so nice as to overcome the deep flaws in this program. The herky-jerky slow-mo scenes are just absurd; the main feature has a run time of only about 45 minutes anyway, but there really is only about 20 minutes of footage in real time, with everything else in super slow-mo or simply duplicated.Truly an awful effort, and this doesn't even get into the poor picture quality--something you'd expect given the age and that it came from old VHS masters.The only redeeming quality is the huge list of trailers, which show full nudity.

"If I had to describe this in one word it would be ""weird."" Not because it turns our familiar Star Wars universe upside-down (although it does do that), but because the story itself is just kind of strange. I definitely see huge Flash Gordon influence here--felt like I was reading a Flash Gordon strip, or maybe even scenes out of ""Dune."" More philosophical, with less of an emphasis on advanced technology than the Star Wars that we know, ""The Star Wars"" actually has a much tighter internal consistency than the final product. And it's a story that, in movie form, I would have liked to have seen but definitely would not have been a major hit. A cult hit, for sure.Those who have criticized the story for lacking action and not really going anywhere are right, in large part. It isn't helped by the fact that so much of of the adventure seems to take place between panels, almost as if they put it together while working on tight deadlines or severely limiting space/page count. As a result, everything feels rushed and time-compressed. Heck, the princess and Annikin supposedly ""fall in love"" over a period of time that can't be more than a day or two. Very ""Romeo and Juliet"" I guess. What is left being is exceedingly difficult to follow in spots.Still, it makes for an interesting read if you're a fan of the franchise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FUEMP9LLYH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616554258#wasThisHelpful","R38FUEMP9LLYH9","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As much as I've always loved Jim Gaffigan, by now his act has gotten pretty tired.

It's not that it isn't funny; it's that it was funnier the first 15 times that we heard it. Gaffigan's first Comedy Central stand-up special, which was delivered in a laid-back style, still remains his best after all of these years, one because it was much less frenetic (and better-paced) than it became later, and two because he hadn't settled into his later patterns.Gaffigan's still worth listening to, and probably will sound much funnier to those who don't own all of his specials the way that I do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JHL1PE0MNQY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ8TQMG#wasThisHelpful","R2JHL1PE0MNQY9","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third movie in this series that I've seen and unfortunately, this doesn't live up to the other two. There is a copious amount of female (and for that matter male) nudity, much of it graphic in nature, and of course there are several hard-core sex scenes. The girls are hot. All of that is good. But what is so disappointing is the lack of fun and silliness of other movies in the series. The comical touch is grossly missing from this one. There are stabbing attempts at it--the plot itself involves two men who are headed to the same girls' boarding school to administer a miracle powder, one a horny powder, the other an ""unhorny"" powder, and neither knows about the other. But the writing isn't sharp and the gags don't hit. A significant amount of run time is devoted to the climactic orgy scene; it runs for nearly 10 minutes, but more of it is women and men running around than actual sex. Another particular scene was violent and uncomfortable for me to watch.

"Responding to this as honestly as possible, I have no idea what the point of this godawful movie was supposed to be. I'm not exactly a simpleton, nor am I a newcomer to European cinema. I've seen quite a lot of it that I enjoyed. This, though, is drivel.The plot goes nowhere, the characters are like balsa cutouts and the sex--which really is why people would pay attention to this in the first place--is not plentiful or titillating enough to make the average viewer want to sit through 15-minute dialogue sequences. The three women who make appearances in sex scenes are very attractive, but I'd stop well short of describing them as ""sexy."" Something is missing there--spirit, something, I'm not sure. The sex scenes themselves are OK, not great, and just ""OK"" isn't going to cut it in a movie that otherwise is so weighed down with boring dialogue that I very nearly fell asleep.I don't even want to bring up the utterly ridiculous ending, which feels as out of place here as would my grandmother at a furry convention.

"Well...I have to confess that I'm rather sad to see this series come to an end. Not because I felt that it needed to go on longer (and I guess technically it DID go on longer, extended through a sixth season which pretty much a whole new cast), but because at its highest point I really enjoyed it and went through a lot of life changes over the same five years that it aired with Holly, Bridget and Kendra.As seasons of this series go, this one wasn't the best. There were only 16 episodes and a lot of rehashing. Even the commentary track, which typically has been one of the high points of these DVD releases, was filled with a lot of dead air and not as much behind-the-scenes background tidbits as other releases. But it still was watchable and entertaining, particularly because it was pretty packed with nudity. The couple of seasons before this one had strayed away from that formula a bit.Probably saddest of all to me has been the complete collapse of the Playboy empire in the years since this show limped to its conclusion. It really has been something to see. It could be (and has been) argued that Playboy launched the sexual revolution. It was a juggernaut in the '50s and '60s before getting its head kicked in in the '70s for being, of all things, too conservative for audiences. It nearly died in the '80s before being revived by home video and its cable channel and strengthened in the '90s largely because of the star power of Carmen Electra, Jenny McCarthy, Anna Nicole Smith and of course, Pamela Anderson. But Playboy was in a precarious position again by the mid 2000s, again because it was too conservative for mainstream audiences who could get hard-core pornography for free anytime on the Internet.And then this show came along and actually vaulted the Playboy brand to unforeseen and unprecedented heights. For its first three years it soared, opening Playboy up to a whole new, and young, world. Suddenly every girl wanted that little rabbit head on her body.Just like every other reality series, though, ""The Girls Next Door"" had a shelf life, and when it died, the last gasp of the Playboy empire died with it. You had the unfortunate convergence of an aged corporate figurehead whose health began failing, the loss of the brand's biggest stars, a kind of public exhaustion brought about by overexposure and--probably the nail in the coffin--the inability of the crumbling empire to evolve adequately with the times. Specifically, nobody buys magazines anymore, even ones with gorgeous naked women all through them. Playboy never really seemed to figure out how to make the Internet work for itself.So anyway, all of that has been very sad for me to see, and it's my guess that this show will for all time remain the last relevance of a dying iconic American brand. You have to wonder though if Kendra, Holly and Bridget realized it. They certainly didn't in 2009 when this season wrapped, but they might today. And if they don't today, surely they will one day. I think that all of us will.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRK8CLZHLTJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050BPZHW#wasThisHelpful","RLRK8CLZHLTJG","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic collection. One disc is the TV special itself, and the other two are behind-the-scenes featurettes and historical pieces. My only complaint is that there is a fair amount repetition here among the additional features. That keeps it from being five stars, but this still is worthy of viewing even if you have only a passing interest in Motown.

"The ONLY reason why this rises to three stars is because of the extras. Both of the features included here are terrible and boring. In their day I'm sure that they were hot; ""Notorious Daughter"" is from 1964 and has very little exposure, and ""Head Mistress"" is from the late '60s and features much more, but neither of them is very interesting.Without extras we're looking at a two-star review here, if not a one-star.

"""Voyeur"" is the best erotic TV series that I've ever seen. Smartly-produced, incredibly creative and sexy as hell, it's everything that you'd want in something like this: Well-acted, well-scripted (the writing is almost stunningly good in context) and a cast of some of the hottest women you could collect on screen. The pacing also is ideal; it doesn't get bogged down in exposition or sex scenes that go on too long. And the intelligent presentation of non-linear storytelling is pretty much unheard of in this genre.The only downside--and it's a big one for me--is that the nudity isn't graphic in nature. The sex scenes, which are plentiful (as you'd expect) are very, VERY well-done, but the exposure doesn't go beyond full-frontal. If we got some additional exposure ""downstairs,"" this would have gotten five stars from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LWFHZV0WWCGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BGQU1Q#wasThisHelpful","R2LWFHZV0WWCGQ","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Sinful Intrigue"" is a terrible, terrible movie--darn near unwatchable, actually, and thank God that there are naked breasts on screen for about 80 percent of the hour and a half runtime or there would be absolutely no reason ever to put this thing into a DVD player.Even at that, the quality of the bosoms in question are so subpar that this still doesn't chart very high on the review-o-meter. Not a single solitary pair of real ones in the entire film, and trust me, a LOT of women get topless in this forgettable flop. Pretty reflective of the time period: False blonds with flat butts and $5,800 boob jobs.That in itself, of course, isn't what makes this a bad movie. Pretty much everything else about it does: The acting is atrocious (star Beckie Mullen's turn is so horrendous that you might end up physically ill, as I did--there's a reason why she never headlined another film); the writing is just as bad (meandering, nonsensical plot and way too many characters that are interchangeable). Despite the frequency of the nude scenes, the pacing is godawful and you'll find yourself wondering when the hell that it's going to be over. The nude scenes themselves aren't even fulfilling, as there are only two instances of full frontal and those are quite brief. This was the heyday of the erotic thriller so I can't quite figure out why the creators couldn't seem to do any better.I'd suggest passing on this one. Your 90 minutes is better spent doing almost anything else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0QQSLJXQP8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EWBO90#wasThisHelpful","R2B0QQSLJXQP8G","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Out of all of the ""Before Watchmen"" stories, I--as many others, I am certain--most looked forward to ""Rorschach."" Boy, what a disappointment. The off-center mystery that surrounded the character, which made him not just a comic book but an actual literary icon, is all but gone here. We see him do things and say things that never would have happened in Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"" universe. We see him make too many mistakes, be far too flippant about being unmasked, actually curse multiple times (not something that Rorschach was known for), stopping just shy of getting involved with a woman. We see him caught and beaten by his enemies and that just wouldn't have happened. Like Sherlock Holmes' flopping on a case. If anything the Comedian storyline is even worse and MORE unbelievable. The character doesn't even have consistency internal to this particular story,  much less consistent with Moore's vision. Instead of having more clarity about Blake, I have less.Clarity of purpose is what separated these two characters from basically everybody else in their universe, and these stories manage to muddle that up entirely. I think that the point was to try to make them more interesting, but instead they are less.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41A3HOOEVC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401245137#wasThisHelpful","R41A3HOOEVC7","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the two collections, the Minuteman one easily surpasses the other. But I can't help but think that the writers and artists here were going way too far to try to shock (or tantalize), almost like ""One nipple in the original? We'll give you TWO!"" or ""One gay sex scene in the original? We'll triple it!"" So much of what was great about ""Watchmen"" was what was implied, what took place between the panels. And the shock that showed on the character's faces was adequate enough to tell us what went unspoken. ""Before Watchmen"" strikes me as gratuitous: Far more blood, far more gore, far more sex, far more cursing even. And in some cases the characters don't seem to be ""themselves"" based on what we knew of them in the original.Seeing more of the Minutemen in action was interesting and held my attention, although things did go down a far darker road than I think that was necessary or, I would argue, even believable. The Silk Spectre story was incredibly light-weight by comparison and while it had a couple of nice moments, by and large was forgettable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7A0GYSRMZN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401245129#wasThisHelpful","RO7A0GYSRMZN1","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each of these ""Before Watchmen"" collections are uneven and nowhere near on the level of their predecessor, the immaculate ""Watchmen"" by Alan Moore. This one is better than the others, I think, largely on the strength of the Nite Owl collection which is the best of the lot, providing interesting insight into Dan's relationship with the iconic Rorshach.The Dr. Manhattan collection tries too hard to be pseudo-scientific and philosophical, at the same time doing neither effectively. It does give us a few interesting moments with Ozymandias but aside from that, it's more or less an alternate ending story that to me does not match up with the Dr. Manhattan character that we came to know in the original.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2784RSK1W5194/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401245145#wasThisHelpful","R2784RSK1W5194","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good: Functional, ""open"" design, great for my purposes. The tiered levels are great and I'm sure that even the outdated CD racks will prove to be useful. Frame is sturdy.The bad: While the frame is sturdy, the desktop itself is supported by just four screws and in the case of my desk in particular, one of the crossbars that are supposed to support both the weight of the desktop AND the pull-out keyboard shelf broke when trying to put it together. I tried super gluing it to no avail. I ended up leaving the keyboard tray off (I was unlikely to use it anyway) but I'm still concerned about the longevity of this desk when one corner of it is more or less just propped together.Basically this is cheaply-made despite its interesting, effective design, and I can't believe that it's going to equal the lifespan of the desk that it's replacing in my office, which also was a home-construction job but lasted more than 18 years and actually I still could be using.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMU5DXCSJ78Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EFO0SO#wasThisHelpful","RMU5DXCSJ78Q8","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll open by saying that four stars is too generous, but three didn't seem to be quite good enough. As stripper DVDs go this one is merely above average. It's good because the dancers go fully nude and leave absolutely nothing to the imagination (particularly to the imagination of the guys--and in one case girl--who are fortunate enough to be the objects of the lap dances). It's not so good because most of the women don't look all that great and because in several cases they look as if they're actually trying to hurt the guys who they're supposed to be dancing for, rather than giving them pleasure. You'd have to see it for yourself to know what I'm talking about, but they spastically bounce on their laps, chests, even shoulders, at a high rate of speed and force. Nothing sexy about it, and I'm guessing that these dudes ended up sore and bruised as a result. You also have to keep in mind that this was produced in the late '90s and our standards of beauty have changed some since then--here there are a lot of cheap breast implants and flat butts.The extras are wide and deep and that helps make this a four-star review, although I believe that saying that it's a ""four-hour disc"" (as the jacket states) is stretching things a bit. The actual presentation is about 85 minutes, which compared with some other Vivid DVDs in this genre is pretty good particularly since there is little to no slow motion, a trick that Vivid  often employs to stretch 20 minutes of footage into 45. You see a lot of that in the extras--mostly previews of other Vivid programs. There are lots of them, but nearly all are videos shown at half speed or slower.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAGSIWHI9J51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00158OB10#wasThisHelpful","R1UAGSIWHI9J51","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This actually is a collection of seven mini-episodes of an old (1997) series, rather than two separate feature films the way that it's been marketed.That in itself isn't a problem. What is a problem is that, from what I can tell, it wasn't a good series to start with. It doesn't go nearly far enough to be sexy the way that some later similar series did, although I see a lot of evidence that this was edited to death before release. In fact one of the little episodes has no nudity in it at all, which is just unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. We aren't buying this crap for its horrendous soundtrack, after all (and make no mistake about it--it's horrendous).The women (including a young Beverly Lynne, dispelling the myth that she actually was born old--and an old Monique Parent who, apparently, actually WAS born old) are not very attractive and we wouldn't really be able to the ones who do look pretty good because the cameras just don't show us much.

"Hard to know exactly how to rate this one. If half stars were an option, I'd give it two and a half.It IS entertaining in a bizarre kind of way. Anything with Uschi Digard deserves a look, and there are a couple of other attractive women here. None of them gets naked all that much, even though the plot involves a prostitution operation aimed at truckers. No full nudity at all, which is disappointing.More disappointing is the transfer (really, really, REALLY bad in places--there's a scene near the end that's so dark that you seriously can't make out any shapes--just one very small swash of red--for close to 30 seconds). I understand that this is taken from the best source material available. Just get ready to be annoyed at least a little by the reality of that.The part of this that's actually entertaining is the ineptness of the filmmakers and the willingness to cut pretty much every corner to get this film released. It's right up there with some of the worst movies I've ever seen from that standpoint. I had trouble figuring out what was going on through much of it, despite a fairly noble effort by the lead actors. The cinematography is awful (poor cropping, out-of-focus shots, bad lighting); the audio is atrocious (ADR that sounds like it was recorded in a cement basement); the editing is non-existent (dropped or flubbed lines seemed to be no big deal). But the biggest head-scratcher of all is that from all that I can figure out, a fairly  significant plot point was rewritten after being shot, yet both scenes still remain in the film making the final product a totally nonsensical wreck.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4B1M9A1OKXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G1L6W2C#wasThisHelpful","R3U4B1M9A1OKXC","A2MF0N72JVXDAP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF0N72JVXDAP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got my copy of this book this morning and have been reading it all afternoon.  I am an intermediate/advanced DIYer and have installed a lot of forced induction systems in BMW's and Porsches.  I enjoy doing my own maintenance and was excited to get another reference for my 997.1 C4S.  The book is very well produced and the numerous color photos are of high quality.Initially I got a little frustrated when I started reading the projects.  One project I wanted to try was to replace the clutch someday soon but the Clutch project seemed to leave just enough holes in the procedures that you could get yourself into trouble.  Step 1) Remove transmission, Step 2) Remove flywheel bolts...etc.  I kind of stepped back because there is a lot of additional steps to get to this point.  Fortunately, I discovered that ""Step one"" is itself its own project (# 38).  Still after reading Project #38 I still kind of was a little fuzzy on how to get passed some areas.Throughout the book I got the feeling that this book was written with a 996 almost exclusively.  Every once in a while there would be a comment such as  ""If you have a 997, take this off too""?? !!I mostly like the book.  When I tackle a project, I'll use it as another reference along with the shop manuals and hopefully some detailed DIY instructions on 6speedonline or Rennlist.  Between these three sources of information and the pictures in this book, I should be able to tackle the project.  And if not, I have a great indy mechanic that will be happy to take my money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HSEZFK0PYW48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760344035#wasThisHelpful","R2HSEZFK0PYW48","A28HUBMSCXVQW0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28HUBMSCXVQW0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to plan ahead for this heater by installing the correct 250V/30A plug.  I fired up this heater in my 20 x 20 garage and started testing.  The garage was 33 degrees F at the start.  After one hour, the garage had warmed up to 41F, after an hour and 1/2, 45F.  I confirmed that the heater was pulling about 5500watts.  The fan did rattle a little bit after the first thirty minutes but when I readjusted the fan, it stopped rattling??  So, it looks like I can plan about 8 degrees F per hour to warm up the garage.  I suppose that I can turn it on in the morning and the garage will be warm by lunch time.  I can work with that....

If you dont have a C wire on your old thermostat, you might need some help to identify the proper power wire on your furnace/blower circuit board.  Once I got passed that, it was smooth sailing.  The thermostat works great and the programming is intuitive.  I like the Android app to check on the system.  My wife likes that it tells you the outside air temp and humidity (via WiFi).  Better than the NEST for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3X7DRSL1IG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLZEQH2#wasThisHelpful","R3O3X7DRSL1IG1","A28HUBMSCXVQW0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28HUBMSCXVQW0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a better scope for looking at small SMD soldering.  I originally went with the USB microscopes but they were a pain to use.  I saw an electronics guru at a convention using this exact scope so I had to try it.Amazing clarity and function.  Very easy to adjust, plenty of room to place the viewing item.  I love the stereoscopic viewing, WOW!  I was worried that I might need more magnification than 60X for SMD but I usually use 10X.  At 30X I can see the very tiny imperfections in the 0402 components.  I cant imagine 60X. The lighting system is more than enough for me.I have ZERO complaints, this is an awesome scope in my book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9P806AW0LX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SQQCHC#wasThisHelpful","R3O9P806AW0LX7","A28HUBMSCXVQW0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28HUBMSCXVQW0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As long as you know that the Chromecast needs Chrome to run and can only watch Netflix, Youtube, or surf the web via Chrome, then this device will work fine for you.A big issue that bummed me out was I thought I could take it on the road and watch Netflix on my hotel TV.  The Chromecast has to be on the same network as the laptop and the Chromecast can't communicate with any hotel router that asks a question for entry such as ""Do you agree with these terms?"" or ""What room are you in?""  Chromecast has no provisions for logging into wireless networks therefore it is only useable on home networks. I'm picking up a TPLink mr3040 portable router and will try to get Chromecast to work in the hotel that way but it is getting to be a PITA.As for how Chromecast works at home, it is pretty cool, the kids are starting to use it to watch youtube videos and play music videos from their Android phones.  I like it for browsing the web.This product has huge potential but it is too restricted now... I'd give it a year.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1RQB385BVTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR0PDNE#wasThisHelpful","RQ1RQB385BVTJ","A28HUBMSCXVQW0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28HUBMSCXVQW0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried several different thin batteries for the Galaxy S3, EZO, RAV, Samsung.  I've also tried the 4400 Hyperion battery.  None of the 2100mah class thin batteries were outstanding and could barely make it a full day of moderate use before draining to zero.  I then tried the 4400mah and it did the job for sure but was a little bulky.This Samsung 3000mah battery is perfect.  It lasts all day with moderate/heavy use and still has about 30% at the end of the day.  It isn't too bulky and just barely thicker than the original 2100mah battery and case.  I added the Diztronic TPU case to this setup and it feels perfect.  It also still fits in my EZOpower usb cradle with the 3000mah battery and TPU case (bonus).Highly recommended :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9RURLLAF5T2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMQ56QE#wasThisHelpful","R9RURLLAF5T2G","A28HUBMSCXVQW0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28HUBMSCXVQW0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading the reviews I thought I would try these batteries.  I've tested a lot of batteries for the Samsung Galaxy S3 and have yet found any great batteries.  These RAVPower batteries didn't charge up to the full 2250mah (Averaged about 1850mah) and died faster than the stock Samsung 2100mah battery.  I was using the EZOpower 2100mah battery for a while and it did well until about the 4 month mark.  The EZOpower batteries finally started losing capacity.

" 6:23 MinsMy nephew Karson is 6.  He has adhd.  He is very smart and has a hard time paying attention.  He had gotten one of those small lego sets that you buy at the store.  It has the pictures in so he could figure it out.  He's just now learning to read.  He's in first grade.  He has no problem putting these things together.  He was so focused on it.  It seemed to calm him down and he stayed so focused on it.  He had it put together in just a few minutes.  I had no idea what a lego table was.  I searched amazon and found this great table by Fight Back For Autism.I have heard a lot about this company.  The money goes to people with autism.  It's a great way to give back.  Then I found out they give Veterans a job packaging the tables for shipment.  There was a lot of bubble wrap on them and very secure in the box it came in.  It was taped up tight.  That was fun getting it out of the box.  Karson helped me all the way to the end.  I just had to remind him what we were doing.This table comes with a top that has a smooth surface for cleaning.  It was so easy to put together Karson helped.  It has a double sided screw that goes into the leg and you just use some elbow work to get it in.  Very easy.  I was thinking that is all.  I really thought there would be more to it.  The table is very sturdy.  Karson's 2 year old brother Konnor sat on it to try it out.  We had fun putting the table together.  Got some muscles.The legs are very sturdy and not wobbly.  We did an earthquake check just to make sure.  I also loved the felt on the bottom of the legs.  Konnor's mom was relived with it also she has wooden floors.  They scratch so easily.  It was a nice added bonus to the table.Karson had a bucket of legos, big legos to small.  He even had some duplex.  I put them all on the table to make sure they all fit.  I took my fingers and did a test.  They were all stable on the table.  They did not budge.  Karson is very thankful for his table.  It helps contain the legos.  His brother is still learning not to stick things in his mouth and ears.  This will help control it some and he can play with them to.The table is a great size.  I fit at it and I'm the biggest.  :)  Karson fit it just well sitting or on his knees like I was doing.  Or he could get a chair and sit next to it.  Konnor can stand up to it.  He could also sit in a chair with it.  They both have wild imaginations and I see them spending a lot of time at the table.  I have no doubt that it will last a long time and I see it growing with them.We would also like to take a minute and thank you all for putting together a great table that is making two little boys very happy.  It's going to help with their mind development and imagination.  I did get this table free for an honest review.  All opinions are mine.  Konnor and Karson have just told me what they thought of the table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123WCYEW1C77D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC8B0S2#wasThisHelpful","R123WCYEW1C77D","A1UXNOX03UE9F4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UXNOX03UE9F4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was so easy to put together Karson helped.  It has a double sided screw that goes into the leg and you just use some elbow work to get it in.  Very easy.  I was thinking that is all.  I really thought there would be more to it.  The table is very sturdy.  Karson's 2 year old brother Konnor sat on it to try it out.  We had fun putting the table together.  Got some muscles.The legs are very sturdy and not wobbly.  We did an earthquake check just to make sure.  I also loved the felt on the bottom of the legs.  Konnor's mom was relived with it also she has wooden floors.  They scratch so easily.  It was a nice added bonus to the table.Karson had a bucket of legos, big legos to small.  He even had some duplex.  I put them all on the table to make sure they all fit.  I took my fingers and did a test.  They were all stable on the table.  They did not budge.  Karson is very thankful for his table.  It helps contain the legos.  His brother is still learning not to stick things in his mouth and ears.  This will help control it some and he can play with them to.The table is a great size.  I fit at it and I'm the biggest.  :)  Karson fit it just well sitting or on his knees like I was doing.  Or he could get a chair and sit next to it.  Konnor can stand up to it.  He could also sit in a chair with it.  They both have wild imaginations and I see them spending a lot of time at the table.  I have no doubt that it will last a long time and I see it growing with them.We would also like to take a minute and thank you all for putting together a great table that is making two little boys very happy.  It's going to help with their mind development and imagination.  I did get this table free for an honest review.  All opinions are mine.  Konnor and Karson have just told me what they thought of the table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEUPB74TFZP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HRGIAY#wasThisHelpful","RNEUPB74TFZP4","A1UXNOX03UE9F4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UXNOX03UE9F4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Happy Henry is the funniest wine stopper I ever seen! I promise he will be a great conversation starter at your next get together. Your guest have no idea what to expect when they pull this stopper from the wine bottle. Happy Henry has brought a lot of laughter to my parties since he has became apart of my collection of great wine bottle stoppers. Not only is Happy Henry a fun novelty, he actually serves his purpose well. Happy Henry keeps my wine fresh, and I haven't had him leak (pun intended)! I store my wine in my wine cooler on it's side, and Happy Henry is the perfect size, so that he doesn't stand to far out, where I can't shut my cooler door. The box that Happy Henry arrives in, will give a laugh too. It is adorable. Don't worry about this item being to provocative for children, because most of them will ""get the joke"". They see him as he is, just a cute Happy guy! This would be a great hostess gift for any of your fun loving friends and family. I was pleasantly surprised when Happy Henry got a laugh from my 80 year old grandmother. I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This Quick Stitch sewing kit has made my life simpler! Before I ordered this great travel sewing kit, I had all of my sewing needles, thread, scissors, and measuring tape scattered all over my home in different junk drawers. It took an act of congress to do a simple sewing task, such as putting a button on a shirt. With this great Premium Sewing Kit, I have everything I need in one spot, neatly placed away. I figured that this was such a great bargain the items like the scissors and needles would be flimsy, but I was proved wrong. The scissors are made from stainless steel, and are sturdy. They are the perfect size for clipping thread, and my fat fingers fit inside of the handle. The needles are also very sturdy, and the size of the eye holes, make them easy to thread. Even the straight pins are made sturdy. You get 12 different colors of thread, so you will can find a matching shade for most items. You can always add some of your favorite colors of thread, if you use a particular color more than one of the colors included in this kit. These are great little sewing kits. Perfect to send with your loved one who is leaving for college, store one in your office desk, store one in your glove compartment in your car, and it's perfect to put in an RV or camper.

"My favorite type of shoe to wear is actually not a shoe persay, but to me there is nothing more comfortable than a pair of flip flops! I have been waiting all winter to be able to slide my feet into a pair of my newest flip flops. The only downside to loving my flip flops so much is the time and money it can potentially cost, to keep my feet flip flop worthy. I am on the go, so making time to get a pedicure is almost impossible. Not only is time an issue, having to pay over $50 a session every few weeks is also a downside. I am so excited that I don't have to worry about either one of those problems this spring and summer. This FootLove Electric Callus Remover is truly a professional strength callus remover. It has just as much power as the one my manicurist uses when she gives me a pedicure. The best thing about this product is that it is electrical. I don't have to worry about buying batteries. I can simply recharge this little slice of foot heaven. I have purchased ones that do use batteries and as the batteries get used, the speed and strength slow down. I don't have to worry about losing all the great power from this one, even if it is running low on charge, you can plug it in, and use it while it is charging. The charger cord is included in the box. They also send you a great little brush that makes keeping your device super clean and sanitary. It comes with one head attached to the device, and you get a replacement head. That makes two heads in total. The replacement heads can be purchased on amazon, you get two for around $11. This FootLove Electric Callus Remover is the perfect size to take along when you travel. Even if you don't have a problem with calluses, it does an awesome job at removing dead skin. After the first use, my feet were as soft and smooth as a baby's feet, that have never been walked on. Your partner will appreciate this device too. I know my husband hates it when we are laying in bed, and my rough feet rub up against him. This is not a product just for women. It comes in a blue color also, which makes it awesome for men. I used to wish my husband would get a pedicure to deal with his dry, scalley feet. He is masculine to be caught dead walking into a salon. I know if I purchased one in blue, he would actually take the time to remover his dead skin and calluses. This device is so powerful, he could be done in less than five minutes. I am very happy with this purchase that I received a discount on, in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. In no way, was I compensated for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGXSDT2NAWTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMHIVWC#wasThisHelpful","R2NGXSDT2NAWTC","A3V1NALMIKQT29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1NALMIKQT29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an awesome deal. I was expecting a lot worse quality and speed for the price. I had intended to give this one to my 11 year old daughter, but after I received it, I decided to use it for myself, and purchase her another one. I know that sounds awful, but I am really big into couponing, and online shopping and having to use my large laptop is troublesome. If I have an online coupon it is the perfect size to carry into the stores. The size is perfect to show the cashier without eiter of you having to strain your eyes. You will just need to make sure you will have a wi-fi connection.I like the fact I can carry this tablet in my purse. You can also get a keyboard that is compatable with this tablet. The picture is clear and crisp. I do wish it would hold charge longer, but for the price I can't complain. I am planning on buying several more of these tablets to give as Christmas gifts. If you are looking for a basic tablet, without all the bells and whistles you have found it. It does have google pre-installed, so you don't have to worry about that.

"This Spiral Ninja Vegetable Spiralizer is one of the best spiralizer's I have purchased. The other ones I have purchased in the past two years have went to kitchen gadget heaven. The blades on those got dull after just a few uses. Not this Ninja Spiralizer, I have used it several weeks now, almost daily and it as sharp as it was when I received it. It comes with a cute storage pouch, and an awesome wired cleaning brush that makes cleaning an easy process. I love to use this when making my famous carrot salad. I have also tried some of the great recipe ideas that came in the recipe book, that is included in this bundle. It is a great addition to any home cook's kitchen who enjoys preparing eye pleasing, and tasteful meals. It comes with a cap that allows you to use almost all of the vegetable you are using. This helps give you more bang for your buck, since you aren't wasting food. You can allow your children to use the Ninja Spiralizer, with your supervision to make them feel they are preparing Chef quality dishes. I have really enjoyed this high quality spiralizer.

"These Sentey Pc Gaming Headset is a great value. The sound quality is really clear, with no distortion. The ear pieces are padded thickly, giving a comfortable fit.The inner headband is detachable, and goes back on with ease. The microphone is spaced from your mouth at an appropriate distance.  There is lighting to remind you that the microphone is on, so you don't have any ""OOPS did I just say that, for everyone to hear"", There is also the option of being able to turn the lights off and on is great, so that you don't disturb others around you with the LED light.

"There are several different headlamps on the market and I have purchased quite a few. I have paid any where from $5 to $50 for several different brands. If you are thinking of purchasing one, my recommendation is this Luxolite White CREE LED Headlamp. It has one of the brightest lights of any I have purchased. Not only does it have an extremely bright white light, but with a click of a button you are provided with a bright red light. I can't believe the different settings this Luxolite has to offer, especially in this price range. You can choose between six different modes. I like to keep mine on Medium, white, while I am at the river fishing. I choose the High red light, when I am riding my bike. It has an SOS flashing light feature that could assist you in finding help, if that time was to ever come. You would think that all of these more expensive headlamps would be waterproof, because the majority of people use them outdoors, but they aren't. The designers at Luxuriously Smart really put a lot of thought in effort into these features for the consumer. It being waterproof is worth the price in it's self, because with the other ones if you get them wet, you are going to have to throw it away. This would make a great Father's Day present, birthday present, or even for any young adult getting ready to go off to college. This is great for walking on campus, because it leaves your hands free.

Since a lot of drink recipes call for steps that use specific bar tools, I have tried to stock my home bar with all the tools a bartender would use. I didn't have anything to go buy when I started purchasing these items, so it has been a learn as you go. Needless, to say I didn't make the best choices when it came to some of these tool's. The first muddler I ever purchased was one made of wood. It was great for awhile, but I noticed later on, that my drinks had a different, unwanted, taste to them. I couldn't figure out what was causing this problem. A friend of mine started dating a bartender and he came to my Kentucky Derby themed party. He could tell right away, my drinks were off. He looked at my bar utensils, and right away he told solved the problem. It was time for a new muddler. He went on to tell me, since the wood was porous, it retained some of the flavors from each drink I had ever made. He is the one who recommended to me to get a stainless steel cocktail muddler. That is when I purchased this one from Decodyne. It is GREAT! It is easy to handle. The rubber end, does an excellent job, at pressing herbs like mint. The stainless steel has classy, elegant look. The best part, it's not porous, so it will last forever without changing the flavor of my drinks. This would make a great hostess gift. I was able to purchase this one at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. You can't go wrong with this purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9F6BTKBKK91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWI2IQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1X9F6BTKBKK91","A3V1NALMIKQT29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1NALMIKQT29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one super bright Barbecue Grill Light! I am amazed at just how much light it produces. We love to use our grill, it doesn't matter the season or the time of day. To be honest it is not unusual for us to fire up the grill late into the night. My family and I love to gather around on the patio and grill as much food as we can. The problems we run into when we grill so late at night is that it is hard to see the food on the grill, and to solve that problem we create another one. We cut the patio lights on, and that attracts thousands of bugs. I like to get my protein from actual cuts of meats and not bugs. Thank goodness we didn't see just how many bugs we actually grilled onto our food. With this super bright grill light, all of our problems have been sold. We can all sit on the patio with the lights off. We can actually enjoy the glow from our fire pit. Since this grill light can handle such high temps, it is close enough to the grill so that the bugs don't want to go near our food. The smoke and heat is to much from them. This light is easy to attach to your grill. You simply put it in the desired spot on your grill and turn the piece until you feel a little resistance and it is in place. The only con to this product is it is brighter than most flashlights, and it may cause some conflict because you will eventually catch someone taking it off the grill, and using it as a flashlight. HA! HA! I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I highly recommend this product for anyone who loves to grill. It even comes with batteries, so you can use it as soon as you receive it. It would make an excellent Father's Day present, or a great birthday gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BEIN1SYUA1B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR99G7Y#wasThisHelpful","R1BEIN1SYUA1B7","A3V1NALMIKQT29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1NALMIKQT29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really impressed with this Skin Brightening & Anti-Aging face scrub. One of the great things about this scrub is that it is formulated for women and men. It doesn't have any added color or a strong perfume smell. Since it isn't tailored for just women, both my husband and I have been using this scrub. I love how it penatrates deep into my pores to give my husband and I a great deep clean. Since it is such a great high quality scrub it helps with removing dead skin cells, and our faces look rejuvanted. As soon as we are done using it, our skin has a bright youthful glow. I gave this product four stars instead of five, because I haven't used it long enough to tell a difference in my fine lines and age spots. I do feel as though I will see more dramatic results after using it for at least a month. This product is made in the USA, and has 1a 00% Satisfaction Guarantee.

"I have been taking this product for over three weeks now, and I can really tell a difference in how hydrated my skin feels. I would have given this five stars, but I don't feel as though I am going to see the effects of a face lift. I do have faith that my fine lines will seem to disappear because my skin is so hydrated, I know that this will cause my face to be fuller filling in those fine lines. The thing I really like about this product is that it isn't another drooling step in my daily morning or evening routine. I have to admit I get a little tired of applying so many products to skin. These capsules of Phytoceramides are working from the inside, out. I like to think that it is helping my inner beauty shine through. The capsules are easy to swallow, and you only have to take one a day. A lot of supplements require you take two capsules, and not only that it's usually twice daily. I am very cautious about taking supplements that aren't made in the USA because they are not always regulated by the FDA. That's not the case with Schwartz Bioresearch, they are made in the USA and are tested by a third party. I looked them up online to make sure these statements were true. With all the vitamins that are packed in these you know these have to have an positive effect on your skin.

"I always feel safe trying new products when it has a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. When I see this advertised it let's me know that the company believes in it's product. After using this InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, I knew I wouldn't be needing to bother with the guarantee. I was first attracted to this product because it was a cleanser and not a cream. I love the benefits of Vitamin C, but I don't like wearing heavy creams during the warmer months. Not only do I get the benefits of the Vitamin C, but it works great as a cleanser. It does a great job at removing dirt, and helps keep my pores clean. I have been using this InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Cleanser for over a week now, and I can tell a big difference in my skin tone, it looks brighter. My skin feels as smooth as a baby's bottom! A little of this product goes a long way, and the pump that is included dispense's the perfect amount each time.

"This Era Organics Eczema & Psoriasis Cream has given me some much needed relief from my eczema. I have always had to deal with extremely dry skin. I have never been diagnosed but I know it is eczema. I work in health care, and I am constantly washing my hands. This only makes the eczema flare up and become inflamed. My insurance doesn't pay for any prescribed skin creams, so it is up to me to find comfort. I choose this one from Era Organics for many reasons. One of the many reasons is the cream has no added coloring, or perfumes which is one of the reasons it is great for treating and relief from eczema and psoriasis. This cream is thick and a little goes a long way. Like I said before I wash my hands numerous times a day, and I can still feel the benefits even after several hand washes. When I am not at work and having to wash my hands as much it last for several hours. Since this cream worked so well on my eczema I decided to try some on my face. I was amazed at how soft it made my skin feel. It didn't even clog pores! I also love the fact that this cream is made in the USA, so I feel good that I am buying a product that is employing people in America.

"It is amazing at how realistic these Lucentee Silly Candy Molds made my chocolate candy look like actual Lego pieces. My best friend owns a party planning and catering business that host a lot of children's birthday parties. She calls upon me on occasion to make chocolates to decorate cakes and cupcakes that serves at the parties. Ever since they made the LEGO movie, she has had a lot of request to host LEGO themed parties. When I saw this three piece silicone set, I knew I had to try them as chocolate molds.The great thing about this silicone is that you can use these in the microwave or even the freezer!  As I said before, they turned out to look like actual LEGO pieces. My children had so much fun eating the ""test"" batch, I decided to make some jello snacks with the molds. They turned out just as great. With a lot of other molds I use, I have to spray them with cooking spray so they release the ingredients without breaking. There is no need for spraying when I use these silicone molds. They finished product pops right. Cleaning them is also easy, because nothing sticks to creases. If you don't want to wash them off in the sink, you can put them on the top shelf of your dishwasher.I couldn't be more pleased with this product. The things you can create with them is only limited to your imagination. If you aren't the creative type don't worry because Lucentee sends you a great ebook with lots of ideas.

"I can't believe how clean this Konjac Sponge gets my face. Who would have ever thought that you could get a deep clean with a sponge. It is the perfect size for cleaning those hard to reach places, like around your nose. It can fit in the palm on your hand. It is a little larger than egg. Since it is a sponge, it can conform to your facial features cleaning every spot. I was amazed that I didn't even have to use my facial scrub to clean the dirt from my pores. You can't use this right away, even though you won't to, because you need to soak it in water to soften it. There is a looped, thick, soft, twisted string attached ot the sponge which is great for storing. I hang mine from the shower caddy. I love that these are not tested on animals like so many other beauty products. Each time I use this Konjac sponge, my face feels softer and softer. It is perfect to help prevent breakouts if you have oily skin. I can also let you know if you have sensitive skin, you will be safe using this sponge. I have very sensitive skin, and yet I have had no problems with my skin sensitivity while using this sponge.

"You know you are getting a great product when the seller backs it with a life time warranty. I am very pleased with this Deluxe Running Belt, by Above Elite. Most running belts have one small pouch that you might be able to fit a small phone and a couple of dollar bills in, but not this one. It is truly a deluxe running belt. You have not one, but two roomy pouches. It is very light weight, you can hardly tell you are wearing it at all. I love this because I don't want to weighed down while I am doing my daily run. The reflective strips are large enough that they can be seen, especially by someone driving by you. This is very important when you are jogging or running through your neighborhood. These are so reflective I feel safe letting my son use it, just for that fact alone. The straps are adjustable so it can fit almost anyone. This would make a great gift for anyone that is into fitness. You don't have to use it just for running. Anyone who walks would appreciate all the features too. I have even wore mine to the seven mile yard sale that is hosted in a nearby town. It was perfect to carry my money and phone in. Since we were walking along the streets that day, I felt protected since I had the reflective strips.

"I loved the fact that when I opened up this shower curtain liner, I wasn't knocked down by a strong scent of chemicals. I know the product description was true to it's word, by the simple fact I didn't get knocked down by that chemical odor. It is a non toxic product, which is something I appreciate since my children come in contact with the shower curtains when they are in the bath tub. Since it is ANTI-BACTERIAL, I won't have to worry about seeing mold and mildew building up on it.

"This is a great all natural and organic serum. I have been using it for the last couple of weeks and can already tell a difference. I love the way that it absorbs quickly into my skin. The dropper is great because it allows you to control the amount of product that you are dispensing. It doesn't have a strong odor, like a lot of other Vitamin C serums. This doesn't leave your face feeling oily, but it does leave it feeling soft and gives your face a bright glow. I use this twice daily. Once in the mornings before applying my make-up, and onec before bed time. My husband even noticed something was different about my skin. I can't keep his hands from my face, because he says it feels so smooth and soft.

"Wine is one of my favorite luxuries in life. I not only love to drink wine, but I love to give wine as hostess, birthday, and Christmas gifts. I am always looking for great products to enhance my wine drinking experiences for myself, and also to add to my bottles of wine that I gift. I am happy that this is one of those items. I rarely see a corkscrew and a vacuum wine stopper sold as a set. This is a great duo to purchase for yourself or as a gift. The corkscrew is the type that I desire. The handle at the top makes opening a bottle of wine easy, and allows for you to have a sturdy control. I think this corkscrew looks classy when you open a bottle of wine at the table. After you have poured everyone a glass, you can simply use this great vacuum stopper to seal the unpoured wine. I love the fact this is a vacuum stopper, because it can help preserve your opened bottles of wine. I have used this stopper on two different bottles, and have days later the wine still had all the aroma, and notes of flavor. This is an awesome set, that seems to made high quality materials, and I feel like it could last for years to come. As an added bonus, you get a cute magnet, mine is on my wine cooler!

"This rabbit can hide in rabbit den anytime! You can expect nothing less than pure bliss when you purchase and use this Utimi 6 speed vibe. I was excited to find one at such a reasonable price. This is one adult novelty that will have you hopping in the bedroom. There are so many features on this one vibe, you won't need another one. For starters it has 6 speeds so you will find the one you want every time. You can have it rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise easily with the simple push of a button. You would think with all the features there would be an endless amount of buttons, but I am happy to say there is only three. One that turns it on and off, one for the different speeds, and my favorite button to push is the counter clock wise button. These are all located at the base, for easy reach. It is also lit by a LED light, so that if you are playing in the dark, it can't hop out of your site. There isn't a spot on the female anatomy that this rabbit can't please. It is made from durable silicone, and is easy to clean with soap and water. I prefer using a cleanser made especially for adult toys. Don't forget you can play in the shower with this one. It is fairly quite, but the higher the speed you choose, the more sound you can hear. Don't get me wrong, for a toy as powerful as this, it is still quite.

"I hate the smell and feel of bug and mosquito sprays, so I was super excited to try these Kinven Mosquito Bug Insect Repellent Bands. We spend a lot of time in the outdoors so I am always purchasing products as mosquito and bug repellents. Mosquito's carry a wide range of diseases, and I like to keep my family protected. The great thing about these bands, is they look like a stylish bracelet, and you don't have a sticky residue left on your skin, like you do with the type of repellents you apply to your skin. When you are wearing these bands, you don't have to worry about reapplying repellents over and over. The best part is that these bands work. You also get more than one use. I have wore silver one three times now, and I even wore it while swimming in the river. I am happy to say it is still repelling mosquito's after these uses. These bands can fit almost every member of your family. I know that they fit everyone in my family ranging from my five year old daughter, up to my larger wrist sized husband. Don't worry if you have boy's, because its unisex style will be great for males or females. The most important thing is it is keeping you and your protected. You can say a lot of money because these are reuseable unlike those costly sprays. I received this purchase at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love the look and feel of this Clementine Flowy Long Racerback Tank Top! It is one of the softest tank top's I now own. I purchased mine in white, but here are at least 15 different colors to choose from, which is why I know I will be ordering more. This is made from very light weight material which makes it perfect for the summer months, or to wear during a workout. It is longer than most tank tops, which I love since I am a bigger girl, and I like for shirts to cover my lower stomach. I have washed mine approximately five times and it has held up well. The white is still a beautiful white color, and it has remained in great condition, and it still  fits as well as it did when I first received it. Like with most white clothing, you can see through it when you are in certain lighting and outside in the sun. I can't say enough about how comfortable this tank top is to wear.

"I purchased this product for a family member who has a severe pain due to hemmorids. He is in pain the majority of time, because he has no health insurance to have them removed. I have even seen him use pillows to sit on, for some added comfort. He is a larger size male, and most of the cushions we have purchased for him don't hold up to his weight. I am thrilled to say that we have found him comfort in this inflatable donut cushion. This comes in two different colors, blue happens to be his favorite color, so I choose that option. The great thing about this inflatable cushion is that you can adjust the firmness by applying more or less air.The air is easy to get into the cushion, since it comes with a great hand held manual pump. Since he is a heavier man, we don't completely fill his with air. It has provided him with much needed pain relief. It is also very easy for him to take it along with him, since you can deflate it, and it folds up nicely. In the future this will be my go to donut cushion, instead of the foam type ones, because I see how great it works, and I love that it's portable.It is simple to keep clean, the cover can be washed in the washing machine. We have washed his about three times now, and it has not lost any of the color, and it has held up nicely. I received this one at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This magnetic screen door has been such a welcomed addition to my life! I have recently been assigned the task of boxing up and cleaning out my grandfather's house, who has recently passed away. We had taken his standard, metal screen door down over a year ago, when he had to have the assistance of a walker when he was walking. The screen door was too much of a hassle to get around, and we worried he may fall. Okay, let me get to the reasons my life is easier with this magnetic screen door, and why I intend to purchase another one for my husband's garage door. For starters you can't beat the price of this product compared to a standard screen door. You are able to do so many things easier if you have this magnetic screen door, instead of the traditional ones. For example, when I am carrying heavy boxes out of my grandpaw's house, I don't have to set them down, open the door, then pick the heavy boxes back up, and repeat the same steps to close the traditional screen door. Since installing this one, I can simply walk straight through the screen door. The magnets grasp a hold of each other as soon as I pass through. No need to sit down, or pick up anything. I could tell such a difference in the time it was taking to load boxes, and in the way my legs and back felt. I wasn't in near as much pain. With the magnetic screen door in place, I was also able to enjoy the fresh breeze without worrying about being attacked by all sorts of bugs and bees. This brings me to another great reason to purchase this item. If you happen to have a loved one, who is also using walkers, canes or wheelchairs to be mobile, this is the perfect solution to the heavy traditional screen doors. They can come in and out of their home with ease, and still have the luxury of leaving their doors open to enjoy the fresh air and outdoor view without pesky bugs flying indoors. I will say that this wasn't the easiest product to install for one person. I tried this by myself, and I will admit it got a little frustrating. If you have someone to help with the installation, it should go a lot easier. The benefits are well worth the aggravation of installing it by myself. Everything is included to install the magnetic screen with to your door frame. This would be a great addition to any home with pets, that don't have a doggy door. This product does more than just keep bugs out, it makes life's chores a lot easier. I hate to prop open my screen door when I am carrying in groceries, because of all the bugs and flies that make their way indoors. These magnetic screen doors are made with high quality materials, so I feel as though it will last many years to come. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I highly suggest you put this item in your cart to purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JXCRO4UJKGE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZNOHTW#wasThisHelpful","R1JXCRO4UJKGE1","A3V1NALMIKQT29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1NALMIKQT29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Outdoor Pro Gear has made my outdoor life much more enjoyable with ""The Best LED Headlamp! I have bought my husband several different brands of headlamps to use, and have never once thought of how much easier my life could be if I would purchase one for myself. I don't know why I hadn't purchased one for myself a long time ago. I am super excited that I choose to buy this one for me. My husband is now jealous, and unappreciative of the ones I had purchased for him. I took my headlight on our latest fishing trip, and I will never go again without it. This baby is BRIGHT! It has as much if not more power than our mag light, flash lights. The adjustable straps allows you to adjust the headlamp until it fits comfortable and snug. I wore mine for over four hours, and not one time did I have to readjust it. The headlamp is attached to a movable piece. You can change the position with the ease of one hand, so you don't have to put down what you may be carrying or holding in your other hand. You can also adjust the telescope zoom from wide-angle floodlight to a narrow-focus spotlight. There are modes of lighting that are changeable by pushing the button on top of the headlamp. Again, you can do this with one hand. The headlamps that I have purchased for my husband, slip and move, when he tries to change any setting on them. None of his has the awesome strobe setting that this one has. This headlamp is worth every penny of the purchase. I have never saw a headlamp that offers such bright light! I can't say enough great things about this product. The only con to the product is that batteries were not included, but most items that require batteries, don't come with them. I received this purchase at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review..","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMDS2NT8MFXA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYK8R86#wasThisHelpful","RMDS2NT8MFXA5","A3V1NALMIKQT29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1NALMIKQT29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a reasonable priced facial cleanser system, you can look no further. This facial brush cleaning system comes with five different interchangeable heads. The heads are easy to change, without resistance. It has two different speeds. You can use the different speed settings with each of the five heads. I do prefer to use the higher speed setting, I feel like this product works best on the high setting. I would imagine that the lower speed would be great for young ladies who are just starting a new beauty routine, and who are just learning to use different beauty tools. I have used the brush head the most since I received my cleansing system, and I am happy with the results. My face is a lot cleaner using this facial brush than when I just use a plain washcloth. Since this is such a great value for the money, it makes it perfect to travel with. We are planning a camping trip in the next two weeks and since this runs on batteries, I am going to take it with me. This whole system including attachments can fit inside a small, zipped make-up bag. This would be a perfect gift for all the young ladies moving into dorms when college starts.

"Shhhh, I have a new sexy little secret! The lipstick tube that I carry in my purse, isn't wearable lipstick. I have had the most fun teasing my husband with this adult novelty toy. When this item arrived, discretely packaged, I inserted one AAA (not included), and showed it to my husband. We both were surprised how realistic it looked. I also gave him a short demo of how it worked, and we both ended up with a smile on our faces. Okay back to the teasing part of my review.  We were recently at a cocktail party, and almost every time he would look at me from across the room, I would reach down into my clutch bag, and pull out my ""lipstick""! I would continue the fun by taking the cap of the adult novelty lipstick toy off, and act as though I was touching up my make-up. You should have seen the look on his face, or should I say the shade of red on his face. HA! HA! I continued to tease all through out the cocktail party. We would both giggle each time I ""applied my lipstick"". We didn't even make it home that night, before using the item for it's intended purpose. That night is now one of my most memorable cocktail parties. The chances for spontaneous play are endless with this great item. The fun doesn't stop with the discreet design. The tip of the lipstick has some purpose when it comes to adult play. I the way the soft tip lays on my love button. Warning, this little secret makes more vibration than you would expect. If you decide to step out of your comfort zone, and use this novelty outside of your home, you can easily clean it up with some soap and water. You do yourself or even a friend a favor, and put this one in your cart. I think I will purchase more of these to give to some of my girlfriends as a gift.

"Meet one of my newest Pink B.O.B additions to my collection. Like their other vibe products, they have given this vibe a male male name. Let me introduce you to ""Devon""! Devon is a small 4.13"" Length, 1.88"" Diameter, and 3.5"" Internal length. The Devon vibe is a great one to take along when you are traveling. It can easily fit inside your purse without being noticed. I usually don't ""show off"" vibes in my collection, but the different colored bling, which mimics small jewels, has me wanting to show off Devon to all my girlfriends. This is the first vibe I have personally seen, that has some ""style""! There is no need to be concerned with the bling addition, because they are attached securely at the base. This is the perfect vibe to entertain your love button. You will reach your ""destination"" with Devon, because of the different adjustable vibration speeds this toy has built in. You can easily adjust these speeds at the bottom of the shaft, with a turn of the base. This vibe is made from a smooth silicone, which makes it great for inner or outer sensations. If you happen to be a male reading this and you want to introduce some play into your love life, I would suggest this one. Every woman loves some bling! This would also be a great addition to a baclorette party! It is perfectly priced too! I love having Devon around, and I am sure lots of other women, would also love this one! I received this product at an discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S40H3MIH9UDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZJL3LQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S40H3MIH9UDW","A3V1NALMIKQT29","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1NALMIKQT29?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not many people would consider paying $35 for coasters, but if you're in the market seriously consider Decasso's coasters. Every detail on this set is perfect. Even the felt on the bottom is top quality. The leather is definitely high quality top grain leather. The holder is beautiful in it's simplicity. The leather on the holder is sewn where the leather is folded over (front opening and top edge). You can't see stitching in the pictures (black thread).To protect these from moisture, I used some Melatonin shoe waterproofing spray I had. Worked great at sealing them.The color in the picture is accurate. It is a dark charcoal gray (black).Amazon's price was by far the best I could find on the net.

"I bought this to use as a pre-filter for 3 Winix Hepa air purifier(2ea WAC5300 and 1ea WAC5500. Winix PlasmaWave 5300 Air Cleaner Model, Winix WAC5500 True HEPA Air Cleaner with PlasmaWave TechnologyI have had this pre-filter for about 2 months now:I bought one first to check the quality and thickness and durability.These are thick enough so you can't see light through them and it seems to trap about 95% of the visible dust which keeps the carbon pre-filter clean much longer.I use a vacuum cleaner to clean the dust off this filter which works very well. My vacuum has strong suction and really pulls hard and stretches this filter. The filter takes this punishment very well and doesn't lose it's shape.I have since bought 2 more for my two other two air purifiers. This pre-filter should extend the life of the expensive Hepa filter which cost $65+.Very happy with this product.All the positive reviews were right on - Thanks.[...] Thanks","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UTBXGCTUPII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GKC2US#wasThisHelpful","R34UTBXGCTUPII","A34ZS78ACD3D7Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not buy this from Amazon because they were charging $199 and here in Texas Amazon has to charge 6.25% sales tax. I bought this one on Ebay for $185 free shipping.WAC5300 $159 vs WAC5500 $199. I have 2 WAC5300's and 1 WAC5500.WAC55001) This model does come with a remote. The remote is very useful turning it on and changing fan speeds. It is the only way to turn off the plasma wave.2) Washable Hepa filter. I have serious doubts that you can effectively wash a Hepa filter. There are no instructions for cleaning it either.3) External color4) On fan speed #2 this unit (5500) is quieterI have had this air purifier for 2 months now. It works great for us. I use it mostly on the 2nd lowest speed #2. The air in the bedroom where I use this one is always very fresh now. This model is a little quieter than the 5300. Both my 5300's you can hear the motor making a faint whining sound on speed #2 only. The 5500 does not make this sound making it best for the bedroom.I bought this primarily for:1) cleaning the air of out-gassing from plastics/synthetics, paint, particle board, carpet etc.2) No one in the family has any allergies, but I was interested in lowering the pollen, mold spores and dust especially in spring and summer when we all get runny noses from time to time.3) I have a 5yr old son and want to keep the indoor air as clean as possible for his health.IT WORKS FOR DETECTING AND CLEANING PLASTIC/SYNTHETICS OUT-GASSING:I bought a memory foam topper to soften up a hard mattress and it feels great. However there were many complaints about chemical smell and that it needs a few days to air out before using. When I received it, I noticed a minor smell but used it that night since I am not sensitive to the odor.  (2.5"" Lucid by LinenSpa Gel Infused Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper with Removable Bamboo Cover, QUEEN)****This product detected the new mattress odor the 1st night and and while on auto kicked into #3 fan speed for about 45min. The air quality meter was at 4 bars of 5 and gradually declined to ""good air quality"". This continued for several days even though I couldn't smell it anymore.**** I smoke outside (never inside) and both models occasionally detect the small amount of smoke left in my lungs when I come in the house. This truly surprised me.For LIGHT SLEEPERS like me:For use in the bedroom I use a timer to shut the unit off between 4am and 5am when I am most likely to wake up from fan noise. The unit is very quiet at speed 1). Speed 2) is also quiet but can wake me up at around 5am. The timer I use is Belkin Conserve Energy Saving Outlet. It can be set for 30 min, 3 hours and 6 hours. So, I set it for 6 hours and turn it on at 10pm. It shuts off the air cleaner at 4am. Perfect for me.Power consumption by fan speed:Off 1.3WAuto) 5W1) 5W2) 15W3) 38W4) Turbo 77WFan noise:1) Very difficult to hear in a very quiet room at night.2) Minor white noise, fine for daytime use but may be too noisy for light sleepers.3) Sound kicks up a few notches, fine for brief periods but too much for all day use.4 Turbo loudPlasma Wave noise:None. I can only hear something when the fan is on #1 low and I listen at the air outlet vent.My modifications:Surprisingly these all fit1) I added a second charcoal filter to increase the effectiveness of cleaning odor and synthetics out-gassing. Carbon filters are VERY IMPORTANT to cleanse the air of very small pollutants. Pollutants too small for the HEPA filter to catch. Change the carbon more often than 3 months. You can buy cut to fit ACTIVATED CARBON filters here on Amazon for 7-10$ for 2.2) I bought a washable pre-filter to keep dust from blocking the charcoal's cleaning and extend the life of the Hepa filter. This prefilter is a little narrow on the width by 1/4"" but works well Duck Brand 1285234 24-Inch by 15-Inch by 1/4-Inch Foam Air Conditioner FilterCharcoal filter vs Activated carbon:They have similar cleaning abilities but Activated Carbon is many times more effective than charcoal or carbon. For those that want to know, here is why: Activated carbon is processed carbon or charcoal. It is processed with steam to create millions microscopic holes and channels that trap the sub micron particles that pollute your air and that can't be cleaned by the hepa filter. Activated carbon is used commercially to purify air and drinking water. I will be replacing the charcoal filter with Activated carbon filter. Cut-to-fit Carbon for Air PurifiersAir quality sensor:I was skeptical about the air quality sensor but it has detected some cooking odors and plastic out-gassing so far.My only concern is how long will it work and I seriously doubt it will detect everything. Most sensors need some maintenance (more than the vacuuming recommended in the manual). ****But maybe it's not important in the long run as you become confident the air cleaner works and you change the carbon filters at the recommended 3 months or sooner.A little about me: I am a practicing Electronic Engineer with over 20 yrs experience analyzing electronic components and engineering modifications to improve performance or fix defects.The price performance of this product is very good. I rate it 5 stars.Thank you to all the reviewers of this product and other air purifiers sold on Amazon. You have helped me make a good choice in the $200 price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORX2XN22KNCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WT39QW#wasThisHelpful","R2ORX2XN22KNCK","A34ZS78ACD3D7Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had problems with insomnia for many years. I went to sleep specialists and the best they could offer was various prescriptions. I eventually settled on taking klonopin 1mg before bed. This did help but was not a cure.A few years ago with the help of the web to do research I found several things that help and many that do nothing (for me):L-Theanine 200mg in the morning with coffee - makes me feel rested nearly all day. I stopped needing coffee in the early afternoon. Greatly reduced occasional mild to moderate anxiety. I feel great all day even if I did not get enough sleep.Nutraspray melatonin - 1 spray (1.5mg) usually puts me to sleep in 20 minutes. I've been using this for several months and it's effectiveness has not declined. (I've tried melatonin caps before and they did not help) This does not help me get back to sleep if I wake up after 5 hours.5 HTP- Tried this a few years ago and it worked for a while until I started have wild dreams and had to stop taking it. I kept the bottle. I recently started taking 5HTP again but only took 1/4 (25mg) capsule and that worked great. Helps me sleep the entire night without the wild dreams.Mucuna Dopa- Does seem to help sleep through the night although I do not take it every night and take only 1/4 cap or 25mg.I've written this review to give fellow insomniacs some ideas and to encourage you not to give up trying to find a non pharmaceutical treatment for sleep disorders.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5NQMP306D73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PPTW3W#wasThisHelpful","R3H5NQMP306D73","A34ZS78ACD3D7Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary first:I received the gray. An excellent color with aluminum accents. I think it looks better in person than in the pictures.The base is plastic with metal inside and heavy enough for stability. The lamp is made of good quality plastic and some metal. Overall solid quality construction. The LED's are recessed in the thin lamp arm section so they don't shine in your eyes. The diffuser works well and evenly lights work area with no glare. Power consumption is very low at 8.4W on max brightness. The lamp is just barely warm after hours of use. Lamp control is by touch button similar to a touch screen on a smartphone. Touch button is lighted when off. There is no separate on/off button.I love this lamp and would not hesitate to buy it again. The longer I have it the more I like it.Light output: Max 500 lumen. For comparison 400 Lumens= 40W incandescent and 800 Lumens= 60W incandescent. Keep in mind that this lamps light is reflected down so it will appear to put out more light.Dimming: 3 levels. No separate on/off, so you have to cycle down from high, med, low to off. No big deal for me. Touch control works well similar to a smart phone touch screen.Light color: Halfway between warm white and bright white on the color spectrum. A good choice in my opinion. Not too white like office fluorescent lighting.Light diffuser: Works well. You can easily see the individual LED's looking directly at them, but the lamp diffuser evenly lights your desk or work area. The LED lamp arm swivels about 15 degrees.Adjustability of lamp:1) BASE swivels only 45 degrees left or right. 90 degrees or more would be much better, but not a deal breaker for me.2) VERTICAL arm adjusts nearly flat front or back. (almost 90 degrees forward and almost 90 degrees backwards.3) LAMP ARM will fold down flush with the vertical arm and 45 degrees higher than horizontal. Sorry if that description is confusing.4) LAMP ARM TILT is only about 15 degrees. This is enough tilt to keep the lamp from shining in your eyes.Note: The lamp joint(s) do creek a little when brand new. This does not last long.LED life:You should NEVER have to replace any of the LED's. They are made of silicon. The same stuff as your computer microprocessors are made from (Intel) though the manufacturing process is much different. The built in power supply is much more likely to fail before any of the LED's.Note: Not this model, but some models from this company have an AC adapter (110V-220V) that can be replaced if it goes bad.

Still a good value at less than $100 considering the LED's will last a very long time, good light color, 3 light levels and excellent construction, materials and very low power consumption.I also have the Prism TLC-4300BK (more expensive) that has 3 light color option and a few extra features.

"I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE WRITING A REVIEW FOR FISH OIL SUPPLEMENTS.I started taking these in JUNE 2012 while going through a divorce and an expensive, stressful custody battle for my son (I am the father).Somewhere I read that fish oil supplements can help with excessive stress, anxiety, fatigue etc.These fish oil caps helped me keep a clear head while not getting enough sleep for MANY MONTHS. I was amazed how effective this product was FOR ME. With the help of a great lawyer and this product my custody battle results turned out very well.When my wife was pregnant her doctor recommended taking fish oil supplements. Well my boy is 5 years old now. He is very healthy and smart. So, the medical community believes there is something to be gained for the growing fetus.Fish taste: Some if you don't take these at the beginning or halfway through a meal. I actually am glad there is a fish taste, because that means the fish oil is unlikely to be over-processed.Fish Burps: Yes, sometimes. None if you take them at the beginning of a meal and/or empty stomach.Large capsule: True, but they slide down my throat without water. Very easy to swallow.I continue to take these daily and always keep extra stock on hand.Price is good: at the recommended 2 per day the 120 count bottle will last 2 months at $22-$25 per bottle.

"I would have never bought or looked for a set like this because most sets are missing too many sizes to be useful.I saw this in the gold box special and was surprised at the assortment at a reasonable price.QUALITY: Not the best and not the lowest quality. I feel this set is a reasonable comprise of quality vs price.This set is fairly complete for most jobs around the house or car. It doesn't have it all, but comes close. Surprisingly good set of bits including torx and hex bits.See my photos.CONVENIENT: The reason I bought this.I already have a good collection of higher quality tools, but many jobs I do require a few extra trips to the tool box because I got the wrong size or forgot something.**This is my go to first tool set now for around the house repairs. This set is good enough to do most car repairs and would be great to keep in the trunk.CASE:Reasonably good but does have potential issues other reviewers mentioned. Case is made of blow molded plastic which is bound to have some problems with regular use. (Blow molded plastic is soft and often thin) All my tools stay in their slots so far. Latches are molded into the case and will eventually break with use. I do expect this case to last a long time with reasonable care. Case looks good to.Again a reasonable compromise of quality vs price.WEIGHT: The set is heavy at 18 pounds, but that is expected with so many tools.See my close up photo's of each section.This set won't let you do everything, but will come close. One reviewer said all you will need to add is a hammer and drill. And another comment: 90% of the tools 90% of the time. Great comments and I agree with both.Very happy with this set. Now I have one set I can grab for my do it yourself jobs and only occasionally go to my tool box(S) for the odd size or specialty tool.If this review was helpful to you, please click ""yes"".

"As other reviewer have said and I agree ""the quality is reasonably good for the price"".I bought this safety vest primarily for roadside emergencies. The area I live in does not have shoulders to pull over should I get a flat or other mechanical problem..a)Made of a lightweight synthetic mesh with decent quality nylon zipper. (Left hand zip takes some getting used to.)b)Highly reflective/visible day or night. Very bright yellow/green. Seems to glow in daylight.b)Size: I normally wear medium. Medium in this vest fits my SLIM frame well with a T-shirt on.d)get a larger size for winter, so it fits over your winter jacket.e)The medium is probably good for most ladies with or without a jacket. The medium I bought will be for my wife and the new large I have just ordered will be for me.Note sure how these would hold up with everyday use in a work environment. See other reviews.Happy with the purchase-I feel I paid a reasonably good price for the quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GT0K97NFJ1YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VKWQBC#wasThisHelpful","R1GT0K97NFJ1YO","A34ZS78ACD3D7Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used ozone industrial machines like this for many years to clean the air in my house or apt.Most of you may have read that your house or apt is polluted from chemicals emanating from paint, furniture, carpet etc.Ozone:a) Kills bacteria, viruses, mold spores etc.b) Destroys (oxidizes) ALL odors, not just cover up the smellc) Destroys (oxidizes) all chemical fumes from paint to formaldehyde that pollute your house.About the unit:a) comes with 3 plates. This unit puts out enough ozone with one plate installed. I save the other 2 plates for replacements. I use this in a 700sq ft apt.b) The plates deteriorate with use because nitric acid forms on the plates in a humid environment. The plates can be cleaned but the acid will still eat away at the metal grid on the plates. So, the extra 2 plates you have can extend the life of the unit. You can also buy replacement plates on Amazon.c) I never need to turn this on for more than 20 minutes. Note: It has a 60 min timer with a hold function.About ozone: Ozone is oxygen that has been converted from naturally occurring 02 into 03.03 is highly reactive. 03 (ozone) recombines into 02 in a relatively short time.a) Ozone is a powerful oxidizer. It kills bacteria, viruses etc by eating away the outer shell. Once the outer shell is damaged the bacteria/virus dies. UV kills bacteria and viruses by damaging the DNA. Not as effective as ozone.b) Ozone is not healthy to breath, so set your timer when everyone will be out of the house for more than an hour.C) You can sanitize your central air and heating system by turning on the fan only while the ozone machine is on.Ozone vs Electrostatic air cleaners.a) Electrostatic air cleaners do produce a small amount of ozone that does freshen the air, but their main purpose is to remove particles from the air. I have owned several and they are difficult to clean and become unusable after about a years use.b) Ozone produced in higher concentrations will kill or neutralize pollen, bacteria, viruses, mold spores and odors from any source. Note: if the source of odors is not removed the odors will come back. (cat box, rotting trash etc)I know this is a lot more info than most of you want or need to know.Summary: Ozone and machines like this are the most effective way to clean and sanitize the  air in your house. It will not damage the finish on any of your possessions.Update and Reminder: OZONE IS A POWERFUL OXIDIZER. Ozone is not healthy AND VERY DANGEROUS TO BREATH AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS and UNHEALTHY TO BREATH AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. So set your timer when everyone will be out of the house for at least one hour or more.Paid $145 May 2012. Sold by Homeland Goods Fulfilled by Amazon.Jan 2013 (6 months) still working perfectly.

"Truthfully I don't understand some of the negative reviews.a) These lights are cheap enough where if you lose or break it, you won't be upset.b) I have 3 of these now. I have no problems with the magnets falling off. If they do, I will glue back on.c) I keep a few of these in my car for emergency lighting, and one in the house.d) There are more expensive work/emergency lights with more features but they cost a lot more.e) This light is relatively small so it is easy to store and will fit in your pocket, but not for EDC.f) Light output is acceptable but not really bright. They use low cost LED's. But again you don't need the expensive state of the art LED's that you find in expensive flashlights.g) To replace the batteries you do need to remove 3 Philips screws.

"I received the watch 1 week ago: Amazon's packaging was very professional. The Tag box is as handsome as the watch. Everything included was high quality.The watch is exactly what I wanted and is described well in pictures and features table..The watch is relatively thin at 10mm compared to other watches with more features that are 13mm to 15mm thick. The diameter at 39mm is a good fit for most wrists as it does not appear large or oversized in any way.Rubber wrist band is very good quality. Forms readily to my wrist. The band does require trimming to your size. There are no instructions in the manual, but it is not difficult to figure out.Sapphire crystal is very hard. Very difficult to scratch. According to Wikipedia the only thing that can scratch it is a diamond.The watch does have some weight to it, but the rubber band distributes the weight well. As I move my arm during the day, the watch stays upright at the top of my wrist even though I still have the band a little loose.Trimming the band: you have to cut the band to size. The backside of the band has grooves. The spacing of the grooves are relatively small and you should cut along a groove. Be careful when you get close to your size because one grove makes a surprising difference. The upside is the watch band will fit perfectly.The overall look of the watch is very handsome. I does not look flashy at all.Beautifully crafted watch at a very good price. Would not hesitate to buy it or another expensive watch from Amazon again.Note:Ships from and sold by Amazon.com6 week update: The watch is very accurate. It has kept time to 1 second compared with 2 radio updated clocks. It has become even more comfortable as the rubber wrist band forms to your wrist(takes only a few days). At 6weeks now, the longer I have this watch the more I like it. It is very high quality, excellent workmanship. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. ha ha9 month update 11-25-12 watch keeps time perfectly.

"I was pleasantly surprised at the overall good quality of everything in this package.a)The drive enclosure is well made and fits the 2.5"" (laptop) drive perfectly. Power switch is a good feature, so you can turn off power before moving/disconecting drive.b) Includes screws and screwdriver to attach to drive to holder.c) Well made USB cable. Requires to 2 USB ports. The 2nd port is for extra power. One of the USB plugs has a pass through so you only need one open port on your pc.d) Comes with a very nice padded case for drive holder only. Would have been nice to add a place for the cables as well. The case has a magnetic closure. Magnets will erase  magnetic media like harddrives but probably is ok since the case covers are metal(steel) which will shield the drive. The magnet is not powerful either.e) The product box is very good quality and is great for storing drive and cables between uses. Everything fits inside easilyf) Using the drive the 1st time was easy. Windows 7 recognized the drive and installed drivers automatically.g) The case becomes warm after backing up entire system (30min). About 30min to backup 40gig.. Not bad for USB 2.0. Back up did not slow down my system at all, so I could continue my work.h)Includes mini CD with instructions and drivers for older versions of windows and Mac's.There are other drive holders on Amazon for about $8 on up.

"I tried Tufoil many years ago after reading about it in popular mechanics. Then, my Nissan pick-up was making loud valve tappet rattling noise ONLY in the morning for a few seconds. I put some tufoil in it and by the 3rd day the morning rattling was gone. Never came back.Next vehicle was a Toyota pick-up turbo 5 spd manual... The 1st gear was very tight. Many times at a stop light I had to put it in reverse to roll it slightly to get it into 1st gear. I knew Tufoil would help but it was a pain to get to the manual transmission oil filler hole, but I eventually did it. It took about a month to see some improvemnet, but it did gradually get better until it was very easy shifting.I have put this in new cars after the break-in and ran them years until I sold them private party. Always got top dollar partly because the engine sounded so good. I am still using it.I just bought an Infinity G25 and added it after the break-in was complete (6,000 miles) I put in my lawn mower and air compressor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"I've been shopping for a fire (security) safe for months now and until now couldn't find one that had relatively good reviews and at a reasonably price.We've all read the other reviews and I agree and confirm most everything. It arrived in perfect condition by UPS. Paint finish is quite good and has a thin oily residue. The interior was clean, and the caulking around plastic interior and steel case was applied well. The shelf is thin and sags readily with any weight (My documents will be on this shelf.) The plastic combo dial works well and has loud clicks. Numbers are easy to see in low light. The key lock is nice for extra security should someone learn your combo. Exterior hinge? Not the best idea. The door inside has a pocket that fits a small frame pistol such as a 380.To in icrease weight: On the bottom of the safe I put about 20 boxes of 40cal ammo. In addition I will keep 5 handguns and some valuables. This adds at least 50lbs+. Now it's VERY difficult to move.I have no illusions that these safes will protect valuables from a determined thief. Safes actually would be one of the first things a thief would want because valuables are normally concentrated there. My safe will be a DECOY and have documents, passports and a few handguns. Other valuables (emergency cash, gold, expensive coins) will be stashed elsewhere inconspicuously out of sight.Hope this helps you.Note: Once the safe is opened it can be locked and unlocked with the key only as long as the combo dial isn't turned. You need to turn the combo dial to relock it completely.Note 2-27-13 (1 year): I use Eva-dry Renewable E-333 Wireless Mini Dehumidifer to keep the safe dry for a year now. The safe must be reasonably well sealed, One of these keeps my save very dry at < 40% relative humudity.I am quite happy with the purchase. Thanks to all of you that reviewed this and other safes.Note:Ships from and sold by Amazon.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX9882MWNZVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P12F2K#wasThisHelpful","R2CX9882MWNZVE","A34ZS78ACD3D7Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZS78ACD3D7Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shirt is made from lightweight quality material perfect for warm to hot weather. Construction quality and detail is excellent. The fit is just a little large, but just enough for breathing room when it's hot outside. I now both have gray and navy. Both good colors.

"I really like this knife! Cost me almost 70 bucks from Amazon. It feels like a big steak knife more than an outdoor knife... this isn't necessarily bad though. It is the small brother of the Camp Knife. It comes with an extra set of coyote brown scales and a very nice desert colored cordura sheath. The first thing that strikes me is the light feel and smallish size. Speced at .4lbs including the sheath I believe. The blade is thinner than the .165"" thick handle tang and has a thin tapering flat grind which is clipped almost the full length of the blade. Thumb jimping was placed in the perfect spot for my hand. After removing the scales I found 2 large cutouts between the bolt holes. Seems like this was needed for balance and weight reduction which is good but I don't classify this as full tang as the advertising states. It's a great medium/light duty outdoor knife. The blade, especially the thin tip has a delicate feel to it.The handle scales were very smartly designed and feel excellent in every hand hold position including being choked up on the choil. They are not totally slick and provide okay grip IMHO.  The brown scales really make this knife pop! Very handsome. The edge came crazy sharp out of the box... be careful! The grind is perfectly done also. No flaws. The blade coating is nicely done and should hold up as good as any. The sheath is well made with lots of extras including mounting options. There are lots of straps, loops, snaps and even eyelets for leg tie or a handle retention cord. The velcro pouch is noisy but very effective.The BK 15 makes a great camp knife and could handle light fire making and bushcraft tasks but you need to be mindful of the laws of physics when putting this thin blade to task. Recommended!I will update after a few more months of use.Update: 30 May 2013After typical use (no abuse) as a camp/outdoor knife I still like it. The look, feel, comfort and cutting ability are all above average. Love using it choked up on the choil. It is not as efficient shaving and feathersticking as a pure scandi grind but is excellent for a flat ground blade. The coating holds up very well but you can feel the resistance when cutting chunks of wood bigger than shavings. After some use the coating does begin to smooth out a bit. I only batoned small pieces of wood... nothing bigger than 2"". It chops small jobs just fine... the sharp holding edge is to thank for this as the knife is very light. No rust even after a rainy overnighter. Still recommended!Please comment and join the great discussions concerning this knife!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LKSNRH6O3JIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073GZQRQ#wasThisHelpful","R3LKSNRH6O3JIH","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who would've thunk that a dishwasher utensil basket could change your life. For years I struggled to keep the old Maytag basket together with tie straps and wire but my fork kept finding its way through the bottom no matter what I did. Having to fish it out of the bottom of the machine frightened my fork and hurt my back. Maytag would gladly sell me a replacement but I felt getting a loan for this item would be silly... very expensive for another piece of junk. So, as usual, I turned to Amazon for help and they delivered... literally!This basket fits anywhere because it splits in half and can be hung on any available rail. I keep one half by the sink to load dirty silverware while my clean stuff waits for my selection from inside the washer. It seems durable and well made. Both halves have simple, sturdy covers that remove easily and the inside dividers are flow through for improved washing/scrubbing action. What a great idea at a great price! Now my fork rests comfortably and securely in place while being showered with warm, lathery water then awaits my return to select it once again.Recommended!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U4V97D3RMIZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TIZKIY#wasThisHelpful","R1U4V97D3RMIZG","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the money I like this knife. It seems that Taylor Brands has made some changes in the steel they use and sheath design. This particular knife used to be 440c and now it is shown to be 7Cr17 according to S&W catalogs. 7Cr17 is a Chinese 440a. My knife has no steel designation on it but has some 440c characteristics. Since it has the new style sheath it must be the 440a which is fine with me. The older sheath was heavier because of a larger hard plastic insert, metal fasteners and D ring. The newer sheath is much lighter but comes with a better pouch and molle system. I have several S&W knives with both sheath designs and I like them both for different applications. I was hoping to receive the old style with this knife.The knife and sheath arrived new and in serviceable condition. It has a sturdy feel due to the full length tang and well attached butt cap, handle and guard... nothing is loose. I do want to note that the guard is not fastened to the tang in any way but held tight by the pressure of the handle pushing it against the blade. The aluminum butt cap is firmly attached to the tang by an aluminum pin which holds it all together. The rat tang is cut at a 90 degree angle where it goes through the guard. You begin to get the picture here. This is a solid knife but if abused too much the tang can snap off at the guard... this is the weakest point.The tanto blade is a strong design with plenty of steel at the tip. There is a slight swedge at the front end of the spine but not enough to make it delicate. The grind starts at just over 50% of the width of the blade which adds to the edge strength and gives you a nice strong flat at the spine which is ideal if you need to fasten it to your bench sharpener. The grind is flat with a secondary bevel of about 25 degrees (could be more) at the cutting edge... strong, strong edge! It came utility sharp and responded well to my Lansky ceramic rod for a smooth paper cutting edge... no problem here. The sandpaper like blade coating sticks well but will wear with use. Stainless doesn't usually need to be coated but the extra protection doesn't hurt. Some question this but the main reason for the coating is to be in sync with the tactical design. The coating can be removed easily with any number of products from your hardware store.This knife was designed for tactical purposes and is a copy cat of many other famous fighting knives. If carried for this reason and medium utility use, it should last a lifetime. Some like to use it for outdoor/bushcraft activities and will chop with or baton this knife... take caution and remember the weak spot I mentioned earlier!! I would recommend light batoning and chopping only... use common sense here! You can not overcome the law of physics! I would not hammer nails or anything very hard with the aluminum butt cap/pommel. Tent pegs... yes. Why? Well, it's aluminum. You see, the purpose of this pommel design is for tactical grip. Something to keep your hand from slipping off the end when pulling the knife out of what ever you stuck it in... tanto points are made for stabbing/penetrating. The pommel can also be used as a nonlethal striker. The handle is grippy and simply designed to accommodate different tactical grips such as the reverse grip. If you have large hands you may find the grip a bit small though. There is a decent sized unsharpened part of the knife after the guard (ricasso) that you can choke up on for utility use. You will have to reach your thumb over or around the guard to rest it on the blade spine. The upper guard could be ground off to make this grip easier.The new style sheath holds the knife fine enough and has a velcro belt loop system so you don't have to remove your belt. They added a small diamond sharpener in the pouch... it works. Here is a tip if your guard or butt cap ever loosen up over time. Take some 6 pound mono-filament, color of your choice, and wedge it in between guard and rubber handle and start wrapping until tight then tie ends together. Seal the gap with black nail polish or anything else black that will do the job... be creative. I have done this to many knives... problem solved! Good luck and enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WBDMTBFDUXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UUV1J4#wasThisHelpful","R13WBDMTBFDUXF","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up from Amazon when it was down to 34 bucks. Then I watched it go down to about 28 bucks... a steal in this price range. 50 bucks may be a bit much for this selection though. Anyway, I like what I got! I've had it for a few months and have been batoning wood for the fire. It has held up like a champ. The hard zytel handles did loosen up from the impacts and I had to apply Loctite... problem solved. Grip is fairly comfy but I think I would have preferred a softer Kraton or hard rubber. I did slip a ranger band over the handle grips which solved this problem. Oh, the steel is one solid piece when the scales are removed... a true full tang! The 1070 steel came crazy sharp and will dull after a while but touch up is a snap with a ceramic rod. The blade coating is extremely durable and without a scratch after propelling it through hardwood logs 40-50 times or so, including knots... impressive! While stuck in the knots I could see a bend in the blade but it always came out unscathed. This is a tough knife but not a behemoth so proper caution is needed during hard use... any knife can break when taken past its limits. Don't worry, mine is still intact and I didn't mind testing it for you! The Full flat grind is very nice but is a bit thin towards the edge so it should be handled accordingly.The sheath is fine and holds the knife. It's typical light weight nylon with plastic insert. The survival gadgets are better than nothing and work okay. Not high quality of course but nice for the money. In all this is an acceptable knife and with proper use and care should last a lifetime or more. Recommended!Update 13 March 2014:No problems with this knife after much hard use.

"I really like this knife. It looks like something my grandpa used to pull out of his pocket 40 years ago. Simple, nostalgic and useful. The quality is very good. The blade fits tight between the brass liners and opens and closes with a snap... no blade play. The grind is fine and it came utility sharp. The celluloid handle material was first developed in the mid 1800's if you can believe that. It's a softer, flammable plastic material that replaced the use of real ivory and was used to make hair clips, buttons, pens, dolls and of course... knife handles. The softer plastic provides better grip than the newer thermoplastics which is a plus for me. I love the yellow color. This sturdy pocket knife should last a lifetime. I guess grandpa knew a thing or two! If you're old like me you'll know what I'm talking about.Why spend 500% more for other similar name brands when this will do the job just fine.

"I'm very impressed with this knife. Beautiful, elegant and fluid lines. Very easy and quick in and out of the pocket. Jimped Flipper deploys the blade effortlessly without flicking the wrist and locks up solid. The blade rides between a bronze and nylon washer with two ball bearings to provide a smooth pivot. Good retention when closed. Came very sharp, comfortable in the hand and not too heavy but still feels sturdy. The blue steel pocket clip and skeletonized liners are very attractive. The black and blue micarta is good looking and although the finish is smooth it still provides some grip... good enough for emergency tactical use along with the guard provided by the flipper. Another 1/4"" of jimping further up the blade would add to the grip. The pocket clip is perfect and holds well without tearing your pants apart. A real winner from Mr. McGinnis...

" 3:23 MinsThis little gem is a great utility knife that can skin, bushcraft and campcraft. The hollow grind, drop point blade is 3.5"" long with a 3.25"" cutting edge. ** WARNING ** It came razor sharp out of the box! The plastic handle has rubber inlays which makes it extremely grippy and comfy.But the real cool feature is the one handed release, roller locking plastic sheath. The spring mounted roller rides up the ricasso and locks into the finger grove when fully inserted. It will not accidentally come out! A push on the edge of the sheath with your thumb pops it loose with just one hand.The sheath has a nice horizontal drain hole which can accommodate a lanyard for a neck knife hang. One handed release also allows for belt, pack or boot mount.The knife and sheath weigh next to nothing and the cost isn't far behind.

"Got this on sale for 8 bucks and am very pleased. The rubber handle is the first thing you notice after removing it from the nifty box... this thing is grippy, grippy, grippy and very comfy. Mine is colored a deep forest green and looks nice. Lanyard hole with brass liner included! It is very light certainly not much more than 5 ounces.The steel is advertised as 400 series and seems to be some type of 440, could be A, B or C but I haven't done the research yet. The blade is an upswept drop point with a nice flat spine that maintains it's thickness almost to the point. The grain is very fine and almost looks like another stainless I have with vanadium in it. **WARNING** the edge is danger sharp and cuts paper with ease right out of the box! The grind is a slightly hollow half grind with a slight secondary bevel... great for skinning, fish cleaning and bushcraft. It's 1/8"" thick (thicker than a standard Mora) so it takes an easy edge but thick enough for moderate tough duty. The blade is 4.25"" long with a 3.75"" cutting edge and 1.2"" wide. The handle is 4.75"" long for a 9"" total length not 9.5"" as advertised here. It has a thumb depression instead of jimping which is fine and you can choke up on the ricasso by placing your index finger forward of the handle. My magnet sticks to the handle all the way around so it's a full length tang... even past the lanyard hole.I think the sheath is fine. The braided nylon has a cool look to it and is well stitched. It has a solid plastic insert that extends to the bottom with drain holes. The brass insert at the bottom is secure and could be hung as a neck knife... the knife will not fall out after the brass snap is secured. The best feature is that the knife can be inserted either way so if you're a lefty this set up will work for you!Hey, this is a smart buy for the budget minded who need a versatile knife...

"This is a nifty little tool with excellent size and weight. Not a heavy, hard use item like the larger, more expensive popular brand of multitools but certainly comparable to some of the basic swiss selections. Complete with grippy scales and orange accents like the rest of the BG line up. It rides comfortably in any pocket and the blade and tools open and close easily while maintaining a solid feel. The knife came paper cutting sharp right out of the package! I can't see how the blade can possibly catch on the liner as another reviewer mentioned... it's just not possible unless the tool has been damaged in some way. The liner is completely covered and inside the grip on my tool. This sturdy pocket tool is a great value at 10 bucks and comes with the obligatory survival guide. Another good selection from Gerber and BG.Update 11 Aug 2012:This tool is still solid even after some hard use. Everything stays tight even after loosening some stuck screws. The blade is easy to maintain and takes a razor edge. I find myself using it more than my slick plastic handled swiss tool as the grips on this knife make it more comfortable and sure. Others have complained that the tools are hard to open... they are tougher to get out than a swiss tool but it's really not that difficult. I have noticed that it gets easier the more I use it. Not sure if this is due to breaking it in or just getting used to it... but it does get easier! The best part is, once open, it is very very sturdy. This is what I want in a tool.

"WOW! What a little powerhouse. Finally a light that comes on the low setting before high. Here's how it works: The first full switch depression is low, the next full depression is off, the next is high and then off again. A few seconds after the light is off it always comes on in the low mode. The neat thing is that once it is on you can switch back and forth from high to low with only a half switch depression... this is really cool. Unfortunately you can't turn the light on with a half depression when it is off... you know, like a tactical momentary switch.The build quality is impeccable along with the pocket clip, key chain ring and lanyard. The housing is solid and feels like a fine instrument of light. The spot is nice and white with good, even spill light. No dark spots or goofy looking rings with this tool. I found it at a local discount store for 13 bucks... I thought that was a steal.

" 4:33 MinsThis is the Best of the BG offerings. Most retailers sell it for 30 bucks which is a bit much but when I found it on sale for 19 bucks my cat like reflexes took over. This knife is no toy. Its very sturdy with no blade play and has a good solid feel... I was pleasantly surprised with how tuff this thing realy is. It will make a great back up to your fixed blade survival selection. The handle is fantastic and very grippy even when wet. The rubberized grip absorbs impact and sticks to your hand. It fits VERY nicely in the hand and feels like an extension of it. With a dual thumb stud it opens easily, locks into place with a confident ""SNAP"" of the lock back and securely closes for safety. You will not feel ""under knifed"" with this thing.The thick but not too heavy high carbon steel blade is half serrated and comes very sharp. Love Gerbers serrations... great for cutting rope, cordage and strapping. Lots of so called knife experts reject Gerber's steel but I find it tough, dependable and easy to sharpen. The serrations cut paper better than the straight edge portion... they are danger sharp!I like the orange accents on this type of knife... makes it easier to find in a hurry which makes sense since that's what it's for. The nylon sheath is excellent. Don't forget to melt any frayed ends with your lighter... this will help it to last longer and look great. Even comes with survival instructions that seem to be printed on moisture resistant paper. A fine knife... good job Bear and Gerber.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26X2DFIQXZRZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IE3ZPK#wasThisHelpful","R26X2DFIQXZRZD","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:23 MinsThis little gem is a great utility knife that can skin, bushcraft and campcraft. The hollow grind, drop point blade is 3.5"" long with a 3.25"" cutting edge. ** WARNING ** It came razor sharp out of the box! The plastic handle has rubber inlays which makes it extremely grippy and comfy.But the real cool feature is the one handed release, roller locking plastic sheath. The spring mounted roller rides up the ricasso and locks into the finger grove when fully inserted. It will not accidentally come out! A push on the edge of the sheath with your thumb pops it loose with just one hand.The sheath has a nice horizontal drain hole which can accommodate a lanyard for a neck knife hang. One handed release also allows for belt, pack or boot mount.The knife and sheath weigh next to nothing and the cost isn't far behind.

"Got this light last week and I like it so far. It winds easily and makes a cool whirling noise to keep the bears away while hiking in the mountains!I know the first review wasn't favorable but here's the trick to these self powered lights. These small rechargeable batteries are designed to keep a charge on them. If you buy one that's been on the shelf for a long while without being charged the batteries can loose their capacity to hold a charge. They are charged from the factory so the best time to purchase them is after a power outage when the stores have replenished the shelves... you will have a better chance of getting a ""factory fresh"" unit. Not foolproof but the odds of getting a longer lasting light are better. Don't buy them from the clearance rack! I've seen several youtube reviewers complaining of this also. Once you do buy the light be sure to crank it for a few minutes each month and never shelf it dead. Keeping it charged will extend the capacity of the batteries for a much longer time. Don't overcharge though, lithium Ion batteries could be damaged.Now back to the Light. It has 3 modes... off, on and flash. When on, the 3 main white LED's throw light ahead. Press the switch again and the 3 white LED's along with the 2 red lensed side markers flash. This is great for signaling. The rated 7.7 lumens won't blind anyone but it's enough light in an emergency. It has a 2032, 35mAh battery and one minute of winding is supposed to power the 3 LED's for 15 minutes. This info is from the Dorcy website which differs here. I wound it for about 5 minutes and it lasted for about an hour initially. This time should actually increase as the batteries are exercised more. The rubber knob on the sturdy crank handle locks into the light body and a lanyard can be attached to hang it. The shape of the light, crome crest above the lense and hazard type marker surrounding the switch gives it a weird retro look but that's okay. The yellow color makes sense and the ruber side grips work great.I hope this review helps everyone. Happy Lighting!Update 10/23/11:The light no longer works.

"Should be called ""The Forever Light"" because that's how long the batteries last. I've used this flashlight around the house for about 2 years and it is as bright as day 1 using the original carbon zincs, not alkalines. Now, it's not the brightest flashlight in the world but it throws a sufficient beam to light your home, path or trail. The 3 LED's are low power and sip amperage from the 6 AA's keeping the heat down and preserving battery life. The beam has a moderately clean spot with plenty of spill light to brighten any room. It only opens at the head to replace the batteries and is sealed with an o-ring for water resistance... this is good. I love the gel grips. They feel great and mine have stayed clean and serviceable without peeling off. It has been very durable and if it ever gives up the ghost I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again! I recommend it. Oh yeah... got mine at walmart for 8 bucks.Update Feb 2013:Yup... after more than 3 years on the same batts still bright as day 1 !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QE58KKFUDJP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M0N8K6#wasThisHelpful","R2QE58KKFUDJP1","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nothing fancy here but certainly has its place among other sharpeners. The ceramic seems to be a fine grain and enough strokes will hone an edge very near hair shaving sharp. That's pretty good if you're in the field. I think it would compliment a coarser diamond rod or stone to keep you in cutting form. It sports a large and small curved edge for serrations, two flat edges and a hook or scribe sharpening groove.The rubber base has angled edges to rest it on a table for proper sharpening angle but this procedure is not fool proof. I pulled the bottom rubber base off as I like to free hand and this allows for a longer stroke. It was only lightly glued and can be easily reinstalled. The beaded chain allows for field or keychain carry.

"Big black Buck beauty bundled with the same quality as the original Nighthawk plus a few extras, minus some metal! That's right, there are 3 holes where beautiful, thick, strong steel used to be. The center oval can be used to turn O2 bottle valves and the rounds to bend thick wire or other items... Buck calls them utility notches. They also serve to lighten the blade. Okay, this is nice but I'd rather have the steel. The ""holes"", all black handle and new molle type sheath give it that tactical flair so many knife enthusiasts crave these days.Bucks 420HC steel continues to be magical and gives very little to complain about. It still boasts their famous heat treat. The grip is excellent for those bloody encounters after a successful hunt. The new sheath design is awesome. Quality nylon, molle strap on the back, storage pouch on the front, leg tie... it's all good and can be modified to fit your style in many different ways. It's a collaboration with Tops' Mike Fuller and would do well hanging from anyones belt. Use it for hunting, camping, bushcraft and even as a survival tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDE6F2OJ6TBOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X1B1HS#wasThisHelpful","RDE6F2OJ6TBOY","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very pleased with the look and quality. Yes, it's chinese 440c steel but looks like it was hammer forged over an anvil by a crafty, early period knifesmith. The chip flint blade finish, inlayed scrolling and Colt emblem really bring this knife to life. The full tang clip point blade is 5/32"" thick, 1"" wide, 4 5/8"" long and has a 4 1/4"" cutting edge. The knife is 9"" long from end to end. It has good heft to it and is very comfortable to work with in different grips. No thumb jimping which is fine with me. The grind is slightly hollow but strong. The handle pins are polished and there is a sizeable lanyard hole lined with a brass roll pin.You could skin with this knife just fine but bushcraft seems to be a better fit. The edge needed some touch up and I reduced the steepness of the secondary bevel to improve its cutting ability and ease of sharpening. The sheath is very good quality, holds the knife tight and smells like cowboy leather.

"Another High Value Winner from S&W. I got this knife for two reasons: 1. I'm cheap 2. It cost 12 bucks 3. It looked like it could be a comfy bushcraft type knife... okay, that's three reasons. Anyhow, I was right. The blade is thick at 5/32"" and has a nice traditional drop point. The 420C doesn't seem to be the highest quality steel but should work wood with no problem. It is stamped ""Hammer Forged"". I can't imagine what this is supposed to mean... maybe a stretch of terminology to describe the manufacturing process and an attempt to conjure up images of the crafty old knife maker working red hot steel by hammer and anvil?It has a steep, flat grind and secondary beveled edge that wasn't very clean and sharp so it required a bit of a touch up. The edge is now more in line with the grind and looks smooth and polished... really cleaned up well. A shallow edge will improve cutting and ease of sharpening. It's 9.5"" long with a 4.5"" blade and 4"" cuting edge. The rubber handle is removeable and reveals a full tang which is the same thickness as the blade but not as wide... it's cut down a bit with a rounded, not 90 degree angle. This is good for strength. The handle slips off the tang easily and should be shimmed before reinstalling and tightening the fasteners. I'm also thinking of adding sealant to keep moisture from entering at the ricasso and fasteners. This will give it a more solid feel.The rubber handle is extremely comfortable in my hand and you can choke up on the front choil for close work. It feels like you could work it all day without discomfort. The rubber really grabs the hand... it won't slip even when wet. The sheath is surprisingly good. It's actually plastic that is covered with balistic nylon and has a second plastic liner where the knife slips in. It's held closed with 4 solid rivets. This stiff sheath grips the knife handle even before being secured by the velcro retaining strap... it doesn't move at all. Nice S&W Bullseye logo is sewn on.

"I have 3 sets of these bags, one set as low as 20 bucks on sale. For the money they are outstanding. The stuff sack style allows you to pack them tight then flip the cover over and buckle it down. They are spacious! Great for cummuting and touring.Here are the specs from Nashbar:WEIGHT:  1302gCARGO CAPACITY:  2,350 cubic inchesCARGO VOLUME:  2,350 cubic inchesDIMENSIONS:  14 x 14.5 x 5.5""NUMBER OF POCKETS:  3MATERIAL:  Nylon corduraI have had these bags for 3 years and have logged thousands of miles with them on my bike... I have had no problems. The cordura nylon is strong and the zippers are easy to use. The gray stripes you see are reflective and light up like a beacon at night. There is a compression strap that wraps around the middle to keep contents secure. The deep side pockets have dual zippers and are very roomy. I put camping gear like tent pegs, shovel, guy outs and such in one, personal/hygiene items in another, bike tools and parts in another and the last carries need to get quick items like hat, gloves, camera, phone etc. Now, remember, I'm just talking about the side pockets fitting all this gear... there are still 4 bags to fill but I think you get the idea of the room these bags have.They ride very securely on my bike. Two rubber coated hooks, velco strap and attached bungee do the job. If you attach them properly they will not bounce off or hit your spokes. A plastic panel which lines the back of the bag provides some stability. My only complaint about these bags are the odd covers. They are elastisized around the edge and unless the bag is fully packed they won't cover the bag so well. They do the job but a full, wide cover that descends the sides of the bag would be better. There is a zippered pocket along the top of the cover but if the bags are packed full and the cover is stretched over the top this pocket is not very useable.The bags are not waterproof but highly resistant. You can place sensitive items in plastic bags or line an entire bag with a large waterproof bag... I've done both. I also sprayed the bags with water repellent which prevents the material from soaking up water weight.Okay, these are not $300 Ortliebs and certainly aren't as well made. If you're planning a remote, extended trip to a far away land I would suggest a more bullet proof set but if you're looking for serviceable and inexpensive bags to get you started and then some, you can't loose with the Nashbar ATB's. I would certainly buy them again!Check out the pics I attached...","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFTI5BMPIYHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UME0S2#wasThisHelpful","R1BFTI5BMPIYHA","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:48 MinsThis knife isn't a great buy because it's a great knife, but a great knife because it's a great buy. Come on, you get an almost 4"", 440c blade with finger flipper, lanyard holes,ferro rod striker (the jimping at the end of the liners), tactical features, comfortable handle, cool blade paint and deep carry pocket clip for 7 change delivered.The drop point blade is fairly thick and menacing with a nice even grind and edge. The flipper acts as a finger choil if needed. The liners protrude past the end of the scales and house the laynyard hole. It's also nifty that the edges of these protruding liners are jimped for use as a ferro rod striker. You would think this folder cost 50 bucks after listening to some of the complaints in other reviews. At this price I'm willing to sharpen the blade and tighten a screw or two... what's the big deal? Of course it's not going to be a zero defect knife at this price.By the way, mine was extremely sharp out of the box and my screws haven't budged. My blade does not lock tightly into the handle as others have stated and can come loose but at this price I'll live with it or fix it if possible. Blade centering when closed is off a bit but this doesn't effect the use of the knife at all. For The Money, This Knife Rocks! I would recommend it to anybody and I'm going to buy a few more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PUW1GZW2HAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CPGVB4#wasThisHelpful","R30PUW1GZW2HAS","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my eye on this knife for more than a year now and noticed a drop in price... and then another drop, $33.50 with free shipping and it was just a reflex at that point. After I bought it I watched it go down to $29 here on Amazon... THIS IS CRAZY!!! Getting 1/4"" thick, 1095 steel blade at this price is absolutely SICK! If you're looking for a Tough, Beefy, Heavy Workhorse of a knife... Look no further. An Incredible buy at this price! I'm not a prophet but I predict this knife will be one of the most popular survival knives in a year or so. I bet they will fly off the shelf once everyone catches on and gets over the overseas production thing.After I opened the box and pulled the plastic off I was in love. My next observation was that it seemed smaller in person than it did on the video reviews I've been watching - it just has a larger look on screen than in real life. This is a meaningless observation but thought I'd share it. The next thing I took note of was the removable handle. Most all of the Amazon reviews and video reviews lead me to believe the handle was a soft rubber... it is not soft rubber or at least mine isn't. It is a hard, kraton material that seems to be very durable and is quite comfortable. It's not perfectly flush with the tang but I feel no discomfort and have no concerns with this. It's a large handle and provides several different grips. You can choke up by placing your index finger on the choil which provides excellent control for close up work. My hands are small and can grip it behind the index finger groove for better chopping leverage. The contoured shape fills the hand and the flared end keeps it there. The raised circle pattern provides excellent grip and looks pretty cool.This knife is so thick and heavy for its length it feels like a club in the hand and makes you think it's indestructible. Makes that other ""Ultimate"" Knife look like a toy. After ogling for a while I inspected it more closely and found it to be very well made. The steel is finely and evenly shaped. The edge is precise and sharpened right down to the choil. The flat grind is only slightly beveled to form the edge giving it better cutting power than some of the more deeply beveled blades that are out there. The dark gray blade coating is tough and very handsome. It prevents corrosion, glare and reflection. The modest thumb ramp has large knobby jimping and works well but not so outrageous that it interferes with batoning or other camp/survival tasks. If you have to choose one knife this one can do it all!The nylon sheath is fine. It holds the knife securely with plastic insert and the handle retention strap length is adjustable thanks to velcro... it still secures with a snap. It has a removable front pouch that can attach to your belt separately. There is a velcro strap and snap on the back of the sheath that can be used on a molle system. Velcro belt loop allows removal of sheath without having to take your belt off. There are lots of ways to modify and upgrade this sheath with a little bit of planning. I added an extra retention strap by burning 2 holes through the belt loop with a torched nail and adding paracord with a spring loaded cord lock. Quick, run... buy this knife!!Update July 2012:Still lovin' this knife. It retains its edge and the blade coating holds up well. I chopped a 6"" fallen tree in half very quickly and batoned many a big log into smaller logs for the camp fire. I have no complaints with this knife and highly recommend it! It is starting to catch on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEDUJNJSYFE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033H7VI6#wasThisHelpful","RKEDUJNJSYFE6","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I caught the all black knife on sale for $12. I can honestly say, you won't get more knife for so little money anywhere. It's not only inexpensive but full of excellent features and usefulness. It's called a sportsmans knife but has a definite tactical edge to it also. The intermediate blade size is pefect for many uses such as camp, bushcraft, survival and tactical. Not excellent at all but can do it all.This kinfe is heavy for it's size, about 9oz, so ultralight backpackers beware - But I like that, it feels like a tool in the hand. Most of the weight is in the wonderful, full tang handle - I like that to. Lots of knives are skeletonized or have minimized tangs to save weight but not this knife, it's ready for some abuse. The more than 5"" edged blade has a dropped clip point and a very slight hollow grind with 1.5"" of deep serrations that are more suitable to cutting wood than cord, strapping or wire. The tang is about 5/32"" thick and extends this thickness 1 3/4"" beyond the handle. The blade came very sharp and takes an edge easily when needed.I love the handle. The removeable scales are rubber coated aluminum with smooth beveled edges making it very comfortable and grippy even when wet. The tang protrudes past the scales providing a tactical pommel with lanyard hole. The Ricasso has an upper and lower quillon that act as a thumb ramp and guard. I like the lower quillon which prevents your hand from sliding forward on the blade but not the upper quillon. Yes, it provides a thumb ramp for tactical purposes but I much prefer it to be flat which is better for camp/survival tasks like batoning. This is the only thing I don't like about this knife but it's a small issue and doesn't subtract from this great deal. There is thumb jimping which crosses the scales and also on the thumb ramp itself. The same style of jimping exists in the palm area and there is fine jimping on the lower quillon to help prevent your index finger from slipping.This knife is suitable for spear making. With handles removed you can lash it to a stick with cordage. You can also create a new handle with paracord for a different look and feel.The cordura nylon sheath holds the knife just fine but is nothing to write home to Mom about. Overall, a fantastic knife for the price!

"One of the smoothest opening, inexpensive folding knives I own! This knife came well oiled and the blade flys open with a slight flick of the right handed thumb stud. Love the blade shape and geometry. The blade has a nice belly with straight grind that hollows out a bit as it reaches the recurve towards the handle. This thing came very, very sharp with a nice clean straight edge which extends all the way to the handle - no wasted blunt stainless here... it all cuts! The back of the blade provides a slight thumb ramp with comfortable and effective jimping that is perfectly set between the aluminum handles, providing a sure grip. The blade has reach at 3.25"" and folds into a 4.25"" handle - that's a lot of blade in a small package at just over 3oz and 7.5"" extended.The zytel inserts over the army green handles look great and are vey grippy. The liner lock works well and has no jimping which won't tear up your index finger. There is also a slight cut out of the left handle for easy release of the liner lock. This is a smartly designed little knife! The black pocket clip is strong stainless and does not provide a deep pocket carry but with such a small and light blade this is okay. It does not block access to the pivot stud so it can be tightened if necessary. S&W even thought of a lanyard hole. Its light weight and long blade length make this a great EDC. Well worth 10 bucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2C8E9OA0FRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00131VVLC#wasThisHelpful","RJ2C8E9OA0FRO","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like everything about this knife. It's a perfect camp/utility knife and very well designed. The first thing you notice is how comfortable it feels in the hand... seems like you can work with it forever. The rubber scales peel back from the edges a bit and will wear with hard use. They cover a wonderful, full tang which gives you confidence when tackling the big jobs! I've seen some knives covered with a cord handle after the rubber deteriorated. The thick drop point blade makes short work of common camp tasks. It remains fairly thick, even to the tip. It batons, notches and shaves wood with ease. Nicely placed lanyard hole if you need it and may be used for tactical purposes.The blade steel is typically Gerber and adequate - not super hard like 1095 high carbon but tough enough at this price. I love the subdued, bead blasted Gerber finish. My son did manage to damage the serrations a bit but they still do their job. The sheath is just a sheath and holds the knife effectively, that's about it.This knife is a good, solid performer and no one would be dissapointed with it at this price. I wish Gerber would make a bigger 6"" blade version - that would be awesome!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RESPF9I2C2OZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VKV0RM#wasThisHelpful","RESPF9I2C2OZC","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the tool we've all been waiting for. No frills at all - that's why I like it so much. Just a lot of blade and simple wooden scales held tight with three brass pins... simplicity at it's best! Flat knife back to baton with and a full tang you can see all around the handle. I'm getting excited just thinking about it.The knife itself is 13"" from end to end. I think the 14.25"" designation is while it's docked in the sheath. The blade is 8.5"" from handle to tip and the cutting edge is 7.5"". This thing is a meat cleaver on steroids. The 1075 high carbon, black powder coat steel (older version) is 3/16"" thick at the tang and slightly tapers as it reaches the tip. It's full flat grind with a convex edge. El Salvador is stamped on one side and Condor, the other.My sheath is thick, supple, brown leather and retains the knife securely without a strap. The belt loop is attached with a single fastener so the sheath will pivot on your belt. The single piece of leather is simply folded over, stitched and riveted at both ends. It is embossed with the Condor logo. There is no drain hole but one can be poked through. I was thinking about just cutting the tip of the sheath off since there's about an inch and a half extra length after the knife is tucked in but I always hate to change the originality of something unless absolutely necessary.I took it to the back yard and laid into some logs. Oh my... sweet, sweet chopper! It seems to beg for more and it's so easy to oblige. The powder coat held up well but will soon yield after continued use as all coatings do. The Hudson Bay really brings out the inner primeval man - no rubber, plastic, micarta or mechanical fasteners here. I am Grizzly Adams... at the low, low price of $33!Update 24 July 2013: The knife broke about 3 inches from the tip while batoning/splitting Bartlett pear tree for the fire. I contacted Condor through their website and sent the knife in for replacement. It was shipped from El Salvador Monday and received today... Wednesday. It is brand new in the box including another sheath. This replacement has the new blade finish, better edge grind and improved handle. My old knife was simply painted black and the new has a rustic, chip flint style finish... very cool. The old edge was a convexed V grind which was okay. The new edge is not convex and is closer to a true V grind... very nice and sharp. The handle is much smoother and more rounded for a better grip. Overall fit and finish is improved. The knife weighs 15.4oz. Sheath weighs 5.2oz. I am well pleased with this new knife and the service received from Condor!I will keep my rating at 5 because one broken knife during hard use does not mean they are all bad... it can happen to any knife. Also, Condor made it right immediately! I thought this would be good for everyone to know!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HACCG8B14H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D9RBPW#wasThisHelpful","R29HACCG8B14H6","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pleasantly surprised with this folder. This is a good sized knife and not too heavy thanks to the aluminum handle. The handle has a textured finish and rounded edges which provides a comfortable grip. The lock back is very strong and gives the user a good sense of security. Because of this it doesn't flip open readily with the thumb studs so don't plan on looking like a knife fighter with this one. The blade is larger than it looks, almost 4"" from handle to tip and just under 3.5"" of cutting edge. It has a slight hollow grind. It says ""First Production Run"" on the opposite side of the blade and ""China - 05"" inside a circled Schrade emblem. I got the gray one from another supplier for less than 8 bucks delivered. The pocket clip is solid as a rock. I may get the black one also.

"S&W knocked this one out of the Park! Got this for 13 bucks and quite frankly it's worth every penny. The handle edges are beveled which provide enough comfort but rounding them off would have been better. The handle has a deep belly which feels a bit awkward and calls for a glove if used for longer tasks. No movement in the blade when deployed and the action is very smooth. The blade has a slight hollow grind and the serrations are toothy and should be better on wood than cord or strapping. No seperate liner lock here - it's actually the handle itself (frame lock) that springs over to securely lock the blade open. I like this feature - simple and rock solid. The pocket clip is strong but I wish it provided for a deeper carry. The finish is fine and it feels like a sturdy tool in the hand. A bit big for EDC unless you have your heavy jeans on so I plan on using it as a second bush knife. I'm very pleased and it will make a nice addition to my collection.

"This knife was well thought out and has some real good features but a few minor flaws. I think the good outweighs the bad. At first I was a bit dissappointed and wanted to give it 3 stars but the more I handled it the more I liked it. I bought it because I wanted decent serrated blade length without a lot of weight for EDC - this knife fit the bill which brings me to my next point. As an EDC, a strong, deep riding pocket clip is needed - Gerber nailed it here. I also like the fact that it has features suited for tactical and utility use. This makes it a good all around folding blade and adds value as an EDC.The finger flipper works great after excercising it a bit and the pocket clip acts as a finger hold while opening it this way. After the blade locks open the flipper takes its role as a hand guard. The EVO rests firm in the hand and provides a confident, comfortable grip. Love the black color and titanium coating. The blade was relatively sharp but not razor sharp. The serrations are subtle and should be good to cut cord, strapping and wire. There is slight jimping on the blade back but the handle edge extends beyond the blade minimizing the effectiveness of the jimping. Control is good enough nonetheless. The thumb studs work but I prefer the flipper. There is no play in the blade when extended. You can attach a lanyard to the bottom handle stay without the blade interfering.The tip of the blade on mine was not finished correctly which gives the appearance of a slight bend. A bit more sharpening on one side will correct this so it's not a big deal. When I flip it open sharply the liner lock overshoots the butt of the Blade and jams in the locked position. This requires excessive force, sometimes with two hands, to release the lock before closing. I don't think there is anything I can do to correct this defect but I'll give it a few more days of use before I decide on a course of action.I got it at Dick's for thirty bucks including a Gerber Clutch multi-tool so it was a fair deal. This is a good solid performer that will work well for many uses. I like it more now than when I started writing this review!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32KYY9N0WMYSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G0OMXK#wasThisHelpful","R32KYY9N0WMYSD","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always looking for inexpensive, bright and long lasting lights and finally decided to pick this one up and see what its got. Purchased it at Target for 15 bucks... if it's no good I can take it back.What caught my interest is 60 lumens of light lasting for 48 hours. This would be exceptional if true. The package also says 72 hours on low at 18 lumens. It has a strobe function which blinks slowly at high power if you hold the switch down from any setting. The red LED is, well... a red LED - I don't use those much. The sequence of light is low, high, red then off. The orange face is brilliant on high and while flashing which can be used as an emergency beacon. This is a good safety/survival feature. The whole case glows when the light is on and glows red when that LED is selected.It's still a sunny day outside but I can tell that this sucker is powerful. From inside a dark room the spot looks tight, bright and white. The switch is of good quality, easy to find with the right hand and has a nice positive action when depressed. The aluminum battery compartment cover screw works fine and is received by aluminum threads nestled in the case side. There is a rubber gasket but it doesn't provide a guaranteed seal - maybe a bit resistant but not water proof.The overall quality of the plastic case and lens is adequate but certainly not unbreakable. I would rate Energizer headlights a bit better in build quality. The tilt mechanism works fine with 4 different settings. I'm okay with the color as it would be easy to find inside your pack or drawer. I'll update this review after a few days of use.Next day update: Well, I guess 60 lumens for 48 hours isn't gonna happen. I thought it sounded to good to be true. I turned the light on high at 9pm and it provided full brightness for about two hours before I could notice a significant reduction in brightness. After 3 hours it was about as bright as it initially was on the low setting. When I awoke at 630am it was still shinning at about the same dim brightness. So that's 9.5 hours so far. This light obviously has no output regulation. We'll see what happens tonight.Next day update: Left it on again for 9 hours and it's still putting out light but no where near the original 3 hours of 60 Lumens. It is now very dim - about as bright as a 10 lumen light. I may keep it though because I like the strobe and the initial 2 hours of very bright spot light. Buyer beware on this one!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC3IQQ9PA0ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GESGZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1RC3IQQ9PA0ZK","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update May 2014: This headlamp has been upgraded since I purchased the single button model and wrote this review several years ago. This newer version has 2 buttons, more power, a low and strobe mode. I like it better than the original. Enjoy this review of he original version!I own several Energizer headlights and while they may not be known for their sexiness they sure are dependable. They all continue to work, and better than advertised at that! This 1 watt model is big but produces big light also. If you're a runner this one will bounce on your head so choose another model (new model has less bounce). This one serves me best at home and I carry the smaller, 7 LED model into the bush with me.The on switch is excellent. It sits right at the top of the light and responds with a solid ""Snap"" when depressed - no guessing here. Press once and the main 1 watt center beam comes on, again and the two red LED's take their turn, again and the two white floods come on line, one more time and the unit is off. I would prefer the sequence to be red, flood, then spot - less power to higher power,  but this isn't a big deal to me.The light output is excellent as I find on all Energizers. The packaging says the spot will shine for 5 hours and this Amazon description says 11 hours. Mine has lasted well past 5 hours but not sure if I made 11 - this is good operating time for 50 lumens either way. The beam is white and bright with little distortion. The white floods seem to shine forever on a set of bats and is the setting I use the most - good spill light here and plenty for normal use. I don't use the red lights much but they are nice to have. They provide a good flood effect and yeah, they last longer than forever and will protect your night vision.The light body is absolutely rock solid - I wouldn't say bullet proof but I take care of my equipment so I won't find out. The tilt mechanism is strong with a positive action and has 6 settings - the most I've seen for this type of tilt assembly. The battery case is easy to access and is complete with rubber seal for water resistance. The lens cover encapsulates all LED's and is sealed in place for a clean look. Nice foam padding rests on your forehead and the strap is wide, adjustable and comfortable.Like I said, this light isn't the sexiest, brightest, smallest or lightest, but for the money, dependability and functionality it is a smart buy. I'm sure I'll have this fine tool for many years to come!Tip if you wear eyeglasses:Any headlight will cause some annoying glare with glasses on so I recommend wearing a ball cap under the headlight or apply some electrical tape to the bottom of the unit. Any type of glare shield you can fashion will solve this problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26U1XH4R697GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PLI914#wasThisHelpful","R26U1XH4R697GH","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The packaging says this headlamp will provide 80 hours of light on high setting... NOT EVEN CLOSE! After about 5 minutes the light housing becomes very warm and after 20 minutes is extremely warm. I guess this is where all the power is going - HEAT not LIGHT. After 1.5 hours it was very dim on high and at 2 hours was just a faint glow - even the heat was gone. Mine would still shut off though. I thought Princeton products were quality but now I know. I just got it yesterday so I'll try returning it to the store. It's a shame because it is a very light, small and easy unit to use. Would be a great design if it worked. I'll stick with my energizers.Update: 4/4/11Dick's took it back and were unaware of the issues with it.Update 6/6/12: New packaging has been changed to read 2hrs on high.

"I just received the SW970 which is identical to the 960 and 980 except for blade features. The 980 has more of a clip point with false edge and the backbone is straight - there is no depression towards the upper guard/thumb ramp like the 960 and 970. The 980 is more of a bowie design and the 960 is a drop point with a spear point look. This 970 has a more of an upswept clip point with false edge and is more suited to skinning. $[...] including shipping from Thompson Tools through Amazon.It seems like it's a full length tang and the pommel is attached to the end, secured with a roll pin which forms the lanyard hole - this is good. The stainless pommel does wiggle and click a bit but it's aesthetic only and finishes the handle off nicely. You may be able to thump lightly on plastic tent pegs or someone's noggin but certainly not drive nails. The blade is also loose inside the handle but just a bit. This should not affect performance and the handle has no way of coming off.I've seen this blade advertised as 440c steel on other sites but it doesn't say this on the knife, packaging or paperwork. The 2009 S&W online catalogue says it's ""stainless steel"" and weighs 6.5 oz. It has a nice satin finish. The knife is sturdy, about 5/32"" thick blade, 11"" total length, 6 1/4"" blade length, 5 3/8"" cutting edge. It came sharp enough to work but not crazy, razor sharp. It feels great in the hand and is ever so slightly handle heavy, although I wish the handle was a bit larger. The handle material is harder than rubber, sturdy and provides a decent grip - not as grippy as rubber though. Other web sites say the handle is kraton - S&W catalogue calls it composite.The thumb ramp could be a bit more subdued and may get in the way of some camp/hunt tasks but helps with blade control nonetheless. You can choke up on the blade by placing your thumb around the thumb ramp and resting it on the back of the blade while your index finger rests in front of the bottom guard on the flat choil area. ""Smith & Wesson"" is stamped on the blade and molded into both sides of the handle along with the logo - this looks cool. ""SW970"" is stamped on the other side of the blade. The edge is a tapered 3/4 hollow grind and is designed to cut and skin but seems solid enough to split small wood for the fire with some light batoning... the 970 is not made to be pounded on. Some light chopping is possible but it's definitely not an axe and shouldn't be used as one. The grind on the 970 is a bit thinner than the 980 which makes it a better cutter.The sheath is standard S&W black leather with embossed logo which I love - well made and makes me feel like a cowboy. Even the strap snap wears the logo. I know about getting leather wet and sheathing your knife in it but hey, I just like leather. Great carry for backpacking and certainly menacing enough for self defense if needed.I used this knife for some light batoning and other woodwork and as I suspected it worked fine. The blade is strong but I wouldn't baton much bigger than 3"". I notched and skinned the bark of a few branches also. It has good control for a longer blade with a skimpy handle. The edge dulled quickly but is easy to touch up. Well worth the money!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUUUHL5ICM57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UUTAXS#wasThisHelpful","RAUUUHL5ICM57","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the many flashlights I own this has been one of the best. The biggest reason is the price... got it on clearance at Target for $18. That's a lot of light output for the money! It is solid and well made but certainly not indestructable. I don't abuse it too much or submerge it in water as it is not advertised as a hardened, waterproof item. It is protected by flimsy, misplaced o-rings which warned me of this. So don't soak this thing or hammer with it. Nice lanyard hole on the end cap!If you need or like a strong ""spot"" light this one will fit the bill. This is its main function. There is a bit of spill light available but only because of the shear brightness it puts out, not by design. Not sure how accurate other reviewers are with comments on Lumen output and I'm not a Lumen measuring expert but this sucker is Brilliant! The spot is Tight, White and Bright! I have a few more lights rated at over 100 lumens and the Dorcy is the brightest. Great for nightwatchman, rent a cops, mall security, outdoorsman etc. Not for serious life and death use such as military, tactical, firefighting, mining, diving etc. You should always seek out proper equipment if engaging in these type of activities.I love the fact that this light uses inexpensive, easy to find AAA's. This is a great and convenient feature for this type of light - thanks Dorcy! And your light will shine bright for well more than 10 hours! The polycarbonate lens will scratch but there are many products available to polish it up if needed. All in all a great product if cared for properly. I'm glad I have one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RGI7KXFXLCD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EIIYH8#wasThisHelpful","R2RGI7KXFXLCD4","A3EVEUG0GFT1LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EVEUG0GFT1LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was able to get my hands on this from a friend and it really does a great job in implementing many aspects of social media that you probably didn't know about to be applied to marketing. As we all may know social media is practically dominating our world today since everyone is on popular platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. so this book will teach you how to use those sites to gain some incentives.

My friend was kind enough to lend me this book to read after he finished reading it since he is a professional photographer himself, and after seeing what he can do it made me want to try it out myself. It gives you all kinds of tips and tricks and the nuts and bolts of the key points to photography to give you drastic and much better improvements in your photo taking skills.

"I’m a 34 year-old woman who has always struggled with motivation. I would have it in fits and starts (usually at the beginning of the year), but I could never maintain it over a long period of time to actually effect any positive change. I would make resolutions that would backfire. I would force myself to do something and then never do it again. Exercise had always eluded me. When I got my hands on Mini Habits, I was, of course, incredulous. My friend gave it to me and told me that it helped her get her life on track. After avoiding it for months, I decided to give it a try. I started even smaller than Stephen Guise did. I did 1 jumping jack per day for a week. I realized how easy it was and I bumped it up to 10, then 20, then 100, then 1000. Now I’ve got an entire workout regimen that I stick to consistently and I have Mini Habits to thank for that.Of course, I also have 27 Quick Life Transformation Tips to thank, as well. Written by Alvin Huang and Greg Frost, this book is filled with universally practical insights for improving your life. Mini Habits helped bolster by persistence, but 27 Quick Life Transformation Tips has helped improve just about every other area of my life. The book is separated into 27 chapters and each chapter provides a different step-by-step guide to improving your life. For instance, one chapter talks about how to utilize your 401 to get the most out of your retirement. Another talks about the health risks of detoxing and how to do it right. There are countless valuable nuggets of truth, and the writing is straightforward and witty.I would say that these two books have helped me get out of my rut. There’s a never-ending cycle of trying to get motivated, getting motivated briefly, and falling back on your laurels. These books have helped me break that cycle. I am more motivated, healthy, and driven than ever before and I’m so glad I came across these books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXGNMWELYUAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGKNBDK#wasThisHelpful","RGXGNMWELYUAE","A9ZK7XGLNEZLD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ZK7XGLNEZLD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Terrific, well made case my beloved, if somewhat un-popular HTC One M9.Good cases can be hard to find for this phone, and I have tried more than a few. The fit is spot-on-perfect, and does protect the phone. The case is substantial, and sturdy.I LOVE eco-friendly frustration-free packaging-- a plus.  To be fair, it adds some heft to the slim-lines of the phone, but.. it offers several layers of protection, which is most welcome.  The HTC One M9 is unique to begin with, this offers some extra protection.If you are attending a Red-Carpet event, simply take the case off!  The silver case gives the phone a futuristic, ""rugged"" look for everyday use.I was delighted to receive this case in return for a un-biased review.I originally bought a case at big box store, and though it was not inexpensive, it did NOT fit properly.  The Arozell DOES!Do not hesitate, if you are in gifting mode, or need a dash of everyday luxury, coupled with style and function.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2D8XYAU2S4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ODTG82#wasThisHelpful","R3J2D8XYAU2S4Y","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice pans that are perfect for induction cooking. Well balanced , and a dream to clean!  Ming's items are a significant improvement over most DRTV ( Informercials/shopping networks).I am NOT the best cook in the world (very FAR from it). BUT, having the right cooking equipment can turn you into a semi-chef!  I particularly like the grill pan, Steaks are terrific, and so are grilled ""artisan"" and regular cheese sandwiches on fresh sourdough! The griddle works so well for pancakes , eggs, bacon and sausage - a crowd pleaser, bar-none.If I can do it, YOU can too! Great gift for guys, college students, seniors, empty-nesters.

"Pretty amazing product - I saw results in 4 days, which may not be typical . Galderma is world renowned for RX (prescription) products, and their products work. This one is over-the-counter, but really works!I have been lucky enough to learn about the products from my Derm guy as well as a fantastic reputation in the film and television industry.  This non-RX product is easy to take, and offers noticeable results.I bruise easily, particularly in the elbow area, and, on-occasion legs. After taking the product for several weeks, I noticed a marked reduction in bruising, and better skin-tone.As a PLUS,  the dark circles under the eyes seem to be reduced.

"I have been a Jawbone fan for years, and this is the PERFECT tracker.It is more stylish, and, quite frankly easier to wear. The core UP2 is the same, but this is an edgy ( and for me ) a more comfortable design. This is the rock-star version, that adds fashion and a bit of snarky-smart wear-ability. The fit is adjustable, and works better for me than the original version.Set-up is easy, just charge it up, get the iOS or Android app and you will be good to go. It is a conversation piece , due to the design, and a bit of uncommon luxury. Designed for guys, but I can imagine this for gal's of any age.  The wrist design is edgy, and  unique.Battery-life is exactly like the original, outstanding.  Proprietary charging cable, but FAST.  The App is easy to use, and informative, you can modify it to tell you what you NEED to know.Great as a gift, or a bit of everyday Luxe ""smart-jewelry"" for yourself.

"The PERFECT wok! It is an amazing workhorse that I use all the time, sometimes even for breakfast.Unlike some, this wok is weighted properly, making it easy, and safe to use. Perfect for stir-fry, and you can get creative - tempura, even doughnuts are simple to make. Try eggs, bacon, sausage, red and green peppers and Vidalia onions-- breakfast in a flash!I am a single guy, and not a perfect cook-- but this wok is very forgiving, and so simple to use. If you look for similar items at the mall in specialty cookware stores, you might be hard pressed to find just a wok with Technolon+ of this quality, and it certainly would NOT include the high-quality lid nor the matching tongs.I have used this on my induction  unit, with great results.  If you happen to be in a gifting mode - sensational and thoughtful for most anyone. From college students to seniors ( both of which may not always eat properly..) this is a great option to consider.

"Nice enough antenna, works well enough.  I bought this on a whim, for an interior bedroom in my apartment. It was fairly good, but it really NEEDS the optional accessories to perform well.Inside the box is the antenna, a short cord, and  a plus-sale offer to make it work for most. I bought the ""best reception"" package after only getting 6 channels.Best reception includes a much needed 9 foot cord, and amplifier. After that, I got 31 channels, in crystal clear HD. Better than cable , picture wise.I like the high-end packaging, but wish it had all come together at one ( probably higher) price.  This one suggests you should be within 35 miles of towers.

"Another OUTSTANDING XEN-TAN product!  There is a reason film and TV studio pro's trust this brand.Forget about streaky, ""oompa-loompa"" looks- this will not occur. I am a guy, with fair skin. I have used other XEN-TAN products before, with good results, on and off-camera. I was worried that this might be too dark, and mixed the first application with a small amount of moisturizer.I should not have worried, after leaving the product on for 45 minutes, I had a natural-looking light tan. a week later I went full strength, also for 45 minutes, and got a slightly darker great looking tan!I believe less is more, use the tanning mitt, and evenly spread the product on my arms and legs. I use caution on the face, and neck.While not inexpensive, the results are superior to other brands. I will note that the natural look is slimming to the leg's and arm's.

I have veneers and this is the ONLY system, that can re-fresh your smile to out-of-the-dentist-chair perfection.I have saved money by  reducing the teeth-cleaning at the dentist from 4 times per year to TWO - this alone, pays for the unit, and a few brush replacements!.  The unit is intuitive, and timed to perfection.A bright smile is important, in the entertainment industry, or not.  Maybe you are going after an audition, or a new job, or interaction.  Can a toothbrush change anything? YES.

"NuFace has been on my radar for some time, and I have used galvanic response systems for years - the technology has evolved, but this has been used in motion picture/TV studios for decades (like a LOT of them, even before ""my day"" LOL).You can also find treatments in salons and spa places at around $85-120 per treatment, with a 7-12  treatment plan suggested. The equipment may look fancier, but NuFace is using the same FDA approved experience. And the SAME results, I might add.If you go to the gym regularly to tone your body, this is the same concept - I do think some instant ( but temporary) results can be seen, particularly in the brow area- but watch out Cinderella/Cinderfella - you DO need to use it regularly to see the long-lasting cumulative BEST results.  Trust me on this.You will feel your muscles twitch/tingle, but no real pain, this is a workout for your face. With regular use, you will find what is best for you. As a general rule, everything should go UP. (No training the face to go down, please!).The gel is important, and works well-- very high-quality, and I suggest you DO use it. In a pinch, in-between  gel orders, you may use 100% Aloe Vera Gel, but best results will be found with NuFace gel.I love the re-chargeable cordless feature, and when you get it, you will KNOW it is quality.  Not unlike a luxe cleanser machine that starts with a ""C""- the knock offs do NOT really compare, or last.Perfect for women, but as I am a guy- I will address that.If you feel a bit down, looking good, but wanted to re-capture the look you had when you were younger, consider this.  Perhaps it is a audition, a job-interview, or a class-reunion.  A photo-op, a wedding or just some good feeling everyday luxury, which you deserve.  You don't need injections/fillers (yuck) you need to tone, and firm that face.Give yourself a two-week challenge: Take a photo on day one, and use it for a week, take another photo, then use it every other day for a week.Take yet another photo, and see the results.If you don't care for it ( but I think you WILL) simply return it to Amazon.

"Okay, I have tried MANY self-tanners, some better than others, and this is about as close to perfect! The well designed mitt that comes with the product makes application a breeze. No more tell-tale ""tan"" between your fingers that you have to scrub off! Yeah!Some self- tanners can make your skin dry or tight, not this one. The color looks natural, NOTHING ""orange"" here. I suggest a light application for the first time, then go back and apply more if you crave a darker look. Another huge PLUS is the scent - It does not smell like any self-tanner I have ever used- this definitely brings to mind  mixed citrus and grapefruit, non of that typical fake-bake smell.Packaging is unisex, and I tested this on my fair skin, as well as on a lady friend in my apt. building with medium to fair skin. She agreed this was the best self-tanning product she had ever tried.I am on a health routine, and run every morning, but the white legs bugged me, a light application worked perfectly, a running buddy even said, you look toned!

I am very impressed!

"This one comes in a nicely designed jar that almost looks like an energy drink.I LIKED the information on the bottle, clear and easy to understand, and research if you desire to do so. After about two weeks or so of use, I like it. I started with 1/2 the suggested dose, as I was concerned about feeling ""jittery"" - which some products do.I used it in a watermelon/celery/kale/strawberry drink that I  do each morning and afternoon in a blender, one of the loud ones, designed to extract/pulverize stuff into a smoothie.I had NO jitters in the first 3 days and  went to the suggested dose over 4 days.

"Perfect hydrating mask!  I found the skin to be rejuvenated, and ready for HD make-up, as their is a lifting component. Great for on-camera work.The under-eye area is tightened after one use, and offers long term benefits, after a few weeks of use. All of the Phyto 5 products are good, and  are in pro-make-up kits.Used on it's own, you look better, and a bit younger- perfect for guys going to a reunion or social event.

"Nice and sleek looking and it is an upgrade from the previous model. Packaging is nice, and certainly SECURE.  If you are giving this as a gift, the ONLY instructions ( and I do mean ONLY) are to download the app.  Once you do that you are in business. I had no problem pairing to an HTC One running Lollipop.It seems pretty accurate, though in the first few day's it was choppy at best - I DO think the device ""learns"" how you move , sleep and such, far more accurate on day 3 than day one, in my case. I really LIKE the ""Smart Coach"" feature, after a few weeks it has yet to repeat anything.I am currently on a weight-loss/look better/ feel better program - and I do find this particular product to be motivational. I have found the battery life to be around 3 days, with my usage.As a rule, Jawbone makes quality products, and this is no exception.

"Very nice product with a high-end, box and packaging  (including a case) that make this idealI had no problem paring this to an HTC One , iPad ,and even my laptop.  Sound quality is good to great. I like the selection of earbud sizes as well, a plus. So far, I like this better than some BEATS buds that I have, Very rich bass sound.Charging was simple, and FAST.  The controls are easy to use, and intuitive.  Sound quality for calls was better than expected. I was provided with this unit for review purposes, which are honest and genuine.As others have noted, opening the charging port can be a bit of a challenge the first time, but kind of self-corrects -not a huge issue for me.The ease of use and the quality make this a top choice for gifting, be it a teenager or senior ( or those in-between ).

"Very BRIGHT, and only 7 watts, giving the performance of a 60-75W bulb. I had some older style ( and ugly-ish) compact fluorescent units  for the chandelier, from 6 or more years ago, and never had particularly good crisp light.  They were NOT ""dimmable"" either-- just ""off and on"". And, It took them a while to ""warm-up""!Flash-forward a few years, and you can have brilliant, dimmable LED's from LOHAS.  Smaller and far brighter than what I had ( I can now, ...ahem.. see CLEARLY that I need to dust the chandelier more!). It is over my glass dining table, and colors ""pop"" in a pleasing way - a green salad with beefsteak tomatoes, romaine lettuce, red onions and sourdough croutons looked like a magazine photo shoot!  Taco's looked great as well! ( and the Sangria, with fresh colorful fruit, home-made!)The lights are a significant ""upgrade"".  I was provided with a sample, for an honest review, and will be buying another set of three for my chandelier.  One note: The aluminum part of the light has a modern ""industrial"" look when viewed at a close distance - I like it, and think it adds to the look.High quality, caring packaging, and FAST Amazon Prime delivery is another plus. Depending upon use, the units are rated for 30K hours - that's probably years of energy-saving bright light for most people. Well worth your consideration, for a bit of every-day luxury.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYHWAW325BNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QII4RNE#wasThisHelpful","R3VYHWAW325BNK","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice smaller unit, with more than enough power -- I was amazed ( and embarrassed) by the amount of dirt/dust on some curtains, and the furniture.  I mean they 'looked' clean, but the proof was in the cyclonic chamber - very enlightening!This is PERFECT for carpeted stairs, and well worth the price of admission, were one only to use it for that task. The wand is light, the cord is long, and you have continuous power to get the job done - unlike the nice enough hand-held rechargeable I had been using for that effort. There is a reason my carpeted stairs looked half-done: They were, as I always had to stop and re-charge.I like the simplicity of this unit, out of the box, it makes sense, no fooling around weird-o assembly. The instructions were well written, concise and easy to understand.Does well on bare floors and low-pile carpeting, as well.  The compact size make it ideal for apartments, dorm room's, or to clean out the car( admit, you probably need to, I sure did!).The filters are washable, and appear to be high-quality as well.  Of course, being bag-less is a plus, once the canister is getting full, you can easily empty it - just put the canister IN the trash bag, release the dirt and you are all set.A great complement to your ""big"" vacuum, or depending upon your living space and need's - this could easily be your main unit. Bissell is a brand that has been in my family for decades, and is a brand you can trust- I have had a Bissell carpet cleaner for over 5 years, and it is still going strong, and saving me money.If you are in gift giving mode, or perhaps want to reward yourself with a bit of everyday luxury, you will like this one. The ease of use and compact size might be of particular interest for student's going off to college, and certainly for seniors who may have some mobility issues that can preclude the use of the big machines. I like gifts that people actually USE, and the Bissell OptiClean is one of them.Well worth your consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O13MM4IBI5DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WI2OOW8#wasThisHelpful","R2O13MM4IBI5DE","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you are in themood for a bit more, try frozen sangria! Super easy to use, and the bright colors are festive in the freezer.

"Comfortable for a run, but ( at least in my case), were a bit larger then expected. Probably will order again, but go down a size (or two) - Must have been swayed by some reviewers that said they ran small. Lots of ""room"" with the elastic waistband.  Pretty well made, quality material, with good solidly sewn seams.Comfortable to run in, somewhat reminds me of shorts that were common in the late 1970s' to the 80's - be aware you are wearing SHORT shorts.Should go without saying, but the material can be a bit transparent, which may or may not be an issue  > The liner is made of the same material as the short itself, and ..ahem.. offers no ""support"" if ya get me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIUBRPUTV5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1J5R3M#wasThisHelpful","R1MIUBRPUTV5K","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this on a whim, at a store , in the wine aisle ( hum, consider my mood!).I certainly should have shopped at Amazon, price wise, but... BIG MISTAKE!  The spheres are nice enough, average build, but one had the silicone ""top"" detached, and after 10 minutes of trying to get it back on, I gave up. Just filled it up, and put it in the freezer. It worked.End result was good, with or without the cap.  I just wanted them to work perfectly.  They do NOT leak as some do.

"Just perfect, and I have tried a LOT of chargers.Many, if not MOST do not do a good job with an iPad, offering a limited charge - not the case with this charger. Perfect charge on the go, to 98% , and it probably would have gone to 100% had I not needed to use the iPad.As expected, it did a terrific job with my HTC One, and  several speakers.  This would be a terrific add-on, as a gift for most anyone, from teen's to seniors.The packaging is high-end, and the ""feel"" or ""hand"" of the product  suggests quality. Heavier than some low-quality chargers, but still perfect for the briefcase, back pack or purse.  An EXTREMELY popular item at airports/rail stations where outlets can be hard to find.  Want to meet people? Use THIS product!  You WILL have ""new friends"" -- trust me.Perfect add-on for a new tablet or cell phone purchase.

"Really (REALLY) nice area rug, lighter than in the pictures.  Ultra-soft, with a nice backing, no sliding around! Talk about an instant upgrade to a room! Big, but manageable by one person.Thick and soft, it covered my ancient beige wall to wall  by a coffee table and the TV with ease.  A delight to walk on.  Form, function and design are perfect. No horrible ""new carpet scent"" either, I know you will appreciate that.  No need to air out the place after you lay it down.Because I am inquisitive, and it is not ""unknown"" to spill things here - I thought I might test out the Stainmaster, even though it was brand new.I deliberately poured a glass of cola, and a glass grape juice on the carpet, let them sit there for 10 minutes, and waited to see what would happen.I am lucky enough to have a Bissell carpet cleaner, but hardly needed it.The cola came up (and out) with some microfiber towels, and shockingly, so did the grape juice!  Amazing!  Since I had it out, I did a quick pass or two with the Bissell to be sure, but it came out clear. Impressive.Stainmaster came through like a true champion.The colors are muted, classic, and probably would be a good fit  for most decors.I would not hesitate buying this as a gift for a 1st year college student, or a senior in need of an area rug to freshen-up a room. Really, most anyone would like this.  It is rare to find an item , that is so nice, and will be used, by most anyone.  Terrific quality.

Much better quality than expected, considering the low price. Ultra-fast shipping, a full 28 days FASTER then the last expected arrival date.Though purchased for a funny shoot ( no, not ""that"" kind of film...LOL ) the shorts are best for guys that are slim and fit, to really wear out in the wild.  Very low rise, and certainly not baggy like some mesh shorts! I am 6ft, 170 and they actually looked okay with a t-shirt.Also very short, as expected, but comfortable.  For MOST guys, you will probably wear them under something.  The design has a bit of a shape-enhancing effect, for those who might want to know. The ""jock"" part inside tends to ..ahem... lift and create a noticeable bulge, which is probably part of the design/desire the manufacturer intended.They were okay in the wash, and then hang dry.

The plates have a higher lip than traditional plates, giving you a non-traditional, yet attractive look.I know this is funny to say, but the weight, quality, form and function reminds me of what you might find in a trendy restaurant. The set is not ""commercial"" , but is special.The bowls work for soup, salad or perhaps fresh fruit. The salad plates could be used as dinner plates for many people.

A handy book to have around, at a very attractive price.What I like BEST about the book is the organization  of the chapters, and that the ingredients are things that real people might have in real homes, or find in a real/typical store!This book happens to focus on Weight Loss, Detox, and Anti-Aging - something for everyone!Every recipe I have tried is good, but I REALLY like ""Wrinkle Fighting Smoothie"" on page 57, and the ""Aloe Vera Lemonade Smoothie"" on page 94. Those ALONE are worth the price of admission!  Were you to be lucky enough to find either in a the local ""smoothie store"" you would easily spend MORE than the cost of this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LG0MGGKT35LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502579995#wasThisHelpful","R1LG0MGGKT35LR","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty amazing unit, one that works BETTER than expected. I was offered this product for review purposes, and I do like it.Over the past 2 weeks , it has come in handy to document the 1st snow ( in my area) of 2015, create a few video messages, and have some fun in the office, and even on a boat trip across the river ( yes, it performed well in cold conditions)Set up was a breeze, and the picture quality was far better than expected, particularly if you do not move it around too much - let your subjects move!Very quick to charge, and for those in secret-agent mode, it looks and feels exactly like a high-end pen. In daylight the picture was amazing, with true RICH colors, spot-on perfect. Audio quality far exceeded expectations, as well.Packaging is nice, and rather luxurious - the box is high quality, with a magnetic closure, which is a nice touch, particularly for travel.I like the convenience of having a camera that you can slip into a pocket with ease.  Easier, and far more discreet than a cellphone or tablet camera. This is the way to go, perhaps at a speech, or event. It is FUN to use!  And, the ""wow"" factor will be there, when you show it to others, they will ask you where you got it. Trust me!From a  gifting perspective, this is a slam-dunk - from teen's to seniors, pretty much anyone would have fun with this. The ease of use is key to me- this is uncomplicated. The look is top-notch.  Really well made, and unique.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UDTWIKALWE7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSW9I5W#wasThisHelpful","R1UDTWIKALWE7N","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product as a sample, for an honest review.I admit, though I am pretty experienced in supplements, I took it s l o w.  One cap the 1st day, then two the next , then three. ( I admit, 4 a day is perfect for me, now, though the instructions suggest 3-6) .What an amazing, and positive difference after a few weeks! I really appreciated the documentation sent with the product, too.After just a few days, I felt BETTER.  After a couple of weeks, I feel GREAT! Better than I have in years, in fact!I take two in the morning, blending it into a iced coffee drink, and take two capsules before lunch. Works for me.The clarity, after a month or so, is quite remarkable, and to tell the truth, somewhat unexpected.  I feel sharper, and  significantly more relaxed in high-stress situations.  After reading the information on this product, and doing research, I think this is best-in-class - I felt an improvement on day 3, and the results appear to be cumulative.Packaging is high-end, and the documentation is science, which is proven.  Honestly, best of all, are the results -  you FEEL better. Priceless!A  happy ""side-effect"" ( for me, at least ) was the positive change in my skin - not only was I feeling better, I was LOOKING better!  Even skin tone, to go along with an even mood.There is a clarity at work ( and I work in a high-pressure environment) , a true-feeling of less STRESS, and greater FOCUS.While I will not call it a ""Genie In A Bottle"" , it has certainly worked for me!The looking better part, was a welcome, and ""unexpected"" PLUS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TV9RQTKOX2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAIY5US#wasThisHelpful","R3TV9RQTKOX2O","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice product, if used properly- a LITTLE  bit goes a long way.Very similar to some very high-end brands out there, as well as products used for professional TV and Movie shoots. Do keep in mind the results are pretty instant, they are temporary - there are other products out there that offer long-term results.This is for a photo-shoot, a job interview, a class reunion, an event - when you need to look GREAT and a bit younger this is the one to go to.Perfect for the guys as well, use it full strength, or mix it with a moisturizer, and you will be good to go.

"Really nice product, solid build, great connecting cord that is not flimsy or cheap. From the get go, you will notice the high-end packaging, and guess what? A terrific instruction booklet!I am primarily using this on a Lenovo UltraBook  U410, and love having a hub, one that works so very well.  I have used this pretty frequently with flash drives, wireless mouse, external DVD drive, an HTC One and assorted other products.  Worked to perfection!  The blue light indicating the unit was ""on"" was NOT distracting, either.This might work well as a gift ( perhaps to yourself, you have been GOOD) for those who are a bit short on ports, it just makes everything EASIER.  Just perfect for a teen, a college student - and most welcome to seniors, who will love the plug-and-go ease of operation. No drivers to install, nothing complicated to be worried about.It just works!One of the IT guys in my office swears by the KingWin brand, for consistent quality, and superior build factors.Unlike some other brands, the connection to your laptop/device fits perfectly - to me this is key - REPLACING a USB port on an expensive unit due to damage from an inferior external device can be costly, to say the least.KingWin clearly understands this, and has made a high-quality product, one that you can trust and feel safe when using it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1060S3E1U7A60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGN8OW6#wasThisHelpful","R1060S3E1U7A60","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this item, and unfortunately it had been damaged in shipping. I contracted InterDesign via email and within two hours had a nice reply, and several emails sales and marketing. They were very helpful, and clearly stand behind the product.  They sent a replacement, and I was good to go!The tension rod is substantial, and has a high-end look to it.  A little tricky to get it sized properly and to ""lock it"" but if you read the instructions and maybe look at the video, you should be fine. Be patient, and give yourself some time. The 45-90 is large, and you need room to work with it, and measure your space.Once in place, it looked GREAT - like a custom piece! Nothing cheap looking here. Seems quite sturdy, though I would not hang anything too heavy on it ( nor would I with any tension rod ).  I was very pleased with the result.  When you consider the cost of a custom rod, installation  this is one DIY project that will save you 100's.Just give yourself enough time to do it right!This is easy enough to do by yourself, but having two people working with the install might be a consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37X4M5ASI25FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7XXGFE#wasThisHelpful","R37X4M5ASI25FW","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When only the BEST will do, this should be your 1st choice.To be fair ( or a bit crazy ) this is an expensive unit, no question - but it CERTAINLY offers results that rival, or exceed the product that you find in a premium coffee retail shop.After using it for 30 days or so, I have learned to USE the unit, and create the best coffee I have ever had, coffee house or not. The manual is detailed, and well worth reading.While not heavy-heavy, the unit is substantial, around 20 pounds. It fits into my kitchen, under the cabinet with ease.  (smallish apartment here).  Set-up  was pretty easy, though I was almost intimidated by this ""Rolls Royce"" of the coffee world.  Would I screw it up? Do I DARE turn it on?I got over myself, and showed it to a neighbor who is a Barista.  1st comment was : YOU have THIS? It's the BEST!  Yup.We tried several functions, including the coffee ""profile"" - sublime!  The grinder function was loud, but powerful, with perfect results. Brewing was a bit quieter, not unlike other units.The quality of the brew was outstanding, using whole beans.  Similar result with ground coffee.  I felt good as a novice.  I am a fan of espresso( particularly in the morning) and was not disappointed. Perfection.I used the unit to make espresso ice cream, and cookies - a hit!  ( Sent the cookies to mom, with broken up dark chocolate squares on top).I am not a coffee genius, by a long shot.  But, that being said, this unit has made me try new beans, settings, and DELIGHT others.  (and show-off a bit).And, yes, the unit has more than a bit of style, and exclusivity.  Sometimes, everyday luxury is just what you need. Many people do not even know this unit is on the market, or how good it is.Considering  the cost of visiting a coffee shop, even 5 times a week, at 6 bucks a pop +/-, this becomes a value, very quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZUNQ2FHGKVPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OL1WG1A#wasThisHelpful","RZUNQ2FHGKVPA","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Certainly the platinum standard in humidifiers - I rarely use it on ""high"". I reside in a 870 SQFT apartment.What a difference from the normal units one finds in stores -- significantly higher power , and a better build.  Somewhat complex , as it has a demineralization cartridge , the hydro cell filter, and a descale cleaner.That being said, it performs wonderfully, with no ""white dust"" or smells that other units have. I suffer with allergies, and wear extended wear contacts - which can be an issue in a too dry environment, particularly at night. I like the blue light, which you  can adjust.My ""sweet spot"" is about 50% humidity, which the unit tracked, and handled with ease. When I ran it on ""high"" I had a 70% level, which was too much for me, but I was amazed by the products ability to reach this level, quickly. ( My plants LOVED it, however!)Without being too gross, some humidifiers REALLY can get a ""moldy"" or ""mildew"" feel, over a short time. Not to mention the ""white dust"". Air-O-Swiss solves this. This is huge to me.Over the years, I have bought and DISCARDED humidifiers, after a single-season of use.  No doubt, this is an investment, but over-time, I think it will be a value.A friend saw mine, and immediately ordered one for a family member who is in the early stages of COPD - while this is NOT a medical device, it might help in such situations.

"Just a terrific Bread Maker! This is a replacement for a West-Bend I bought almost 16 years ago (which still works) but I wanted a smaller footprint - I will move the older unit to another house.I LOVE the TWO dough paddles, and feel this tends to make a superior bread to the single-paddle units. This unit is somewhat lighter, and certainly takes up less space, but offers the yummy quality bread that West-Bend is known for.I noticed that the Hi-Rise does live up to expectations, compared to the earlier unit - even with sourdough!You can make simple breads in a breeze or get more creative.  I am a bit on the lazy side, and tend to go with basics- with outstanding results.Guy's, there is NOT A BETTER GIFT out there, be it for yourself, or others. Just a perfect gift for seniors, and college age people- this will create a ""comfort-food"" option and delicious aroma, that will be so welcome.Operation is super-simple for basic breads (which become artisan, because you make them!) - water, butter, flower/mix and yeast.  Then turn it on. We are talking a 60 second prep time. I bought a unit for a vision impaired parent - suddenly, perfect bread baking was again an option. Priceless.If you pick this up, perhaps add in some sourdough bread machine mix, or if you are in the mood, sourdough starter, you will love the results.Great Amazon price, and sensational two-paddle results!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZTGPD60YZJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL8SM74#wasThisHelpful","R1TZTGPD60YZJ2","A3VBZDYGHF4NK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBZDYGHF4NK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guys ( and ladies, for that matter), this one works like a charm.  I was introduced to this on a commercial shoot, by the hair and make up people.I have fine, thin hair that can be hard to manage, unless you use a TON of products. This one creates a full look - within seconds -, and is NOT sticky, nor does it have  a bad aroma. I have actually used LESS product to hold the style after using this!There are similar products out there that ""plump"" the hair, at a variety of price points ( many of which are significantly HIGHER priced than this one), but the Head and Shoulders version is the BEST that I have used.After you use this, your hair is noticeably fuller, thicker and will have a sleek shine - the product is essentially weightless, and  undetectable to others, your hair just looks thicker, and nicer.I was so impressed with this, I went out and bought a bottle for a friend, who has BIG TIME thinning hair issues - he was a skeptic, but within a minute or so, he was convinced - dramatic results! He looked better, younger, and had more self-confidence.I know the price can be a concern, but sometimes you DO get what you pay for, this is a top-of-the-line product, and is well worth the price of admission.I think this would be a welcome gift, as everyone wants shiny, healthy, full hair.

"Very nice unit, and rather high-end packaging, making it perfect as a gift. I have had several back-up ""Power Banks"" at a variety of price points- this one is easily a CHAMPION.I like the size, the ease of portability, and 5000mAh is just perfect for my regular needs.

I probably use it every other day or so.To tell the truth, this may well be the best Power Bank I have used.

"Very nice unit, and is really has even heat.  I bought it to have an ""extra"" burner, but now find it is my go-to method of cooking everything from steaks, stir-fry to soups.Of course having the right cookware is essential, if a magnet sticks to the bottom of the pan, the pan will work with induction , if not, it is a no go.Perfect for singles, college students and induction can easily be a safer way for seniors to cook ( in my opinion).The Nuwave PIC is super portable too, and that can be handy for serving/cooking at the table, camping and vacation homes.On television and film production sets, induction is a preferred method of cooking, from the craft service (snacks) to the full service catering trucks and set-ups.Getting an induction range ( or insert ) can cost hundreds if not thousands.  This is a cost effective way to try induction cooking from a trusted and well known brand.  I have used this for over a year with outstanding results.Currently, the product is  being promoted by a celebrity chef on a leading television shopping network offering live demonstrations of the versatility of the product and induction cooking, in general.I gave one to some friends of mine who have a RV ( which I might NOTE, is NICER than my apartment!!

"I have had this one for over a year, and realized I neglected to review it! This is my go-to headset, and nicer than many models out there.The sound is crisp and clear, and the set it self is substantial enough so you probably will not lose it, nor will it ""fall-off/out"" of your ear, as some do.Plantronics continues to support and update this device, which is most welcome.  I LOVE the sensor that ""knows"" when it is on your ear or not.  Lesser models do NOT have this feature!  This , alone is worth the price of admission for me.Charging is quick, and it has a nice stand-by time. It has a multitude of features which you may or may not elect to use. Bottom line: it works flawlessly for calls!While it think it is designed for power-users, it also makes for a welcome gift to casual users - I know this as I gave 2 as gifts, one to a co-worker in his 20's and another to my mom, who is vision impaired and in her late 70's. They both love it, and use it each day!Mom in particular has made good use of the vocalist features - the ability to HEAR email is essential to her, as is the ability to pair the unit to iPad and other devices.

"Lighter then the Nutrient Moisturizer ( which I like to use at night ) the Green Apple Age Defy just feels GTRAT on the skin, with visible results in just a few days.All of the Juice Beauty products that I have tried are good, but this is a particular favorite -- just light, hardly any fragrance, and you can read the back of the box to see everything in here is good for your skin.  This one has apple juice, white grape juice, lemon juice and (of course!) aloe juice, all organic.Nice complement of antioxidants -CoQ10, DMAE, and  alpha lipoic acid, along with other ingredients which encourage wrinkle reduction, and add a bit of firmness.  Skin texture appears to be improved after just a few days of use.The product absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves no shine or the 'flaking' that can happen with other product lines. I wear contacts, and the very light fragrance does NOT irritate my eyes -- a big factor to me.I saw a noticeable reduction in forehead lines after using this product, and a firmer jawline - not bad!  As I have mentioned before , I was introduced to Juice Beauty product by on-set make-up pros on television production sets -  they know about what can enhance most anyone's look, and are un-biased.This is a terrific addition to the line, and one that I would not be without. As I write this, there is a chill in the air, another cold winter to follow - along with dry skin issues.

Intuitive to use, and you can be creative.I have done lots of things - from chicken/cheese filling, taco meat filling, pizza filling to sweet things like lemon filling and even a version of s'mores.Best of all, it is fast! By eliminating say 3 trips to a fast food/fast casual place you will have paid for the unit, and will enjoy knowing exactly what is in your food.

It's about becoming a medical doctor, about transitioning from rural India to urban America without losing India, about finding a middle way.

"4 1/2 starsI had a family party last night and got out my new, unopened toy for everybody to enjoy.  The 8-year-old niece loved these blocks, and immediately started building an amazing ""kooky Japanese house"".  We supervised the one-year-old, who just wanted to hold one of the ones with a hole in it, and made sure she didn't put it in her mouth.  The two senior citizens built 'temple gates"" -- mine was meant to be Egyptian, and my partner's was in the Asian direction.  I found the multitude of colors off-putting -- I think of modern and post-modern architecture as glassy, shiny, or cream colored, not these supersaturated colors of yellow, blues, orange, green, purples, etc.  Not every piece comes in every color, and I would have liked to be able to have pairs of things in the same colors.  The colors distracted me from the shapes and figuring out what to build.  Some of the shapes were totally inscrutable to me.  There are pieces with cylindrical holes in them that cry out for a matching dowel that would fit through them, but there aren't any dowels.  But these are all minor start-up complaints.  The quality of my set seemed fine -- I didn't notice any rough spots or other defects.  I look forward to my next occasion to try my hand at building something more elaborate.  The book that came with the set tells about various famous modern and post-modern architects, and shows a few buildings.  It has a list of all the parts and a couple of examples of buildings built from them.  I would have appreciated more suggestions, but perhaps they're on the website, which I didn't want to access during my party.  http://www.tsshure.com/archiquest-modern-post-modern-architecture-building-blocks/ gives you a good idea of what a structure looks like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KPMUUP6TCVMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5B764#wasThisHelpful","R1KPMUUP6TCVMI","A24ZEH6X4AJNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure how to review this.  It contains triclosan (check the other reviews for more info about this chemical) which is apparently dangerous.This product has the sort of ""clay"" feeling I associate with some facial mask products, which to me is a pleasant texture compared to lotions, etc.  It has a sort of waxy feel to it, too, reminding me slightly of that lovely post-paraffin feeling at the nail salon.  Using a small-to-moderate amount of it, I found it soaked into my skin quickly, not requiring a whole lot of rubbing.  My feet felt a bit better after the first use, and definitely improved significantly after a few days of daily application.So if you're not afraid of triclosan, this seems to be an effective product.

"I didn't read this book as a memoir but as an emotional analysis ofElena's journey at 23 from St Petersberg to New Jersey.  It's emotionallycharged, with many realizations from looking back at her life and thecommitments she made to her mother, older sister, and friends. Her attemptto separate herself from Russian culture and make her American life feelnatural and real, which was very difficult for her.  At every stepof her new life there would be circumstances and events that would evokeparallel but conflicting reactions from her Russian perspective.  This was confusingand disorienting.Marrying a man who accepted her for who she was helped her to understandand learn American life and that was very lucky for her, as she found not just ahusband but a true friend who didn't expect her to shed all of herRussian emotional baggage as quickly or completely as other Americans she knewexpected her to do.The main point she was trying to make is to rationalize to herself whyyou can leave Russia, but Russia will always be there inside you forthe rest of your life, complicating assimilating into American lifeand achieving new relationships.  The author finally managed to stop looking ateverything from the point of view of Russian fears and to accept her new lifeas a challenge that she could meet by separating herself from her ""Mother's""dominance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHIGLLFV9SQOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451689829#wasThisHelpful","RHIGLLFV9SQOM","A24ZEH6X4AJNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Slow start, terrific finish.  It took me more than a week to push through the first third or so of the book, as we meet stacks of characters and start the copying process.  Clare is gradually revealed as less than upstanding -- succeeding at her art is what drives her, and sleeping with a married man and letting him use her painting as his forms the background of the story.  But once the copy is finished and she starts working, first painting her own series and then desperately researching the painting that she copied to save her lover, one likes her and the book better.  I read the last half very quickly, and enjoyed it.  The mystery of the Degas painting is solved, even as the mystery of the Gardner heist remains unknown.I admired the way the author put Clare into a rich and fairly detailed life, with friends, a loft studio, and a very real city of Boston.

"This pepper mill is a bit overwhelming.  It was appropriately packaged without excessive layers.  I hadn't realized it was an electric mill, powered by six AAA batteries, which were provided.  It also came with a small users' manual for installing the batteries and the pepper, in five languages.  I found the print size a bit small and required lots of light to read it clearly.  I was pleased that I had an MIT engineer handy for consulting as I tried to remove the motor from its cylinder (i used a pencil point to move the clips), install the batteries, and then put the motor back, which I did backwards the first time.  After I followed the directions and put it back together I discovered that I needed to take the motor cylinder off again to fill the pepper chamber.  The whole process took about 20 minutes.  We all enjoy ""taking the Peugeot for a spin"", with it's cute little light.  Being able to adjust the grind is nice.  The pepper seems to last a long time -- we've only refilled it once or twice in more than six months of daily use.The device is solid and of very high quality, and lights up softly when in use.  One should pulse it, not just push it on and keep holding it down.  I like that one can vary the grind size.I enjoyed reading on the box that the Peugeot Company started out making saws in 1814 and moved on to coffee and pepper mills, and was the first to make a mill designed for the table.  I felt at first that I would have preferred a regular hand-twist mill, but this one is very, very cool.  I can understand why it costs so much, even as I continue to wonder why I couldn't turn my own grinder handle.  For anyone who wants an elegant and elaborate way to grind pepper, this is pretty perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6RERQFBXIKKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OW51CC#wasThisHelpful","R6RERQFBXIKKM","A24ZEH6X4AJNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZEH6X4AJNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The guys at the computer repair place wanted $170 for parts and labor, but seeing as how my laptop is three years old already, it didn't seem worth it.I watched a two minute youtube video and thought it looked simple enough.It was pretty easy to install.

I posted a picture. The side with no pins goes up.I just installed it, and am charging the battery up for the first time now. I'll edit this later when I unplug and see what the battery life is like.

"I bought this bracelet because if there's a mosquito in a two mile radius, it will find me and bite me...usually multiple times.

It's plastic but easy to open. No scissors required. The bracelet itself is lightweight, soft and very comfortable to wear.The mosquito repellent pack that fits inside the bracelet smells very strongly of citronella. I thought I might be able to wear it to bed because that's when I get bit the most, but it's definitely too strong a scent for that. I ended up wearing it for a bit then putting it on my nightstand next to me.The mosquito that made it into our bedroom left me alone completely.

I work at a music venue and I always need ear plugs however this is the first pair of fancy earplugs I've tried. Tonight I worked the loudest concert I've worked yet.

"I'd give this 4.5 stars if that was possible.I bought the purple floral dress, and I love it! I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely buy more of these dresses in different fabrics.Speaking of fabric, it seems to be a cotton/poly blend but doesn't feel overly synthetic. It has a nice weight to it and a some stretch. I'd say it runs a bit small. I'm 36/30/38, a solid size 8 (U.S.) and the large fits me almost perfectly. There is some gaping at the neck. I'm not sure if buying a medium would fix that issue or make me look like I'm stuffed into the dress at the waist. That's the only reason I'd knock off half a star.I believe it's fitted this way so that it can fit a range of bust sizes.I am very very happy with this dress!

"TL;DR Get an Ipad instead.Buyer beware!! I loved my kindle until two weeks ago when it died ONE WEEK out of warranty. It seems to be a software issue and Amazon won't repair it.What they were willing to do is give me $50 off a new kindle but, here's the kicker, they wanted me to send back my broken kindle, presumably so they can refurb and resell it. Unreal!One year after purchase there is ZERO support and Amazon expects me to pay another $400 for a new device. All in all, if I bought the new device, they'd be getting the original $400 I spent, another $400 for the new tablet, PLUS whatever they'd be able to get for refurbing my tablet.I'm buying an Ipad. It's worth it to pay the extra $100 up front and know that a year down the road, if it fails, I can take it into an Apple Store and have it repaired.Amazon lost two customers- my husband and I will never ever buy or recommend another Amazon device. In fact, I'm now bummed that I bought my husband a kindle just two months ago. I feel like it's just waiting to die.For reference, I have three kindles (HDX, HD and e reader) and a firetv stick.

Not the biggest deal and the rest of the case still works.The case comes put together and it doesn't look like two pieces. Be aware that it IS two pieces and you have to put them on one at a time. Otherwise the case won't cover both sides of the phone completely.Other than a small part breaking off right away, it seems like a good case.

"I bought a 2004 Prius a year ago and it looked like the headlights have never been changed or cleaned. They were super dim at night. Very very yellow. After using this restoration kit, I used my key fob to lock my doors and I was startled by how bright the lights looked when they flashed on and off.I did this as quickly as I could today, because I started late. I watched the video first, then referred to the instructions in the box during the restoration process. It was easy. I think some people really went nuts with the sanding. I didn't because I didn't start til 4:15 pm and I was worried I wouldn't finish before sundown. I did exactly 5 and a half minutes each headlight per the instructions, each step, using my phone's timer.Exactly one hour later, I was completely done and I swear to you, the headlights look like new. Very impressed. The Toyota dealer near me wanted $75 for headlight restoration. I did this in an hour for $20.Some people say the restoration lasts 9 months to a year... In my opinion, it is definitely worth $20 and an hour of my time once a year.For reference, I'm a woman in my mid thirties and this was easy. I did go through about 15 paper towels (because I'm messy) and a few squirt bottles worth of water. Definitely recommend using a squirt bottle for this if you're like me and don't have a garage/hose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UVA8TE0TUARA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00429NKWK#wasThisHelpful","R1UVA8TE0TUARA","A1P7HYZ19MSJBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P7HYZ19MSJBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"1/10 Final update- The phone is going back, and I hate it. I know no one will see this, but if you do, Amazon, fix your d@mned phone. No Bluetooth LE, no changing one of the least intuitive keyboards I've come across, no tapping a phone number on a web page to call it, no sending video mms, no otg, no escape from portrait mode with the carousel, atrocious battery life.... The keyboard was really the clincher for me. I don't do a ton with my phone, but I expect it to be good at texting, emails, pictures and sharing. It is good at none of these things. See ya later Fire Phone. The USED S4 (two year old tech?) will be far and away better than you. OH, and the S4 does that 3d stuff too and I can keep it out of a case and not worry that a slight bump is going to shatter the thing.1/7 Update- Changing my review to 3 stars.It's been a couple of weeks and the phone is ok. I still don't regret ditching my s3, but that's mainly because of the camera and the fact that I had been wanting to switch to tmobile for a while.Battery life is ok. Not great, not bad. I do not turn off dynamic perspective bc I like it.What really irritates me about this phone is that I don't get notifications from facebook, facebook messenger, whatsapp, and many of my games. OH, that AND that the phone has bluetooth 4 capabilities but it's not turned on in the phone, meaning your new fitness tracker or smart watch won't work with it. Bluetooth 4 came out in phones in 2011. 3 years ago. I have no idea why Amazon would put this top of the line phone out without bluetooth 4 enabled. It's insane.Overall, it's an ok phone. Like everyone else said, great hardware, not so great software. I have my fingers crossed that the software update in January will solve some problems. If they don't fix some of my (and others') major complaints, I won't buy a Fire Phone 2 if they go forward with one...if they do, I'd happily buy one!===============================================================================================================12/15 Very cool phone. I really like it and have no regrets about ditching my S3 for it!I understand people's concern about the ""walled garden"" style OS. I felt the same way about my HDX at first. Then I realized that everything it did, it did really really well. I choose it over my phone or computer all the time. This phone is close to the same.People are calling dynamic perspective a gimmick- and it is- but it's a VERY cool gimmick. I won't be turning it off! And the lenticular photo setting is great. I took ""3d"" pictures of my Christmas tree! When you email them, it gets turned into a gif. How cool is that?One of my issues with the phone is that you can't use the carousel in landscape mode. It's always in portrait (vertical). I love the carousel on my HDX, but that's because I always view it horizontally. I'm not sure why you'd make a carousel with big icons for a phone that's stuck in portrait mode.Battery life seems fine. I have a ton of backup batteries for my S3, carrying around a small powerbank if I need to is no different, but I'm not sure if I'll even need to yet.The camera on this phone is really good and I like the dedicated camera button.Two different Amazon Mayday tech people told me that a software update will be out in January to address some of the common complaints. My guess is that they're going to let people change the background on their phones and hopefully they'll give us something like Echo (or Siri), right now, there is a voice activated search, text, email feature, but it's pretty. basic. I hope we get Prime radio stations!Obviously, Amazon needs apps, asap. And driving/hands free needs to be easily accessible! Other than that, the phone is really great. I think the issues I have are minor and easily fixable.I super hope that Amazon makes a Fire Phone 2 for T-mobile with wifi calling. And that they keep supporting this device.You can use Jason Singleton's method to install the google play market. It takes about 3 minutes and so far is working for me perfectly.  http://www.yourbountyhunter.org/firephone/And you can make ringtones for your phone easily, you just need to use a 3rd party ringtone maker app. I used the first one in the Amazon app store and it worked fine.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZDHYLEFKLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC0USA6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZDHYLEFKLH","A1P7HYZ19MSJBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P7HYZ19MSJBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is so cool! Got it today and love it. If you're a Prime member, and/or have a Fire tablet, you shouldn't hesitate to get this.I had been watching Prime and Netflix with my PS3 but won't any more.The Fire Stick does so much more than just let you watch videos. Your cloud photos and videos are instantly accessible on your TV as well as your music and Prime playlists.The only negatives I can see so far is that there's no off switch, only sleep, and it needs to be plugged in.Oh, and the Prime radio stations haven't made it onto the fire tv yet. Hopefully they'll add those in soon.Everything I've started with it, music, videos, prime movies, etc. has started quickly and played back perfectly.The Fire TV remote app is pretty great too. The voice search was able to decipher everything I said on the first try. La Dolce Vita, Alice in Wonderland, Transparent, etc.Amazon did a great job with this one!I've been using mine all day now and haven't had any problems with the wifi dropping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEORQHJ2FH8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R3DEORQHJ2FH8B","A1P7HYZ19MSJBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P7HYZ19MSJBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Waste of money. One out of three cartridges worked, but of course I didn't know the other two wouldn't work until it was too late to return these.The one that did work rendered the wireless printing option on my printer useless because when installed, my epson printer will give me a low ink warning. When it's physically plugged into my computer via usb, an error message comes up with the option to ignore and print anyway. This doesn't happen when I send something to the printer over wifi.

"Like many others, my fireplace didn't come with a remote or any manufacturer's information.I received this as a gift, it didn't come from Amazon.com but I thought I'd share my experience with the fireplace and customer service information in case someone else needs it.It took me about a half hour on the phone with a website who-shall-not-be-named's customer service  center to get the shipper's information for the fireplace. In my case, it was shipped through Wayfair. Here's their customer service number for those who need it: 800-584-4348. They were very friendly but it did take another half hour before my problem was (hopefully) solved. My remote and instruction manual should be on their way to me. We shall see.For those of you looking for manufacturer's info, this fireplace is manufactured in China and distributed here through at least one company.As for the fireplace itself- I like it!It's not the best space heater- the low setting is useless and I guess I expected something that looks like fire to get hot. It does do the job, but not nearly as quickly as I thought it would. I was hoping it would heat up the living room quickly so we could have it on less and save some $$.It's pretty quiet- it started rattling last night but stopped pretty quickly. Overall, it's quieter than other space heaters I've had.I like the look of the fake fire too. I mean, it's fake, so if you're expecting something that looks exactly like real fire, you may want to play the yule log on your tv. It's a fairly simple illusion that's been used to fake fires for quite some time and I like the way it looks.Three stars because I think it's a good fake fireplace and an ok space heater but customer service is a pain in the butt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UC39ZS75R2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WORMC4#wasThisHelpful","R38UC39ZS75R2L","A1P7HYZ19MSJBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P7HYZ19MSJBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this product. Thanks to a few other reviewers, I bought this after purchasing a non-adjustable stick heater and reading reviews about it over heating tanks.Now, I have one of these controlling the temperature in two 5.5 gallon tanks with the identical adjustable heaters and just ordered another one to keep the temperature steady in a ten gallon tank I have with a couple of baby bettas in it that need a more constant temperature than my heater is providing.The controller has worked perfectly for three months.

"I had to send it back. I'm a size 8 normally- 36D, 5'6"". According to their size chart I am a medium. In fact, their measurements are almost exactly what mine are, so I ordered a medium. It wasn't just large in the bust though, the length and sleeves were way too long and the waist and hip measurements were also waaaay too big.The other things I don't like about this hoodie are the grommets and size of the pockets. I saw them in the pictures but thought that maybe because my bust is larger, they wouldn't be all the way up to my breasts. Wrong. The pockets went all the way up to my breasts which means the grommets were also on my breasts. Really bizarre. I've never seen pockets like that before.I gave this hoodie two stars because the material was nice and warm and had it not been for the pockets, I probably would have exchanged it for a smaller size.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRRV6P6LK6RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043OA13A#wasThisHelpful","R3RRRV6P6LK6RW","A1P7HYZ19MSJBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P7HYZ19MSJBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I deleted my original review because after a little over a month of owning this, I wish I just had a regular fish tank...OR that over at Back to the Roots they included information about fish in vs fishless cycling of tanks and more information overall. And there are a few problems with the design.Here's my experience with this tank so far.I started out with white cloud minnows in the tank. We had to get cold water fish unless we wanted to add a heater (another thing they don't tell you) because I live in San Francisco, and our house is usually 62-65 degrees inside.I changed out 20% of the water every other day while the tank was cycling because I was (rightly) concerned about the fish. These minnows are hardy, but fish in cycling can still damage their gills or kill them. They survived but after a couple of weeks I took them back and bought a betta instead because the minnows really should be in a bigger tank.So now I have a betta. And I love him.Unfortunately, the tank doesn't really live up to their self- cleaning claims. ""Dump some sludge eradicator in the tank every couple of weeks or get a snail"" they say. Having done both of those things, there's still a build up of ""stuff"" in the gravel at the bottom of the tank. I've just resigned myself to the fact that I might have to clean out the tank regularly, which would be fine if it wasn't a colossal pain in the butt because of the top, or throw this out and get a regular tank that's easier to clean (with or without a filter).Also, the plants sprouted really quickly and grew fast for about two weeks. After that, growth significantly slowed down. They are getting sunlight but obviously, this tank can't be directly in the sun because of the fish. I don't think we'll be able to eat anything that grows out of it because it will probably stay small and am doubting that it takes enough waste out of the tank.Problems with the design-- the pump! It really should not be housed in the top of the tank. It vibrates violently which is not good for any fish, plus it's really loud. I bought more airline tubing and moved the pump outside the tank- the entire top part of the tank. It completely warped within a week. They say it doesn't affect the functionality of the tank but the plant holder doesn't sit on the tray correctly.- the pump doesn't seem to take enough waste out of the tank. If there's waste floating about in the water, a lot of it gets pushed up to the top of the tank, but some of it doesn't and once it settles on the gravel, it's there to stay. Unless you clean the tank.I wish they would include a way to add a heater should you need one (bettas like warm water, around 78 degrees), and more information about cycling the tank including a fishless cycle option, however I do realize that most tanks don't come with this information.At this point, I'm not sure what I'll do with this tank. I'm obviously having issues with it that some others aren't having.I really really like the idea of this tank and I know aquaponics works, but I'm not sure this tank is really practical.Tip- If you want to take the top off without getting water everywhere, first take the plant tray off, then shove paper towels in the holes in the bottom tray and dump that water in the sink.FYI- if you want to see pictures of other tanks, check instagram, #aquafarm.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SGDG2JDXYIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN52TRM#wasThisHelpful","R5SGDG2JDXYIF","A1P7HYZ19MSJBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P7HYZ19MSJBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a versatile surge protector, but it's also pretty huge--not at all inconspicuous. It measures just over 11"" x 4"". Many electronic items continue to draw electricity when they are off. This surge protector has 3 standard non-contolled outlets, a master outlet, and four additional outlets that are controlled by the item plugged into the master outlet. When the item plugged into the master outlet it turned off, energy is completely cut off the the other four items in the controlled outlets. This enables you to save the cost of the electricty normally used by other items when they are on standby mode, which could be only a dollar a year for something that uses little power, but could be a great deal for something like a large screen which might use more than $35/year.

That would put in in a range more comparable to other dolls available at brick and mortar stores.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RERH64V692VML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T68Q34E#wasThisHelpful","RERH64V692VML","A9KLAL1CXZ0W5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9KLAL1CXZ0W5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My hair definitely feels lighter--it is amazing how much weight other styling products add to my fine hair, so the lighter feel is definitely nice. This shampoo is pleasantly and very mildly scented.

"I'm a big fan of George Foreman grills and this one is no exception. This one has removable ceramic-coated grilling plates which is a huge improvement for me--no more awkward washing of the grill plates. They come out easily and go straight in the dishwasher. They then reattach effortlessly and securely. And with the ceramic coating, I have no more worries that I have had with other coatings that can leach chemicals into the food. I'm very happy with both of these improvements.This grill can easily accommodate 6 servings, which is nice for a family. The heat level is controlled by a slicing lever from low to high. Set on the low--or minimum--setting, it cooks at between 300 and 325 degrees. On high--or maximum--setting, it cooks at between 365-400 degrees.Overall, I am thrilled with the advantages of this product, but there are two things I don't like quite as well. The ceramic plates don't give a very crispy coating on the grilled food. To me that makes it not as flavorful and appealing. Also, the drip tray is only a quarter of an inch deep! I cooked one turkey burger and 2 lean burgers on this and the drippings got all over the counter. I wasn't too pleased with that. For this reason, I gave this grill 4 stars instead of 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26HV2TNM7FSDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","R26HV2TNM7FSDB","A9KLAL1CXZ0W5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9KLAL1CXZ0W5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these Calphalon Classic Stainless Steel 8 inch and 10 inch frying pans. They look fabulous and when used and maintained properly can easily be made non-stick by heating some oil in them to the smoking point and then wiping the pan out and cooking with a small amount of fresh oil. But, don't use spray oil on these pans as it will build up. I am giving up coated pans and ordered these to try. They have a thick bottom that conducts heat well and yet they are not overly heavy.

"Great little camping lantern. I am very happy with how solidly made this is. It should hold up well to being stowed in the camping gear.The lantern is great once you figure out all of its compartments and functions. Sadly, the instructions aren't great. However, you operate the light by pulling up on the handles and the light slides out. The rechargeable batteries are in the bottom compartment, and they are replaceable if you ever need to exchange them. There is a compartment on the lid where you can put a set on non-rechargeable batteries if you ever need a backup. You access the different modes of the light (high, low, red, and red flashing) with the button that is over the charging light.I have charged it twice now and the batteries that came with it did the job. I forgot to time it the first time to see how long the light lasts, but on my second round on high, it is still going strong after 5.5 hours and it is still holding that charge two days later.Overall, this is a nifty camping accesory which puts out a low but very useable amount of light.

As hoped, the writing throughout was clever, witty, and the dialogue sparkled (even though the vampires didn't).

I think mine is going to eventually find its way into my camping kit, but it has also been great for getting rid of the young junk trees that overpopulate my yard every year.This is also great for clearing low-hanging branches but be aware that it has the same problems as any chainsaw does and can bind if what you're sawing is going to fall in the direction you're cutting from.Overall, I am very satisfied with this saw and it's ready availability in a belt pouch.  (Mymale friend isn't--he has to have a real chainsaw for every job, but I think that's down to testosterone poisoning.)I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRAEXODTQ5Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCNYJI2#wasThisHelpful","R3FRAEXODTQ5Z9","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice little light strip. I like that it doesn't come on when there is already enough light to see by, and although the instructions aren't the greatest, it's a simple enough thing to operate and install. The instructions say not to install where the is high humidity and temperature, so don't do that. The adjustable hanging bracket is fairly difficult to get open with your fingers, but it does have a nock for prying it open with screw driver or some such, so that makes it much easier.I put this up in my laundry room, where it gets extremely dark at night because the light in there is a bare bulb on a pull string that is across the room from the door. More than once I've tripped over a forgotten laundry basket on the way to turning it on. This works great for lighting my way to it and once I've got the lamp on, the light strip turns off.I like that this lamp doesn't have a rechargeable battery because I prefer to have my own batteries which I charge rather than one that makes the unit useless if it stops charging. You will need to supply four AAAs, so you don't want to put it someplace where it's going to see a lot of heavy use. But, yeah...perfect for those dark corners and also a pleasant llooking, sturdy design.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26HESOYGOO8XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SMYMY8#wasThisHelpful","R26HESOYGOO8XG","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not like you can rave about a water bottle, but this is a nice one. It's soft and smooshy, so when it's not full of water it takes up very little space. After you've suirted all the water out, you can roll it up from the bottom like a tube of toothpaste and hold the roll together with the affixed wrap. Very nicely designed. I am now using it when walking because there's a clip you can use to hang it off a belt loop. and because it's soft, it isn't annoying to have it hanging there like a hard bottle is.I was given this product in exchange for my honest review, but I would recommend it to anyone who's in the market for a sports bottle that that is easy to carry, use, and store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0K0DCC5E76K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQE9BDY#wasThisHelpful","R1L0K0DCC5E76K","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is perfect for my car emergency kit for cold Ohio winters. I constantly leave my lights on and come walking out of work late at night with a dead battery and no one around. That just isn't going to be the problem it used to be. My brain isn't entirely seive-like yet, but with the ability to provide a jump up to 30 times on one charge, I won't have to worry for an entire winter.Plus, no need to carry an emergency light. This can be used as either a flashlight or a flasher. AND, to really put the icing on the cake, it comes with a whole bunch of different power tips for charging electronic devices.All of this is held very tidily in a well-made hard-shell case.Yes, I will have to remember to charge it a couple of times a year - it does discharge some even when not used. But that's normal, not a dig on the device.I was given a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review, but I accepted the product because it looks great and is something I will use. And I'm using it, it's been charged, I've tested the lights and charging capability (phone and tablet), and I'm super-glad to have it. I have not been able to test the ""jump"" capability, but there's no reason it shouldn't work.

"Nicely made backpack purse. It doesn't have the thick straps of a backpack, and it is smaller than a student backpack, which makes it just the right size for a purse (when you need to carry a lot but not the kitchen sink, too).There are generous compartments for stowing all your stuff. In addition to the two front pockets, there is a zippered flat pocket in the back just the right size for a flat wallet for easy access but where no one would be looking for it. There are an additional two small zippered compartments on the one side and another open compartment for easy access to. I'll probably toss my sunglass case in there.The purse backpack is made of high quality, pebble-textured PU Leather. It has no smell at all like some of the PU Leather purses I've had. Has a soft, flexible feel. The flap is lined with a faux velvety fabric and the inside with a satiny fabric that has a high quality feel - it's very flexible and not plasticy-feeling.The buckles on the pockets are fake and the pocket are actually held shut with magnetic snaps. However, the pockets are not just going to pop open on their own--it actually takes quite a bit of pressure to open them. I didn't like this at first, but it's a lot more convenient that buckles for getting in and out, so I like it now.This purse is going to see a lot of use from me on casual days when I don't need the heavy duty hauler! Recommended as a quality item with a nice look. I received this purse as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. However, I'd spend the money on it, so it gets a five star from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QG56OHAZN2JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFX4WS4#wasThisHelpful","R2QG56OHAZN2JF","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the thing with this switcher: you plug it all in and it just works. No fiddling. No fussing. I had myself up and running with the three things I plugged into it (WI with adapter, DVD Player, and Fire TV Streaming Stick) with absolutely no bother at all. I did originally put the output cable in the wrong port, but a quick look at the picture in the manual got me fixed up in a jiffy. That was my problem, not the problem of the switcher!The quality of everything that plays through the switcher is the same as without the switcher (I was worry about the Fire TV stick, because that sees heavy use), but it wasn't a problem at all. The remote works as advertised. All in all, a nice product and no more switching things around in the on HDMI slot on my otherwise fantastic TV.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.

"Super-impressed with this portable light. I didn't know I could also use it as a portable charger for my iphone and other small electronics, so that was a bonus. This goes in my emergency / backwoods gear so that I can always have light and charging power if needed. At 3300 mAh, that would recharge my iphone 4s fully two times.First, it charged quickly from my PC (a few hours in the USB port) and then stayed lit overnight on high mode. So I can only imagine how much light you would get out of it on the medium or low lights. It would be perfect for camping or backpacking because it's small and easy to pack (with its own carrying case) but puts out a nice amount of useable light while. It also has a strobe function to use as an emergency signal.The final thing is that I am continually impressed with how well made Enko products are. You know how something just feels like quality when you're holding it in your hand? Yes, that. This is solid and well-made. You can just feel it. I really have become a fan of the Enko brand through being offered their products free in exchange for my honest review. This one was free, but I would absolutely not hesitate to buy the same product from them at full price. It really is good. Some of the stuff I get offered to review is crap (and I just ignore those requests because why get something free I wouldn't want?).

"Nice Apple certified charging cable. I have had a number of these (including the ones that came with my ipod and iphone), and this seems like a good sturdy cable. I find the biggest problem with all of the cables (including the Apple-manufactured cable) is that they eventually break where the cable and the plug head meet. This cable has a longer outer sheath, which I'm holding provides some additional reinforcement in those areas for a longer cable.Good, sturdy feel to the cable, so I am hoping for lots of error-free use for sync and charge, If not, I'll update my review.

"I have been looking for a lighting solution for my outdoor shed, and now I've found it. This is pretty much perfect because not only will it light things up when enter the shed, but the globe that contains the set of lights pulls out and is portable. If I need to venture deep into the shop and haven't brought an extra flashlight along, no problem. I've got one right there hanging on the wall. I can just push it back into the holder easily on my way back out. That's just darn handy.The light is designed for brief bursts of activity, so while it goes on when motion is detected, it will turn off in 35 seconds. This makes it perfect for those spots where you need intermittent light but won't be hanging around in. And, of course, if you need to extend the lighting time, you can quickly pass your hand over the front of the light and the sensor will pick up the motion and flip the lights on again.The light takes three AAA batteries which don't come with the unit. Because the light only comes on when it's needed (meaning with motion and when it's dark outside), I expect to get a pretty long period of use out of the batteries I installed. To put the batteries in, just remove the light ball from the holder and twist to remove the back.All in all, a very nice light/flashlight.I received a free sample of this product for my honest review.

"First, the great things about this pot - It is the perfect size for making two cups of two, and the dispenser action is great and works as designed. Brew the tea, set the pot on your cup, and you've got a great cup of tea in no time. Or two or three, depending on the size of your cup and how much tea you decide to brew up. You want to make only as much as you'll be using immediately unless it's an herbal you can allow to steep without flavor consequences. You can't remove the tea leaves while leaving the tea in the pot.I really wanted to give this teapot a five star review, because I know I will be using it a lot for herbal teas, and I think the design is cool. Unfortunately, I think the pot is somewhat difficult to use only because you have to make sure that you don't jiggle the bottom or set it down wonky on the tray. If you do, you could end up with tea everywhere. I get that this is user error, but let's fact it, users frequently make errors. For this reason, I will have to use it only in the kitchen instead of having it sit with me at my desk where I'd want to use it because I know I'll bump and bobble it when I'm not paying attention.Another reviewer suggested that this could easily be remedied with a locking mechanism for the bottom of the pot, and I agree. If it had that, it would definitely be ""Perfect""!Other than that, it's a great little pot and I had no problems with leaking when I was using it correctly. The first time you pull out the filter (which you pull out by the stem on the top), it can be difficult because it can be in there really tightly. I had a heck of a time with it, but it did eventually let go. subsequent removals have been painless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HGS87V6GUKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYBNUXA#wasThisHelpful","R4HGS87V6GUKU","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice little steamer. Doesn't drip or spit during steaming, which is always nice. Does what it needs to to--knocks out the wrinkles efficiently without leaving you with wet drops on the garment. The instructions are easy to read and there is a clear emphasis on how to use the steamer safely. I like to see this in my electronic items. It means the company cares about the details.The iron is a good size for traveling. You should be able to de-wrinkle an outfit quickly to be on your way without sacrificing too much valuable luggage space. The steamer won't even take up as much space as my hard-dryer does, so that's a bonus for me.

"This bluetooth headset is hands-down the most comfortable one that I have reviewed. The unique design gives you the comfort of wired earbuds (because I really don't like having all the extra pressure on my ears from the over the ear headsets) and the larger buttons are easier to manage and find. So, for design, this is a solid five stars!I find the sound quality to be pretty good. Since I've got about four different sets of bluetooth headsets now, I can actually say that I find the bass a little better with these than most of the others. No tinniness, etc. However, it's a small bluetooth speaker. Don't expect audiophile quality. However, the other headsets I've reviewed gave me a little more range before they started to skip. This is not to say that they are limited - I was over ten feet away and going around a second wall before they glitched, but I've been able to get farther than that with other sets. So, comparatively, this is a four star because of the slightly lower range.Paired immediately, no problems. Now, I personally will got for a little less range in order to have greater comfort, so overall, these are a 4.5 star for me and I am probably going to be using them more often then my cling-to-the-head bluetooth headsets.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.

"You really could not do better than this on a budget for your kitchen measuring needs. Seriously, I threw out my other junk when I got a look at how heavy duty and solid feeling these are. My others were cheap plastic and aluminum that I've managed to collect at box stores over the years, but they're gone now. Although I received this measuring set free in exchange for an honest review, if the company said, ""hey, you need to return those"", I'd be like, ""no way--here's your money"". And I am seriously cheap!So, the liquids cup is a solid, heavy glass. It appears to be comparable to my old Pyrex measuring cup (one of the few things I'm keeping from my previous collection), but it is in a two cup size. Nice! It has both metric and ounces, but not the standard cup markings. However, it's easy enough to remember that 8 ounces is 1 cup and go from there.Both the solids measuring cups and the set of measuring spoons are simple in style and solidly made of stainless steel. Nothing fancy here. These guys were meant to go to work! However, I quite like the way they look because they have a vintage feel to them - like what my mother cooked with.The measuring cups are particularly nice because they have a longer handle than is typical. It not only looks good, but I can see instances when I might want a longer reach (to get more easily into a deep canister, for instance). It's also just got more gripping room.Overall, really nice.

"These are very attractive mugs, and despite being metallic, they don't draw the cold or hot through to the outside with any intensity (so they are comfortable to use). This may be because they have a stainless steel lining under the copper outer layer. Although Moscow Mule mugs are traditionally meant to be all copper, I'd think that in terms of standing up to use, a sturdier lining would actually be a benefit. It is for me, at least. Who's going to be checking my mugs for their metal content, anyway? :-)I thought about giving these to my son for his extensive collection of barware (he's a bartender), but in the end, they're too nice to give up.

"I've reviewed a lot of bluetooth headsets at this point, and in terms of comfort while working out, this one is at the top of the heap so far. The style of the headset really works for me. I've worn it to the gym and while cycling, and it was comfortable and very secure. The headset is much more stylish than the blocky ones I've had in the past, and they stick out less from your head. When my hair is down, they are completely hidden. Like most headsets, you get three sizes of rubber buds so that you can find the one that works for you.The controls are easy to work if you need to pause your music (or audiobooks in my case), and the volume control is also easy if you can remember whether it's a short or long press that changes the volume rather than skips the track. I have to remind myself before I use them, but it takes half a second to reread the extremely well-written instructions booklet. Woohoo! Grammatically correct instructions that are easy to follow!I find the sound to be comparable to other bluetooth headsets in this price range and about the same as my wired earbuds. I've gotten about 20 feet away and was in another room from my ipod before there were any drop outs in the audio, so the range is good for the wireless connection. Synched immediately without any hassle.I've been able to use them for about four hours now for audio listening, and I haven't had to recharge.The headset comes with a short mini-usb charging cable and a very nice hard-shell case for storage. The case is a really nice bonus.

"Who would have thought that a video doorbell would be such a cool thing? I work from home and am frequently on the phone and can't just be putting people on hold willy-nilly while I'm working. I have a no solicitors sign, and still people beat on my door. How cool it has been to get an alert and see who it is so I don't have to respond unless it really is someone important (the gas company, a delivery, etc.)First things first: I read a lot of reviews with the doorbell that complained about this or that, but I had a really trouble-free experience. For me, the biggest problem was fitting the wire behind the doorbell so that it sat down tight against the wall. But it didn't take hours--it just took a couple of extra minutes.I strongly recommend that anyone who gets this doorbell pay attention to the minimum requirements for successful installation. If you do, I think you will be pleased.First, make sure you have an old transformer-powered doorbell which is what this can replace. You'll also need to make sure you router is up to snuff and that you broadcast your SSID (router name) so that doorbell can find it, then take your phone outside the front door to run a bandwidth test on speedtest.net to verify that your up bandwidth will be enough. If you get a couple of consistent tests that meet the speed requirement of 1.5 up (so it can upload the video through the internet and later back down to your phone), you should be good, Finally, you'll want to check that you have a compatible phone.  I accepted a sample of the doorbell in exchange for my honest review after making sure I met the system requirements. If I hadn't, I would have refused. I didn't want to be disappointed because I failed to follow instructions :-)Like I said, the installation was simple, although it does require mucking about with wires (and in my case, live ones, since I couldn't find the transformer to disconnect it while I replaced the old doorbell with my new, mucho cool one). And, of course, there are screws you'll be affixing to your house, so it takes a little bit of confidence with various tools as well as remembering not to electrocute onself. Always something to bear in mind.Installation took about an hour altogether, mostly because I put it flat against the wall the first time, waited for it to charge so I could test it, and then decided I probably needed the handy wedge to angle it up and over a bit. (The wedge was sent along with my package, but it wasn't inside the box, so it may be an additional accessory. What I'm saying is you may need to research that if you think you'll need it.)  So, anyway, I had to remove it and screw it down a second time. I think that's about the longest it would take anyone, and I wasn't working the whole time, I was waiting for it to charge up for the test.I've had it for about a week now, and I couldn't be happier with it. The video is adequate to the task (it's not cinema quality, obviously, but you should be able to make out who it is exactly at the door), and the two different lighting modes are very helpful. My front doorstep is extremely shady, and the ability to bring the exposure up a little is a big help. When someone rings the bell, I've got an alert within 2-3 seconds, and I can start the video, get on the intercom to tell whoever it is to go away, and be done with it without moving from my chair. While I haven't been away from the house much yet, I look forward to telling people to go away when I'm not even there!The sound quality is very clear, and the motion sensor doesn't go off at random stuff. Someone would need to linger around a bit to get it to respond, and that makes sense. You don't want it sending you an alert every time you go in and out.

"I've been getting a really nice assortment of Chinese teas lately, and not a single one of them has disappointed. My only experience with black teas (which, come to think, is probably why I've avoided them) has been with the kind that comes in the tea bag. Well, silly me. Black tea is great! Or, at least it is when you get a quality one like this nice Pu Erh.I have a tendency to brew teas strong, and this one works just fine either strong or a little weaker. Really delicious, and very smooth. I won't evaluate the health claims, but as far as the tastes--good stuff. In fact, I ran for a cup right after work to wind down after a tough day. I am the can of tea in the low humidity drawer of my fridge so it stays just as good for a long time.You should be able to get more than one cup out of the same batch of leaves. I always get a minimum of a second infusion that is just as strong and tasty as the first and sometimes a third, if I haven't let it sit too long in the previous go.I do like that the tea comes in a foil bag inside of the tin. It's cute as well as practical. You can leave it sitting around and it's decorative in addition to delicious.I was given a sample of this tea in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REM3IS232NH6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VW9GSL8#wasThisHelpful","REM3IS232NH6B","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am super-thrilled with this charging unit. I've had my eye on a more expensive one for a while as my bike trips get longer and longer, but I didn't pull the trigger because of the cost. Although I received this product in exchange for my honest review, I wouldn't even bat an eyelash if I'd had to pay for it. Not only do I love the functionality, but I think the price (currently listed at $119.00) is excellent.If you get on and ride immediately after putting the charger on and try to power the lights or charge a phone, you will be unjustifiably disappointed. The reason is that to provide consistent power, you need to ride for a while to get the internal battery charged up. It's hard to wait when you get a new toy (I didn't, which is how I know this), but you need to do it, or you'll get charge drop outs and low lights. Once you get that first charging ride done, the light should be reasonably bright when on the high beam, and it is really effective in blinker mode. You switch between the three options--low, high, and blink--with the button you install on the handle bar. I have another headlight, but I don't always take it with me. Having the extra light option is a bonus since what I wanted it for is the charging power.If, like me, you ride far but slow, don't worry that you won't get enough charging power out of this. I average around 8-10 miles per hour over 1.5 to 3 hour rides while using an iPhone and the Map My Fitness app with GPS, GPS sucks up battery power like there's no tomorrow. Over a three hour ride, the battery would normally quit before I'm done. Now, when I end my rides, the phone is about as charged as when I left the house. I think that's remarkable. I'm stoked that my upcoming day-long rides aren't going to leave me without the ability to make an emergency call even if I track the entire ride with GPS.The charger gives priority to the lights, so you won't be able to charge and light your way at the same time. This makes sense, since it always has to be safety first. Who wants to take a chance on the lights dropping out on a dark road just to listen to tunes longer? So, if you're not getting powered in daylight, make sure the lights aren't on.Finally, the installation process was pretty painless. The most difficult part was finding my reading glasses for that tiny, tiny writing! You may need to try a couple of the different sized flanges to get the right fit for your bike, but it's only a couple minute fix to change them out. Overall, this is a great product, and I really recommend grabbing one if you ride with your electronics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWHISELDYD5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPKM004#wasThisHelpful","R3SWHISELDYD5A","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This oolong tea is delicious. It brews to a light color and has a smooth taste. Although I use only loose teas now (had no idea what tea could actually taste like back in the day when I thought tea always came in bags), I'm not a big tea gourmet. I can't talk about woody notes, etc, but I can say that the tea smells amazing when you open the bag, and it brews up delicious. The caffeine effect is mild for this one.You don't want to pack your infuser too tight because you need to give the leaves room to expand.

"Very pleased with this bike case. I've been kitting my bike out for longer trips over the past year, and when Gear Beast offered me a free sample of this one in exchange for my honest review, I obviously had to say yes, please send it!Could not be happier with this. I've used it on a couple of rides and it is sturdily made. You always worry when you've got your expensive electronic gear just hanging out where catastrophe can strike, but I am no longer worried that the case will be knocked off the bike by anything other than a major spill. Once you get it clicked into the brackets on the bottom, it stays in place. It was easy to put on the handlebar with no tools needed. Only takes a minute.The case comes with a set of scored padding that can be removed to accommodate the size of your phone. I put an iPhone 4s in it (that's what I use for the GPS for my rides), and it fit snuggly, but this can accommodate quite a large phone - you just remove another section of the padding. That's great because I can continue to use the case no matter what size phone I get in the future. Good planning on Gear Beast's part.The case can be oriented in either portrait or landscape, so no matter how you want to view your phone, you can do it.The other thing I like is that the two zippers used for closure allow my to stick the charging cable from my new bike usb charger into the case while still keeping it closed securely so that I can charge my phone as I ride. If it only had one zipper, I wouldn't be able to use it while charging because it would be open on one side instead of being able to just snug the zippers against the cable on each side.Overall, very happy with this case and it is going to see a lot of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BULAOU0BNG8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRWHELQ#wasThisHelpful","R1BULAOU0BNG8S","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased items in the past that were promoted as ""over the door"" items but when they arrived, they could only be used if you didn't want to close the door. What's the point of having a door at all if you can't close it, right?I am happy to report that I now have a cute, really shabby-chic rack hanger over the top of my bathroom door that I have been using to hang robes, wet towels, and various assortments of clothing items. Although it is a thin metal, it is sturdy. I wouldn't hang a full backpack on it, but it is more than adequate for everything I've used it for.And, yeah, best part, I can still close the bathroom door :-)I was sent a free sample of this item in exchange for my honest review.

"This belt is excellent! You want something that can keep your valuable stuff with you when you're working out, but it also needs to be able to protect your stuff from the elements while being unobtrusive. I've been using the same old skool bum bag for years, but I knew that if this belt worked as well as it looks, I'd never do that again. When I went to the gym to lift tonight, it worked out great. I didn't worry about sweating on my phone with it so close to my body (I shorted one once during a bike ride), but it is also out of they way and non-bulky riding on my waist. I got the purple one, and it's pretty snazzy if you wear it on the outside, too.The second bag is perfect for the car keys. I'm going to love this on bike rides this summer, particularly that it's waterproof. Many thanks to Gear Beast for providing me a sample to review in exchange for my honest review.

"As a fan of Mr. Tomlinson's Sendero series, I was happy to find that I like this one just as much as I liked those books. I'm glad that he didn't suddenly adopt a cheery world view and instead stuck with what he does so well--telling a story about female heroines trying to get by in a world that is stacked against them.This novel is once again peopled by characters who are morally ambiguous at best, is well researched for the time period and setting, and rolls along with lots of action.

"Wow! I had another shower speaker that I liked, but this one is much better. It's attractive and solid-looking, and I don't worry about it getting wrecked if the suction lets loose when there's a tub full of water (not that it has, but stuff happens),The sound is good. You're obviously not going to get strong bass sound out of a small bluetooth speaker, but the treble and mid ranges are more than adequate to bathroom listening. I like that I can set up and audiobook or music and leave my phone well away from the steamy bathroom but still listen to whatever I want.The controls for the unit work well, and I had an easy time getting it to sync with my iphone. If you're one of those people who have to pick up a call wherever you are, you can now chat away from the shower, if you dare.Overall, a cool thing to have, and I would recommend it to a friend (in fact, I've already done just that to a friend who was looking for a gift for his music-loving brother).

"I liked the way this mouse worked, and It was particularly good when I used it in situations where I always try to use a mouse and really shouldn't--on my pants leg, on the bed next to me over the folds of the sheet, etc. You know--those places where you just insist on using the laptop but don't want to use the touch pad. It's great for that! Very easy to hang onto and the lack of wiring is obviously a bonus.The mouse synced up easily with my laptop, so no problems there. I've had wireless mice in the past that were iffy at best. Not so for this one.My only caveat for this is that it would have been more comfortable to use if it was slightly smaller. I don't have tiny hands, but they also aren't what you could call big. I think the mouse is probably sized perfectly for a larger hand than I have.

"Excellent money belt. The fabric and straps are well made and it is comfortable to wear--this is going to hold up to a lot of travel. I've used a money belt for travel for years, and this is an excellent replacement for my well-used previous one. This one is slightly larger, which allows just a little more width for items, something which I wished I had in my old one. Comfortable enough to sleep in if you frequent hostels and don't like to be parted from money and important papers because of that.I particularly appreciate that this money belt is a color that is unlikely to show dirt. My old flesh-toned one ended up looking pretty scroungy after a long trip of being sweated on and rummaged through. Although not many people see it, it matters to me.

I have a heavy duty laptop backpack I've been using for years and it weighs a ton. It just got replaced! Carrying a laptop is enough weight. The bag doesn't have to weigh a ton.

There are two external open side pockets perfect for holding a water bottle, and a larger zippable front pocket for pens, pencils, etc .The faux leather zipper pulls are a nice touch and the canvas fabric is sturdy.

"If you are looking for an inexpensive shower/bath speaker solution so that you can keep your electronics well away from water sources, this is a really good option.First, it paired easily with my iPhone. That's the most critical thing taken care of right there.Second, very acceptable sound quality. Bluetooth sound quality is never going to be amazing and match your big wired speakers, so understand what you're getting. Additionally, small speakers are not going to give you good bass and depth of sound. But these do a good job for the price and technology.The instructions that come with the speakers are good (but tiny,tiny!), and tell you have to control the volume, advance songs, pick up a call, etc. They're even a little easier to understand than some I've had with foreign manufacturers, so there's a bonus there.My biggest criticism of the unit is that the first time I charged it, the cover for the charging port broke off. It is attached by a very slender thread. That tiny cover is now gone for good because I didn't notice it was lost and I probably swept it up at some point and threw it away. So, you will need to take care that you also don't lose that peice.

"I was very impressed with this from the minute I took it out of the package. I mean, let's face it, it's a plastic USB drive--but it feels substantial. The plastic cutout for putting it on a keychain is solid and won't break off in five minutes like some of the previous thumb drives I've had.Surprisingly, the recording quality is very good for something so tiny. The biggest thing is that it has to be clear, and it it. I tested it from several feet away, and it picked up the sound really well. I used it to record a story outline and then plugged it in and it worked great for transcription with my Dragon Naturally Speaking.This little guy is a no-brainer for anyone who needs to be able to quickly record notes no matter where you are. I know many people use their phone for that, but the phone uses up a lot more juice to do it, whereas this device will do a lot of hours of recording before needing recharging (which you can do easily by plugging it in to the usb port on your PC). by lots, up to 15 or so. Which is nice.You do need to wait a few seconds when you turn it on before it is ready to record, but you can easily tell when it's time to talk because the light on the drive changes from red to blue. The on/off button is easy to find by sight or by feel. Overall, a simple but very useable recorder.Here is my only problem with it--it's wonderfully compact.

"I was surprised by a lot of things about these earphones. Bearing in mind that this is a small blueteeth headset, I was pleased with both the sound quality and the battery life. Since my primary use would definitely be for working out / walking, etc., they more than adequately serve that purposeFirst, using them only for music, I got 4 hours run time from the initial charge. Definitely not bad. If I had been talking on the phone, I would have expected a short period of use, because the two-way audio is more power intensive.Second, the sound quality was definitely acceptable. I've certainly had worse, even from some cheap wired earbuds. While I'm not an audiophile, it will make me crazy if the audio ends up overcompressed, and this wasn't. Obviously, you're not going to get any kind of bass range out of such a tiny speaker, but the sound wasn't tinny or excessively degraded.Call quality was acceptable. I could understand the caller, and the caller could understand me. So, there's that all important clarity factor when you're talking on the phone taken care of. The caller did say that the sound was ""boomy"" but it wasn't awful. I talk to a lot of people on the phone for my job, and I swear that half of them are calling from a tin can on a string. This didn't sound like that, apparently.The earbuds come with three different sizes of earplugs that you can try for comfort. If you find that you need it (I did), they also have a plastic loop that attaches to the earphones to help keep them on your ears. I find any kind of ear bud just the slightest bit annoying, and these were no more annoying than my normal ear buds, so if you don't find ear buds annoying, you should be just fine with these.I was able to get about 15 or so feet away from my phone without skips and drop outs, which is what I would expect from bluetooth. It doesn't have a big range, and it doesn't go through walls well. Then again, these are for excercising, so you will normally be keeping your phone or mp3 player on you or near you while you work out.Since these appear to often be on sale (currently at $11.00-18.00 depending on color), you really can't beat the price. I got mine free for an honest review, but I would recommend these. If you are an audiophile or extremely picky about your sound quality, you won't want them, but the chances of finding bluetooth audio you do like is pretty small. The technology just doesn't support really good sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXQIMS26UOVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AF1YF1Y#wasThisHelpful","RFXQIMS26UOVT","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was unsure how I was going to feel about this book, because I can be a real priss when it comes to steamy, sexy stuff in my reading material. I am also much more of an old adult than I am a New Adult, which is the correct genre for this one, but I've enjoyed the author's ""voice"" before and wanted to give it a go. I'm glad that I did.I love it when a book can make me laugh out loud! And I did that several times during Min's internal pissing and moaning about the state of her life when the solution was right there in front of her. The author has created a fun book full of good-humored angst about the pursuit of/retreat from a hot guy. The characters are really well drawn and come to life.Although it was a novella, it was exactly the right length for the story it told. Nothing was missing, and nothing was padded to try to get the length to go into novel range. If you are looking for a shortish, light read, you could do worse than give this one a a tryOverall, it was quite good fun. Too steamy for me, but the sexy parts are well-written--they didn't make me cringe or skip several pages like sexy parts often do.

If you like the smells associated with a (clean) infant, you'll be in heaven with these. The baby powder scent is great--subtle and extremely pleasant. The baby shampoo scent is also spot on, and I was actually surprised how nice it is to have it available in a scented candle. The baby blanket one also has that new baby smell, but it's hard to pin down the scent exactly--like lightly scented detergent? Whatever it is, it's a nice smell, and also subtle.Very clean burning--you don't get any soot in the flame. As far as I can tell at this stage, they are going to be very long-burning as well. I burned one for a couple of hours and the candle level barely went down.I was particularly excited that it is very easy to remove the labels. I prefer not to have the branding front and center when I have candles out for company, and some brands of candles have the label affixed so tight that you can't get them off without scrubbing. Not the case here. They are obviously designed to peel away without leaving glue. Nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZUS91M01RB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR8MRF8#wasThisHelpful","R2BZUS91M01RB6","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, this disc is very solidly made of thick, durable plastic. No complaints there. Unless you plan on using it over broken glass, it's going to hold up. The spines are also great, because they prevent the disc from wandering out from under you while it's in use. That in itself is an excellent feature to improve safety when using the disc.The hand pump was a nice addition (it would have been depressing to be unable to inflate it when it arrived since I don't have a ball pump), but it is definitely not the best choice for inflation.  The pump is as solidly made as the disc, and it includes the needle to add to the pump for filling the disc. However, it takes a hugely long period of time to fill the disc with this pump. So, be aware that really, you're going to want to use a basketball pump. If you've got one, this disc will be great for you right out of box.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2G0YRBC1M2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB1LLIA#wasThisHelpful","RS2G0YRBC1M2R","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this! It's my new desk chair. I've thought about getting a medicine ball to use as a replacement for my desk chair for years. I spend most of my day at one or the other of my computers, and while I also have a standing station and cycle while I work on a fitdesk, I still log way too much time sitting.The ball is nice and firm, and it's bearing up well under long periods of use under a substantial amount of weight. It is keeping my back and neck nice and destressed as I hoped it would, so I couldn't be happier. There are a number of medicine balls sold as chairs that have a base to set on, but I like that mine can roll a bit. You certainly don't need the base for stability (unless your balance is atrocious), and I think it might even negate some of the benefit to your core muscles if you immobilize the ball that.I was also happy with the foot pump included with the ball. Although it does look a bit flimsy, it got the job done just fine. The ball also came with an extra plug for the fill hole. The manufacturer is apparently planning ahead for when you lose the first one :-)I was offered this product in exchange for my honest review, but I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it after having had the opportunity to check it out. If it stays at such a good price, there's a very strong possibility my best friend will be the proud owner of one come the holiday gifting season.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4TULY3HQCQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LES2ADC#wasThisHelpful","R1L4TULY3HQCQN","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very pleased with this radar detector. I have never used one before, so I forced an expert to come along with me during my first drive and he advised me on the ins and outs of different kinds of radar and what they probably mean. With the K band, which the C1 and C2 city settings mostly filter out, I was never able to identify what set it off. My expert advised me that it was likely to be garage doors but that some smaller cities still use the K band radar for other things (like those signs that tell you how fast you are going).Overall, I've had a good time using this detector. It has a nice sleek look which is only spoiled by the 360 laser detector on the top. It's small, though, and I want to know when there's laser nearby, so no problem at all, really. The instructions that come with the detector have everything you need to know about how to use the detector, and they are in easy to read. The buttons are well-placed, and the display is easy to read. You even have the option to dim it for night driving, which would be a handy feature.I was a little surprised by how this caused me to be more aware of my overall driving. I do have a tendency to space out, and when it beeped, I had to check out the kind of radar/laser detected and check my speed. Awareness when driving is a good thing!Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a solid, useable radar detector, you probably can't go wrong with this one.I got a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPKSY0S64O2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAFW336#wasThisHelpful","RZPKSY0S64O2B","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A while ago, I read a nicely written short story by K M Weiland, so I didn't hesitate at the opportunity to receive a free copy of Behold The Dawn in exchange for an honest review. What I didn't pay attention to before grabbing it was that it's marked as a Christian book. I was looking forward to reading something set during the time of King Richard's crusade, but I'm not a Christian. I seldom enjoy Christian literature because it is often more intent on converting me than entertaining or educating me.I was pleasantly surprised when I ended up really enjoying the book. It kept usurping the place of the other four or so books I'm reading. While the main conflict of the book is an internal one between a man and his god, there was an action-packed story framed around that conflict, and the book didn't preach.The protagonist, Marcus Annan, is a well-drawn character with a way of thinking and a need for forgiveness that fits well with history. The bodies needed to fuel the fire of the Crusades were often supplied by men seeking a guarantee of absolution of their sins.Throughout, the book rolled right along with lots of action inter-cut with romance. The characters were well-developed with believable villains, and the author included a less serious sidekick (Marek) who served the story well by providing a much-needed break from the grim reality of the story.It is important to note that Behold The Dawn is not Historical Literary Fiction but *Historical* and *Romance* in approximately equal measure. The aspect I enjoyed the most was the fast-paced action that wrapped around the elements. Be aware of what you're getting, and you should also be satisfied with this book.Because this is clearly genre fiction and not for the reader of the ""serious"" historical novel, I have no problem giving the book a 4.25 star rating against other books in the genre. What keeps it from being a five star for me is that the author's formula sometimes shows through just a little too much, most notably in the romance portions of the book. However, if you like Romance novels, that would obviously be a bonus. Additionally, some of the story elements were a little too predictable.I recommend this book for people who enjoy Historical Romance or Historical Action / Adventure with romantic elements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20JUAWQPYOPY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00332FJEO#wasThisHelpful","R20JUAWQPYOPY3","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea that finally taking the plunge and upgrading to a DSLR would require so much study. But this ""for dummies"" book got me up to speed quickly, so it's gotten fun a lot faster than if I'd had to flail around on my own.I found the book to be well written, well organized, and contained all of the basics and a few of the higher level tips I needed to feel confident in my picture taking.

"I give this French Press 4.5 stars. For looks, it gets a definite five star. The modern design is nice, and because the outer covering is made of plastic, it is also lighter weight than a metal carafe. The outer covering should keep me from breaking it a little longer than I last with glass, so that is also a nice bonus for someone as clumsy as I am.The press functions as it should and comes with adequate directions if you are a first-timer making coffee the french press way, so it makes a terrific cup of coffee.My only criticism is that it was very difficult to remove the screen for cleanup. I eventually used a pair of vice grips to get it started, and I won't be screwing it back on as tight as it started out, so it's only a problem once. This may be where other people have complained about stripping the screw-on plunger handle. Because if you accidently unscrew it when trying to remove the screen (it's a lot easier to hold onto a handle than a thin metal rod when twisting), it could strip if overtightened. So, basically, don't do that: get the vice grips or pliers out if the screen assembly doesn't untwist easily the first time.Overall, I am very pleased with it, and I would recommend it to friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVL5G6UORBGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMJDJ5C#wasThisHelpful","R2DVL5G6UORBGK","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently went off all of my supplements for a month because while they were effective they had become an expensive habit. If you have joint pain and will try anything to try to get some relief, you know what I mean. So, I hadn't been using a glucosamine/chondroitin supplement for about two months, and my knees and feet were definitely telling me about it. I had put back my fish oil supplement first to see what it did, and I found out it wasn't effective enough on it's own.Then I was offered a free sample of this glucosamine/chondroitin/msm supplement and since it landed at just the right time, I decided to accept. Yes! I have been using it for two weeks now, and it has kicked in nicely. Knees and feet much better, thank you!I've primarily used the famous brand that advertises it's the only brand backed by research. And when I'd tried other brands, they really didn't seem to work as well as that one. This one does. Not sure why, But I'm glad it does. I particularly like that this contains MSM instead of Vitamin C like the other brand (an anti-inflammatory in itself so I was never sure if it was the expensive glucosamine/chondroitin or the inexpensive vitamin C working the magic). I also used MSM in my supplement mix separately (which I know helps with my soft-tissue pain), and now I don't need to. The fewer pills or powders I take daily, the better I like it.I recommend you try this if you're looking for relief from joint pain. I think it's probably true that glucosamine/chondroitin doesn't help with all possible sources of joint pain, but for those it benefits, this is definitely one of the ones that works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R218VS50TMJQAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQRXX5A#wasThisHelpful","R218VS50TMJQAR","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was offered a free bottle of Forskolin in exchange for an honest review, I wasn't sure I wanted to bother. There are many supplements that offer some weight loss benefits, but they usually cost more than I want to pay on an ongoing basis. However, when I saw that Forskilin is also a natural smooth muscle relaxant, I decided I'd better take them up on the offer. I am now a customer for life.So, let's not even talk about weight loss. I have lost a few pounds, but I live on a diet. Let's instead talk about Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) pain.Three days into a-once-in-the-morning dose of Forskolin the bowel pain that has been my constant companion over the past year stopped. It just stopped. It was a freaking miracle. And, as long as I remember to take it, it stays stopped. It comes back when I skip my dose. That's how I know it's not a placebo effect.The other part that I didn't even know would be a side effect is that the smooth muscle relaxant effect of Forskolin also has an impact  on urgent bladder. (Ladies of a certain age, you know what I mean.) I realized after about a week on the stuff that I was sleeping better. I was no longer getting up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom a gazillion times.Forskolin is my new ""miracle"" drug. I haven't felt this well for a long time. If you have any problem with bowel pain or urgent bladder, you need to do yourself a favor and try this. I've pestered everyone I know about using it, and some are now reporting back to me that they are also getting good results for IBS.

Very smooth to the touch (so critical when you've got your face smushed into them overnight). My only problem with them is that they are a little thin/lightweight.

"Although I initially found the book difficult to believe as it set up the premise of the ""Games Club"", I was willingly and eagerly suspending my disbelief within a few chapters as the story pulled me along into a complex game between a dangerous set of contestants who will do anything to win.Populated with characters who are sociopathic, narcissistic, and arrogant, the story makes it difficult to find anyone to root for. But who cares? The action blasts along in visually wrought scenes that would work brilliantly at the moving picture show, the story is interesting with a number of twists, and the ending is ultimately satisfying.Although the book is fast-paced, the author takes the time and care to develop the main character in all his evil glory. I had to keep reading to find out if he got his comeuppance!If you like a book where the evil characters are capable of redemption, skip this one. Raymond, the protagonist, is a real bad guy.

"I got the powdered calcium citrate because I wanted something that was more bio-available than pills. I also wanted calcium that did not contain vitamin D because I wanted to be able to control the exact amount of D I take each day. It's difficult to find wihtout the D added in, but Now foods came through on this one.The mixibility of this product is great. I put it in my juice. Can't taste a thing and it mixes in completely. It is important with calcium to remember that your body can't absorb more than 500 mg at a time, so I would recommend taking 1 1/4 teaspoon rather than the recommended 1 1/2 teaspoon which gives you 630 mg -- that extra 130 mg isn't going to be absorbed, so why waste it? Then, take your second dose at night if you are supplementing at 1000 mg / day (like most older women should be doing). Depending on your age, if you don't get much calcium from food sources, you'll probably need to add in a mid-day dose as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R380ABOEYL31OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WSG3NS#wasThisHelpful","R380ABOEYL31OV","AR1IM2H5RR5WN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR1IM2H5RR5WN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author did a great job putting words together, which is always a plus to keep me reading along. The plot was interesting with a few twists and turns, although you may catch on to a few of them before they happen. The setting and smaller characters gave a nice rural/backwoods feel to the book.I had trouble connecting with the main characters. The brother and sister were nasty to each other throughout, and just when you think they might be warming to each other, they become antagonistic again. By the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to either of them. However, if storyline is more important to you than warming to the characters, this shouldn't prevent you from reading the book.

"This is a nice accessory for the ipod and iphone, although the lanyard has a texture to it that may be uncomfortable on a bare neck for long periods. No problem if you're wearing a collar. It is also more of an issue with the heavier iPhone than with an iPod.That said, I really do like the lanyard and will continue to use it for those times I want to take a walk or engage in some other activity (mowing the lawn, etc.) and want to keep my music or audiobook to myself. The earbuds have decent sound, and I didn't have any problem with them falling out as reported by several other users.The real plus is that I don't have to worry about the earbud wires tangling or catching on something and getting pulled out of my ears. That in itself is a big benefit over free-dangling earbuds.This kind of accessory would be absolutely essential if you plan on being somewhere where dropping your phone or ipod out of your pocket would result in a real loss (boating comes to mind).If you don't need the earphones but need a no-pockets way to carry your iPhone or iPod, I actually prefered one of the other iHangies.

The rubber cord is very comfortable on a bare neck, making a better choice than the other one for wearing for longer periods if you don't have a collar (although the other one has earphones and I like it better for my iPod, so each has its benefits). I take a daily 45 minutes walk on my lunch hour at work and I no longer have to worry about dropping my phone because I have to carry it when I don't have pockets.Although I haven't used it for cycling yet, I can see this being a big help when riding, when I often want to have my phone readily available for pics along the trail. I used to tuck my phone under my bra strap, but I shorted out my last iPhone by sweating on it! The lanyard is going to be great for when I want to grab the phone quick for a picture.It is very easy to take on and off the i-device by just pressing in on the tips of the stylus.

"I'm quite pleased with this kitchen scale, particularly the tare feature that allows you to zero the scale to the bowl you have sitting on and then use that bowl for measurements. Also, the hole for hanging when not in use if a nice design element. My counter and cupboard space is already at a premium. I put up a hook for this and it has found a home where I will always know where it is but it is out of the way.I am also now using the scale's timer (the display turns off but it's still counting down and you can redisplay by the current count by tapping the timer button) as the secondary kitchen timer I've needed for a while.You will definitely want to read the directions for use so that you are aware of all the features correctly and make sure that you are using it on a clean, flat, hard surface. My old spring-loaded kitchen scale is now heading toward the trash! If you also have a small kitchen, I think you will find this not only accurate but a stylish, space-saving option.I removed 1/2 a point and give the scale a 4.5 rather than a 5 because although the scale looks great, it doesn't have a solid feel like I expected it to based on it being stainless. This does, however, make it very lightweight and very portable. Overall, it is a great little scale, and I expect to use it a lot whenever I need to weigh anything up to 11 pounds (which is often). I am also keeping this one in mind for a birthday present for a family member who does a lot of cooking but has the same old ugly spring-loaded scale I used to use.

"Whatever one thinks of Ligotti's ""philosophy"" as espoused in the unforgettable ""Conspiracy Against The Human Race"", there is no arguing with his fiction. I've been with his material for so long that it almost seems indecent for Penguin to distribute him, but I'm also happy.Along with ""Notes On the Writing of Horror"", ""Professor Nobody's Lecture"" and a few other more personal asides and theorems on the origin of horror, we have ""Grimscribe"", ""The Last Feast of Harlequin"", and, of course, ""The Frolic"", which all these years later I still find to be the proper introduction to Ligotti's absolutely dystopian, hopeless imaginative universe.There is something of the black priest in Ligotti, the lapsed Catholic running around with a set of fangs, circling his tail around the template of human meaning while peering into something else, some blacker sphere descending from our very pores: the stink of oblivion. A certain snobbery always emerges from the ""critical"" crowd regarding weird fiction which cannot apply to Ligotti's writing. It is literary and anti literary, partaking of everything and nothing all at once. There is an equal amount of Thomas Bernhard and HP Lovecraft here. Jeff Vandermeer gives a fantastic introduction reflecting a knowledge of the costs Ligotti's fiction (and non-fiction) exacts from the reader. Paradoxically, this is a joy! Absolutely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9C77T80MVUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107763#wasThisHelpful","R2K9C77T80MVUQ","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joshua Poteat's ""The Regret Histories"" has the coiled,  unwinding quality of a slinky or an onion. You love the glint of the blade he unfolds far from you, it would seem, and then she shine of it is so close you can barely see.I'm looking for a story that will lightmy way out, a star in the sycamore's grass,taken from night and nothing and limbs cutback from the wires. It is not summer,there is no mist on the streets.The yard, vacant with ivy and nest, wears brown,and the streetlights. The sycamore is the loudest tree,its bark lifting the hard wind like the saintwho prayed to the east and failed, parchmentspread on the monastery roof. Help mespelled out in supplicant ink, roaring throughclots of frost. Look at us, late winter, pulling deadbranches from the fence at night to avoid the neighbors,poison pushed under the shed for the rats.Let's surrender all illusions of spirit, because it deceives us.The spirit is not air, even in its highest form,no matter who sparks the flame.Tonight, I suffer from not knowinghow to suffer. Tomorrow will be the same.There used to be pills to cure this affliction.Early decay, feebleness of will, Wonderful Little Liver Pills.Beef, Iron and Wine for the poorest blood, for feverof the known and unknown world.The sycamore leans its branches on the telephone lines.To hear them on the phone, those manuscripts of barkbreathing the wires, does nothing for my courage.This is how you become a saint: Translate the ruins,wherever they sleep. Bloom the tulip-tree earlyand watch bees gather in the sleet. There is no abyss,no oblivioned ocean. Just a landscape, like this one,born from a river and seven hills, bones underthe hospital cobbles, ghost rope taut in the gallows.The glad bees orphan their hive, too soon and unwise.It isn't death I want, but it isn't life, either.Mr. Poteat has worked the ore from his dreams.

"Mario Martone's ""Il giovane favoloso"" will endure as the definitive biopic of Giacomo Leopardi, Italian poet and philosopher.Hailing from Recanati, Italy, where he spent most of his shamed, unhappy life, Leopardi had a pronounced hump in his back and a deformity in his bones. Also an essayist and noted philologist, his ""philosophy"" on human existence will never be popular. I vaguely recall the translator (or author) of ""The Giacomo Leopardi Reader"" (now entirely unnecessary as the Canti and the Zibaldone have been translated) stating: ""It is not Leopardi'swork that is depressing: it is his life."" His work is mind bogglingly transcendent poetically, but I think that's a nice half-truth. His work is gorgeously depressing.Elio Germano does an Oscar turn as the sickly poet. I imagine it must have been pretty uncomfortable having to wear whatever prop was given as his hump during such intense scenes, which in turn sort of drives home how uncomfortable Leopardi's life must itself have been.Leopardi started out life as nobility, and in this sense you're watching a movie about the poor, poor lot of independently wealthy Italians during times of horrible poverty; but to him it was natural, and his domineering father ruled over everything he read, did, and wrote. He did not want him to leave Recanati.The sense of enforced seclusion, his sickliness as an adolescent and his escape into erudition are palpable in his work and equally so in this film. He is constantly ashamed before himself, and is just generally unpopular anywhere; indeed, the more praise he receives for his literary endeavors, the stranger he is to his family and friends. The unabashed pessimism of his work and his central ideas of the permanent insolubility of human suffering were certainly not popular in his time, or in any time, though the magic and power of cosmic pessimism seem a bit diluted these days because more people are into it. Leopardi would have a good (or better) time now.  He didn't have a good time.His sense of nature as ephemeral and cruel, a beautiful tapestry constructed from barbs of ""noia"" dogs him. His sense of the feminine as incorruptible, sacrosanct, and not under any circumstances to be tampered with in any way betray the actual and lasting effect his background had on him. Early on in life he falls in love with a women and she dies spontaneously.The film frankly shows what his biographers hint at: that, because of his physical deformity, the women he imagined he was having romances were not sharing those feelings. Leopardi beat so hard against his cage, it would seem, that it only suffocated him more and even his travels left him with no consolation. He would die in Recanati, returning to his roots.The film suggests that one can never tell if Leopardi meant what he was saying or not. He enjoyed messing with people because they treated him with such contempt, but even especially after watching this detailed recounting of his life I think he really did.  The Zibaldone--which is so enormous as to be the equivalent of a 25 pound weight--is certainly proof of a disciplined conviction.  Leopardi believed, as his character whispers to his brother in the film as a youth, that ""doubt was the root of knowledge"".There should be more *well made* movies about poets. This is the best one I've seen yet. Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32B01WYEFXS78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9Z660C#wasThisHelpful","R32B01WYEFXS78","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Celia Green (born 1935) was as skeptical as a skeptic can ever get while doubting that even skepticism is profound doubt. There is no way to exaggerate her approach. If Hume doubted the perception of a match going out, Ms. Green would have done with the whole pack in some way.Here she plunges right to the center of human existence's rumbling, fragile eye.  Her definitions of ""sanity"" and ""insanity"" are a bit dense, butshe takes you where she wants you to go.""Adolescents are known to think about metaphysics more than most people; thus thinking about metaphysics becomes associated with the negative concept 'immaturity'. If someone thinks about metaphysical problems at a later age, they are said to show signs of 'delayed adolescence'.""""It is well known that the younger people are, the less sane they are likely to be. This has led to the heavily loaded social usage of the term maturity. It iran unquestionable pro-word. Roughly speaking, the mature person is characterized by willingness to accept substitutes, compromises, and delays, particularly if these are caused by the structure of society.""""How does the person who is enjoying good mental health think and act?' the booklet asks, and proceeds toinformus, among other things, that 'He gets satisfaction from simple, every-day pleasures.'

"Particularly after seeing this masterful indie movie I will never understand why anyone joins the army.The young woman portrayed by Tajana Prka who plays a traumatized female veteran clearly suffering from (PTSD), with her incredible performance made that a larger question in my mind as the movie progressed.

I myself watch TV, have never been to Seattle, and enjoy a few Guns N Roses songs.Johnston is a singular figure in music or any other field, obviously, but the music itself is what counts, and there is something to it. A childlike ambience and lyrical superfluity combine to form a pleasantly heartbreaking (sometimes deranged) experience.""It's Over"", ""I'm a Baby (In My Universe)"", ""Running Water"", and ""Desperate Man Blues"" are a little like hearing a small child with a lifetime of musical experience working a toy piano in some archaic cathedral.

"Why is that so often successful, ""popular"" kids end up in the newspapers for horrendous crimes? Why do we feel the need to invent thematic tragedies where only one or two deranged people are at fault? David Morse's film ""The Boy"", about a 9 year old named Ted, is a sustained meditation on this subject.This film is remarkable because it doesn't try to do anything but relate a few days in the life of a young boy who is already a murderer.  He is the dark seed waiting to spring on society, but there's no menace or style to the film. Even highly unconventional films have a ""style""--found footage, independent, they all have their cinematography and a calling card. ""The Boy"" is absolute realism with none of these.Ted lives with his father (played in a low key by David Morse) in a run down motel.  Probably unwisely, he tries to give Ted something to do by telling him that if he cleans dead animals off the road he'll give him some money. Ted takes this seriously. When animals don't show up, they appear, one a bunny Ted appreciates as appealing, but is as nothing compared to his higher purpose.His father tries to throw a birthday party for Ted with a song he and his absentee mother (now supposedly in Florida, a piece of information very important to Ted) used to listen to. Ted plugs his ears and kicks things, running away. Eventually we find that Ted has her address on a postcard, and intends to get there by hook or by crook.As a result of a dead deer in the road, a very strange man with a bump on his head arrives at the motel. He's questioned by the very strange sherrif about what he's doing in town without result. He tells Ted his wife ""died in a fire"". Ted finds his weakness quickly: a box with his wife's ashes in it.However strange or odd this guy might be, you can bet he'll do less harm to society than Ted himself.David Morse's character is a working man, well intentioned, and completely ignorant of what Ted already is. He thinks Ted will inherit the motel, but does suspect he's cynical about it. Ted plays happy music and experiments with different facial expressions alone in the motel rooms, gearing himself up for something.  He spends a lot of time in a rainy junkyard filled with sharp metal tools. This is what he knows.Ted has no internet or TV. He doesn't have any cues as to how he's supposed to act, and this makes the film unique.The stranger makes the mistake of breaking a travel promise to Ted after acting like his best buddy. Ted says calmly and with absolute conviction, ""Your wife is nothing but a pile of dirt"". In a rage he chases Ted to the junkyard because he has assessed accurately that people become enraged when you say things of that nature.In short, one insult too many happen to Ted in too quick a time. They are real and severe. But Ted decides to take it to the 1 percent, a group of rich teenagers who treat him like sh*t, in a way most 9 year olds most assuredly wouldn't. However, this film is set in 1989, and children weren't sized up psychologically the same way they might be now.This movie is extremely unique. Felt kinda weird watching a 9 year old for almost two hours, but Ted isn't really a kid. There is no blame in this film. Ted's just ted.

He killed three people for screwing him in poker. I enjoyed the backdrop of the movie and the sort of quasi noir literary feel of this guy's life, but Daniel Auteil kills it for me. He's corny.

"""Blblia Longcrofta"" lingers in one's psyche in the way one's vague but magical memories of first learning about mythology in school lingers. Longcroft is an archaic town that is filled with, well, gods: gods old and new, but always vividly portrayed in their reaction and attitudes to their uncanny situations on the ground.

"Levan Gabriadze beat all his contemporaries to the punch, and did so with a sadistic flair that only a true director of the macabre could get away with.Basically (and with the other reviewer I would absolutely recommend watching this on a computer) a circle of friends are revealed to be what they are behind their facades. For all the screaming and adolescent posturing, this is a genuine morality play with virtual/supernatural judge presiding every second.A girl (and this is something that happens everyday) is cyberbullied and caught in a most unladylike pose on camera.  As a result, she kills herself (also on camera). None of this is particularly subtle until the ever sadistic  Gabriadze does exactly what the situation calls for: shows each at his or her moral core. The entity is not unsparing in it's vengeance, and all it is doing is using the terrain of virtual reality we use everyday.This is also a chilling commentary on how cavalier we are with things like Facebook and technology, and how our secrets will dethrone us eventually.The negative reviewers haven't seen to many horror movies if they hate this one so bad.

"Eric Basso's ""Revagations: A Book of Dreams"" is a work first and foremost of smothering erudition; his introduction chronicles the so called ""dream lives"" of Coleridge, Victor Hugo, and Paul Valery.  The kind of tidbits in the intro are worth the price of admission, in my opinion. Hugo really could have been a symbolist.The author's own dreams are equally as fascinating.  Possessing a sense of the urbane, cinema's childlike fantasy and immanent catastrophe, here's one that stood out for me:  Winning  I'm filling in the triangular area of an abstract drawing with black crayon on a landing in the parochial school to which I've been sent,  against my will, for summer instruction.  They have eliminated all the steps. One must slide down this chute standing up. My feet pass over the photoelectric cells  that keep you on course. At the bottom, carried outdoors by your own momentum, they hand you a long stick with a hoop attached to the other end. It pulls you forward, over the ruts of hard earth that mar the journey to the finish line, where the world's record was last set.  The only one left in the contest, I go over with several yards to spare.  First prize: over eight hundred dollars.  But I have to pay the judges a dollar for a seat at the dinner where I am to receive my prize.  February 9, 1973 This is a fairly exhaustive journal. Keeping a dream journal faithfully often leads to some considerable mental disarray, as the subconscious begins overtax. But this is the Eric Basso who managed ""The Beak Doctor"", which is now featured in the compendium ""The Weird"".  Everyone should check that out.

"Toward the end of this documentary the director shows up at Facebook CEO's (surprisingly small) house with a formal request for an interview. Zuckerberg responds, ""Are you recording?"" The director affirms that they are indeed doing just that.  Zuckerberg responds, ""Could you please not?"" When the director turns the audio off, Zuckerberg smiles, seeming relieved, and is amicable.This capsizes the documentary. If every corporate mogul who sells our third party information to the government, law enforcement--all those who want ""Total Information Awareness"" as the government termed the program initially--want people to stop hacking, want entities like Anonymous to disappear, why don't they just stop recording everything we do via relentless internet profiling, algorithmic memorization and information, even pre-arrests. There was one school teacher who was arrested because he was about to perform some street theater in London before he even showed up to do it, and a 7th grader who was intercepted by the FBI for congratulating Obama on the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.Some since the revelation of all this information have actually come out (and this is brave) to the public via the internet, saying: ""If you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to worry about?"" As is so often the case, the oppressed sing the same song as their oppressors without even knowing it: the Chief Executive of Google made the same statement when asked about, well, the general lack of privacy with Google's ""Terms and Conditions"". ""If you have nothing to hide, don't worry about us selling your decade long search engine habits.""Problem: the world is full of tons of people with tons of different viewpoints.

"Charles R. Cross did an unenviable amount of research for this book, which he's really framed as ""debunking Kurt Cobain's self-made myth"". Who really believes what musicians say about themselves anyway?It stands to reason that all of Kurt Cobain's lyrics and art have a child's imaginative quality that is almost palpable. It was during his childhood that his life was torn up and thrown away like little pieces of paper.  He was a happy little unit of a family that was functional at least on the surface. Don, his father made enough money to support the family, and Wendy, his wife, took him and his sister on regular outings. Kurt was the first to show up for ""family night"", where the family members played parcheesi and Monopoly.Soon, Wendy began seeing another man. This was when Kurt Cobain's perfect drawing was torn up and a shadow was cast over it.The two divorced, and the demoralization was not restricted to Kurt. A friend recalls a 13 year old Kurt coming home to his mom unceremoniously f**king a young Romeo on the couch. Cobain told him to get the hell out. His mother would try to make herself ""part"" of his teenage parties, something Cobain couldn't equivocate with his mom when married to his father.  He moved in with his father on the condition that his father never remarry. That didn't last.From here, the Kurt Cobain that the world would come to know was slowly born. The school he once attended, where he was well known and popular had to be left behind along with every other piece of his old life: at his new school, he became withdrawn and refused to participate.His interest in punk rock skyrocketed after seeing a Sammy Hagar concert. He joined the wrestling team and got to the top of the pyramid.When his father showed up to watch him became wrestling champion, he was infuriated that Kurt lost; not only that, but that he lost willingly while looking in his father's eyes.Kurt began dropping acid and drinking a lot, becoming increasingly cynical while *still* believing the family would regroup. What is noted by all of his friends is his obsession with death, and how he talked about it with the matter-of-factness another person might possess talking about fixing a spark plug. He never slept under a bridge, but the truth is a little more depressing: he slept in a cardboard refrigerator box in the ventilating system of an abandoned building.  He also became the janitor at the school where he'd dropped out while everyone was still graduating.Humiliation is the watchword of Cobain's life. Music was his salvation but his aggravated depression (made worse by a suicidal heroin habit) did not allow his art to save him. He never committed himself to any person or situation (except in the case of Courtney Love, who knew how to prey on his need/fear dilemma, though she's not the demon people make her out to be) because there was always a chance it would disappear or hurt him.  Kurt Cobain *never* wanted to be a small-yet-famous band like the Melvins. He always knew where up was and down was--probably because he had experienced poverty.This is a hard one to ingest, even for a rock star biography. It it is really, really incredible he was able to do what was he able to do while his circumstances were what they were--to become a musician as he did.It'd be nice to see Charles R. Cross or someone do a biography of Layne Staley. I always liked AIC better than Nirvana personally and it sounds like Staley has an interesting story, so why not?  By this time?Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I3FD0YKUK6OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786884029#wasThisHelpful","R1I3FD0YKUK6OP","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Deep Cover"" is one of the most excrutiatingly honest portrayals of ""The War on Drugs"" that I've seen. Indeed, the intensity and accuracy of this movie is at times disconcerting and a bit disillusioning, which I suspect is why it never had a huge fan base. In the tradition of ""Sugar Hill"" or some of the other raw portraits of urban life in the 90's, Lawrence Fishburne and Jeff Goldblum's performances are so mint that the movie's excesses are all believable. More than anything else, this shows how one culture poisons another and every race eventually gets involved in the general garbage, handshaking, and corruption.  And it doesn't get much more direct in that arena than narcotics dealing and use.Lawrence Fishburne plays Russell Stevens Jr., a puritanical beat cop who is pulled in by DEA agent played by the impeccably nerdy Charles Martin Smith. Since Fishburne's character saw his father shot by a storeowner on Christmas as a child, he is very inhibited;  Smith's characters urges him to use his repressed vices in the undercover world.And he does so very successfully, slowly turning into a monster who doesn't mind filling his own people's communities with dope, and executing his rival drug dealer (who looks exactly like MC Hammer) in a bathroom, clearly becoming aroused from the execution. His partner in crime, David, played by Goldblum, is a successful businessman who simply enjoys being a drug dealer in his spare time, helps him grow accustomed to the bowels of the drug world.David is abused by a Serbian drug dealer constantly at their meetings; juvenile slaps in the mouth take precedence over multi million dollar drug deals. Really, why else be a criminal if you can't be a total scumbag?  David is proud of his Jewish heritage, and lives by the motto ""Never Again"": very soon the Serb finds himself executed. You don't get the sense that Fishburne's character objects all that much.  The amusing thing: this is the kind of bullish*t the DEA's watching. This nonsense.David begins wearing a big black leather trench coat and corrupting Fishburne's character more and more.  Fishburne is torn between his loyalty to David and a saintly Christian cop played by Clarence Williams III.  The scene in which he confesses to David that he's a cop is epic. In the end, it's nice to watch the movie and imagine that if Fishburne's character had filmed the dirty interactions between cops and a Noriega figure in the film, it would change the world; things like this are revealed everyday and nothing happens. A great film that deserves a re-release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TDD89AQJZE8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305505802#wasThisHelpful","R2TDD89AQJZE8Z","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With just a few false starts or longer scenes, say, with Jody's girlfriend or speculation on the Tall Man's identity, this wild ID acid trip/bad lucid dream of a movie may have been relegated to the MST3000 gallery. Indeed, there are scenes and snippets which are drop dead hilarious, like when Reggie (..played by actor Reggie Banister) asserts for the third time, head and body trembling, that he's going to ""stomp that tall f***er to the ground till he SCREAMS!""But this movie is no joke.  It has the quality of every genuinely ill, gross nightmare or too poignant a dream come to life. It is, in fact, a violating psychedelic meditation on death.The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) is the ""town undertaker"". He has some odd equipment: dwarves, small silver balls containing a siphon and two blades that run riot in his immaculately clean mausoleum. Circumspect about the timing of his ""services"", we're first introduced to the viewer when Jody (Bill Thornbury) attends a funeral.  Popping out to reprimand him for his tardiness, he looks he's 7 ft tall and barks, ""The services are BEGINNING, sir!""Though there's a backstory to the Tall Man (he's an alien who uses human bodies for a colony in another realm of space) I think he represents death. Actually I think all the films (especially this one) are emblematic of the inexorability of physical oblivion.  Mike (Michael Baldwin) is messing around with his girlfriend in a cemetery when the whole commotion starts. She stabs him in the middle of an act not showing much respect for the dead. The link between sex and death is all over this movie.  When a guy gets too relaxed with a chick, they are not preserving themselves; the fates are up to no good. Orgasm is oblivion.Jody, Mike's older brother, is the bravest but most foolhardy of the three. He wants to attack the Tall Man head on, figure out what makes him tick, destroy him, etc. It is clear things are a lot out of hand than that when Mike brings home the Tall Man's finger in a box and it has formaldehyde in it.Mike is smarter, never confronting the Tall Man head on and spending the majority of the movie running and keeping himself alive while still keeping his eye open. Smartest of all, predictably, is the eldest, Reggie, an ice cream man. He stays ignorant of the goings ons until it is impossible to ignore them; his weakness is old fashioned, simple chivalry.The funeral parlor is taking over the actual town; director Don Coscarelli does an excellent job of reversing the natural order of society and death's context. In this film it grows out, it is not insulated and ignored. And there's a bit of nasty physics going on: Mike walks into a vector space filled with purple smoke and tiny dwarves, infinitesimal creatures, the Tall Man's forbidden psychic space. He sees quite directly into the eyes of death till the elder of the tribe, Reggie, yanks him out.  For a moment, a brief moment, Jody triumphs, trapping the Tall Man in a mine shaft and keeping him there with rocks. It is a fleeting moment; it turns out the entire thing was a dream, and that Jody had died driving his car.But, as Mike looks in the mirror, the Tall Man appears on the wall. Death is present in our narcissism especially. Mike is pulled inside the false safety of his own self image, and the movie ends.Coscarelli swore never to touch this again, and he probably shouldn't have. But who could resist a greater exploration of the Tall Man? And the sequel did contain that nightmarish, sick dream feel, but not quite like this one.  A visionary experience.

"Charlie Therizon absolutely gives the performance of a lifetime as serial killer Aileen Wuornous in ""Monster"".  Christina Ricci does a spectacular turn as her lover and cohort, who eventually snitched on her.One would be hard pressed to find as difficult and tragic a life as Aileen Wuornous.  Her father was a ped who went to jail almost a few years after she was born. Her brother died of cancer not long after.A traveling prostitute born in Michigan, Wuornous started executing men in the 1990's. She posed as a hooker and carried around photographs of her fictitious ""family"", (you won't see that in the movie), gained their trust and then shot them, taking their money, and in one case unwisely retrieving a cop's nightstick and badge.  In one of the most poignant and heartrending scenes in the film, she kills a traveling rodeo Christian (this is the South, after all) who wanted only to find lodgings for her and who, incredibly enough, actually trekked the night in his car looking for desperate hitchhikers to assist.Along with this movie there's been a documentary (by Nick Broomfield of ""Kurt and Courtney"" fame), a made for TV production called ""Overkill"", and even an opera. Aileen herself benefited financially from ""Overkill"", and the staff working on Broomfield's documentary were terrified of Aileen, saying she ""had the presence of a female Charles Manson"" and that she ""pushed everyone around"".  It was Jeb Bush who signed off on her execution.As leftists sometimes we go overboard.  Everything isn't black and white, but everything isn't an ethical free for all either. I know plenty of women who have had lives comparable to Aileen Wuornous' and not a one has murdered 7 people.  It's always sad when an actor or actress gives a Capital G great performance in a film that has a somewhat misguided trajectory: ""The Hurricane"" with Denzel Washington is one of those.  The facts are all skewed and deliberately distorted in many cases to make Rubin Carter look innocent and a bigger deal than he ever was in boxing or in political activism or anything else.

"Charles Henri Ford is a too often neglected surrealist poet. Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi,[citation needed] he dropped out of high school and by age 16 he had started his first magazine, Blues(subtitled ""A Bisexual Bimonthly""). Actress Ruth Ford (1911–2009) was his sister and only known sibling.Not long after, he became part of Gertrude Stein's salon in Paris, where he met Natalie Barney, Man Ray, Kay Boyle, Janet Flanner, Peggy Guggenheim, Djuna Barnes (with whom he had an affair and travelled to Tangiers) and others of the American expatriate community in Montparnasse and Saint-Germain-des-Près. He went to Morocco in 1932 at the suggestion of Paul Bowles, and there he typed Barnes' just-completed novel, Nightwood (1936), for her.With Parker Tyler, who would later become a highly respected film critic, he co-authored The Young and Evil (1933), an energetically experimental novel with obvious debts to fellow writer Djuna Barnes, and also to Gertrude Stein, who called it ""the novel that beat the Beat Generation by a generation"". The novel portrays a collection of young genderqueer artists as they write poems, have sex, move in and out of cheap rented rooms, and duck into the neighborhood's many speakeasies. The characters' gender and sexual identities are presented candidly; it was this candor which was reportedly the reason for its rejection by several American and British publishers. It was finally picked up by Obelisk Press in Paris.Ford returned to New York City in 1934 and brought Pavel Tchelitchew (Ford's life partner until the latter's death in 1957) with him. Ford's circle at the time included Carl Van Vechten, Glenway Wescott, George Platt Lynes, Lincoln Kirstein, Orson Welles, George Balanchine, and E. E. Cummings. Visiting friends from abroad included Cecil Beaton, Leonor Fini, George Hoyningen-Huene, and Salvador Dalí. Ford was photographed by Beaton in a costume designed by Dalí for Vogue in 1937.He published his first full-length book of poems, The Garden of Disorder in 1938. William Carlos Williams wrote the introduction.[2] When Ford discussed the concept of poetry, he highlighted its relationship with other forms of art, mentioning Jean Cocteau, who wrote the foreword to one of Ford's catalogs of paintings and drawings. Ford said, ""Everything is related to the concept of poetry. As you know, Jean Cocteau used to talk about the poetry of the novel, the poetry of the essay, the poetry of the theater—everything he did, he said, was poetry. Well, he was one of my gurus."" In 1940, Ford and Tyler collaborated again on the magazine View, which was mainly concerned with avant-garde and surrealist art. It was published quarterly, as finances permitted, until 1947. It attracted contributions from such artists as Tchelitchew, Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, André Masson, Pablo Picasso, Henry Miller, Paul Klee, Albert Camus, Lawrence Durrell, Georgia O'Keeffe, Man Ray, Jorge Luis Borges, Joan Miró, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jean Genet, René Magritte, Jean Dubuffet, and Edouard Roditi.Ford was far more than a high named associate, however; his poems cut to the heart of surrealism, even if he could have used an editor.PLAINTBefore a mob of 10,000 at Owensboro, KYI, Rainey Betha, 22from the top-branch of race -hatred look at you.My limbs are bound, though boundless the bright sunlike my bright blood which had to runinto the orchard that excluded me:now I climb death's tree.The pruning hooks of many mouthscut the black-leaved boughs.The robins of my eyes hover wheresixteen leaves fall that were a prayer:sixteen mouths are open wide;the minutes like black cherriesdrop from my shady side.Oh, who is the forester must tend such a tree, Lord?Do angels pick the cherry-blood of folk like me, Lord?ST-JOHN PERSEHolding habit shaped memories in a leopard-skin apronThe bone of your left ear vibrating to stars of deep seasSt-John Perse prisoner on a lost planetYou dreamed of other existencesHad it been the wandering spirit of a jungle fighterWho entrusted you with theignitionkey to the wheel of truthYou may have discarded the ten causes of regretBut you were a sky-goerAndpaid homage toa dragoned-headed moonInstalled on the lion-throneAt the cremation grounds where, cotton-clad, we attended your last ritesGods of the world of formlessnessWhere there to participate in the mystic dramaIn your ashes I sensed no cessation of thoughtYour meanings, apparitional and boundless, added up to the sacred  number 7","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZF17UVSJKI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0872862518#wasThisHelpful","RMZF17UVSJKI3","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first listened to ""Hi, How Are You?"" in an FYE music sampling machine vendor I knew that Daniel Johnston's story would be something like this. But not this bad.Johnston was known, I guess, before Kurt Cobain wore the t-shirt of the above mentioned album at one of the MTV music awards.  Known wouldn't be quite the right word: infamous and pitied would be much better.  Some of the stories related are funny at first, and then when you reflect on them, they become very sad.  Like when the members of Sonic Youth had to chase him from a gig because he was high on LSD, believing that he had discovered a new supernatural realm, cautioning them not to under any circumstances call his parents.  Or when he ripped the key out of the ignition of his father's private jet and threw it out the window, just barely crashing in a safe manner because of his father's training. (He thought he was Casper the Friendly Ghost.)Less humorous even in this specious vein is when Daniel, psychotically high on marijuana (he shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near the music scene) beat his manager bloody with a lead pipe to ""cast his demons out"" and then dropped the other manager who had devoted most of his life to him.The Bible Belt can really mess some people up, but it and a palette of mental disturbances did a number on Daniel Johnston (he of course has the requisite talent to form all that bitterness into something worthwhile).  But does it really matter?  Even with his cult fame?  Who knows.Some of this was extraordinary, some of it was kind of ""let's laugh at the maniac"" pornography.  Anyone who listens to his music can't doubt, though, that he unearthed a new vein in sound.

"Alan Gullette's Intimations of Unreality"", both in the quality of prose and poetry, has the flavor of a dream read and remembered suddenly upon reading. ""The Door In Lheil"" is an enviable dreamscape that takes the reader through an imagined detour in the dust of an unknown planet. ""House of Morning, House of Dream"" is a gorgeously lyrical meditation on precognition, mortality and the flag of imagination unfurling in past and present lives. Gullette's poetry reminds me of Clark Ashton Smith's, only Gullette is playing more on the field of lived experience.Just on the strength of this collection alone, I personally feel Alan Gullette will eventually become a household name in the realm of weird fiction.

"Mad Season was an odd and unlikely coupling of The Screaming Trees, Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, and two members of Pearl Jam. Two shows were done at Seattle's More Theatre in 1995 of their performances; Mark Lanegan sings beautifullyin ""Long Gone Day"", he and Layne Staley and the other musicians who made this so legendary.  The playlist on the record look like this:River of DeceitLifeless Dead (live at the Moore)I Don't Know AnythingI'm AboveLong Gone DayLifeless DeadArtifical RedX-Ray MindAll AloneNovember HotelCD 1 features the original album + an unreleased acoustic instrumental titled ""Interlude,"" 3 new songs from the band's unfinished second album with newly recorded vocals and lyrics by Mark Lanegan and a remixed version of the band's John Lennon cover ""I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier.""CD 2 features the full audio set from the bands historical performance at the Moore Theater in Seattle on April 29, 1995, remastered in stereo sound.The DVD features the first official DVD release of Live at The Moore - Mad Season's last show ever performed. Not only has Live at The Moore been remixed and remastered, but newly edited by director Duncan Sharp for a beautiful new documentary-like presentation, giving the show an updated look as if the viewer were in room that night. Also included are four performances that have never been seen, including the fan-favorite ""Wake Up.""Also featured is a full concert of the bands performance from New Years Eve 1995 at RKCNDY in Seattle (which was shot by the band's crew for an up close and intimate look at the band) and both performances from Self-Pollution Radio, one newly edited.There's a rainy ambience about these songs that I've never quite heard in anything else.  ""Wake Up"" is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard, with Staley prophesying his own demise and inability to decide how to stay healthy: ""Slow suicide's no way to go/Wake up, young man, you've got to wake up..""The songs written by McCready and Barret Martin are equally beautiful.  ""X-Ray Mind"" sounds like a transmission from, well, Mars.Oh the laughs die whenOne such as I runAnd allow myselfTime for own true needsWhen convincing meThat you're on my teamMay not lie to meBut not mentioningSo sit back and haveAn hystericalLaugh at tiny holesBuy and trade men's soulsX-ray mind reads plentyWorth no more than penniesBeing an Alice In Chains fan I was surprised to notice that I liked hearing Staley sing without anyone else overdubbing or accompanying him all the time.  He had a one of a kind mix of the swampish Seattle sound and a deep baritone that could kick the song into overdrive if need be.Hearing this and watching the performances I remembered that Jerry Cantrell from AIC had replaced Staley with William Duvall, a nice guy who also can sing fairly well.  Question: why?  He talks about how he feels really ""picked on"" by the public about it and he feels he should be able to ""just play music"".  Of course. Just change the name, as band names especially have meaning.  It's one thing if people are ""picking"" on you for sh*tty reasons, and another if it's a legitimate one.I've never seen the kind of lack of respect toward a lead singer's memory as I've seen from Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney.  And let's not forget Mike Starr, one of the original guitarists being dead too! So it's hardly unreasonable to expect at least an amending of the band's name.It's really a shame. When Staley died (as people really seemed to see coming) everyone sort of laughed about it. People said roadies bet on when he would die, that his arms had fallen off, all kinds of grisly nonsense.  Because his drug use had become so horrific, people felt they had the right to just laugh and not give him the respect that Kurt Cobain must have gotten, or Eddie Vedder has. His band kind of laughed at him too, by doing what they are doing right now.But money plays a part in this as well.Anyway, to get back to the matter at hand; this is one of the best alchemical explosions of music I've ever heard. Great stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBDI2EURZ4H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQO1VYY#wasThisHelpful","R2PBDI2EURZ4H9","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daryl Cunningham is first and foremost a great cartoonist.  Nothing he draws fails to make an impression.Having the bias of knowing the author (virtually) Randians will no doubt be suspicious in advance: he's a nice guy concerned with social causes.  Which is probably why he decided to take less of a payday and pen this noble little treat on where ""the celebration of the self"" has led us: to playing with imaginary money, defunding every charitable organization known to man *at a higher level than the Reagan era*, and finally in 2008 coming real close to losing everything everyone had, whether they happened to be Santa's Helpers or have-fun-because-the-void-is-approaching nihilists dressed in all kinds of garbs.Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum (Rand's real name) was not the exemplar of her git-it-done values, and her philosophy is unrealizable because it is the fantasy world of someone who lived from the generosity of others while delivering the gospel of self sufficiency to others. (Though it's been oft repeated and ignored by her followers, Miss Rosenbaum gobbled all the SSI she could when she finally got cancer from smoking.)Only what is lived can be conveyed in real art, as Darryl Cunningham delivers it.The most successful countries on Earth do not just fund defense, police and the courts, as Rand would have it. They invest in research, education and innovation. They provide a safety net to the sick and needy. They keep defense spending in check. They protect the environment from over-exploitation. They make cuts and raise taxes, so that society’s costs and benefits are shared.  The most successful country on earth would not have had a 2008.Darryl drops a hint that now things are sort of turning around in a boomerang of attitude.  News and TV anchors have to continually remind politicians that the people at large are getting sick of this demented ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" philosophy.  The 1 percent are hated.To expose Miss Rosenbaum or Rand or whatever as what she was, he used some excellent sources Objectivists have strenuously Objected to (because they are *real* sources).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDXBRFZMJU8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419715984#wasThisHelpful","R3QDXBRFZMJU8I","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everyone except the most fortunate among us has experienced that most indelible of phenomena: a full blown nightmare with no commercial breaks or interruptions except the return of consciousness. Severe ones can leave you feeling completely exhausted.Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is as much a nightmare as David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" or even a movie like ""Clean, Shaven"" which deliberately grovels in the tomb of the psyche to gain effect.  The story actually isn't as important as the sumptuous visual feast we're treated to.  Jimmy Stewart plays John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a former police detective (who never wears a uniform, curiously enough) and is left unable to function after being responsible for the death a fellow officer.  Left hanging from a roof during a chase, he becomes something of an emotional cripple as a result of this incident,  unable to tolerate heights.The hypnagogic spools Hitchock uses to denote Ferguson's sensation of falling is perfect. If one has ever experienced anything like vertigo (or given considerable and detailed thought to the idea of falling from a very high place with no safeguard at the bottom) one gets a more than vicarious sensation of this from watching the film.  Hitchcock using the tall buildings of 1950's San Francisco to mirror John's every move is a nasty and very effective technique in showing what he's up against (indeed, what all mortals are up against every hour of every day, whether we care to admit it or not.)Kim Novak's perfomance as Madeleine Elster/""Judy"" is a very prescient commentary by Hitchcock on the way women are treated, often, in life and art: objects of men's desire and their pawns.  The funereal remaking of Judy as Madeleine is very Poe-esque.  I was continually reminded of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Ligeia"" watching this film.  Perhaps it makes sense, then, that Hitchcock was doing with Kim Novak precisely what Stewart's character is guilty of doing: demanding that she forsake all other options and career pursuits for his work and the image he wanted to fashion her in.Actually, as a nasty and effective strategy, it makes a lot of sense.""Never miss an opportunity to torture your audience"", Hitchcock once said. Indeed. The ending is so tragic, absurd, and awful that only a torturer could have imagined it. This is indeed one of the best movies I personally have ever seen.  The AFI just sets you up to be unimpressed with great works of a art.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EBLPHUPHXJRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087ZG7R0#wasThisHelpful","R2EBLPHUPHXJRQ","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He is a four-time winner of the Bram Stoker Award. He was also a finalist for the 2009 Edgar Allan Poe Award given by the Mystery Writers of America, a final nominee for the Fantasy Award, and he won the first Bram Stoker Award given in the category of ""Best Poetry Collection"".Suffering from brain cancer, his memories of his early life since boyhood take on an urgency they wouldn't have otherwise.

"The work of Barbara Ungar has what I can only term a sort of distant elegance to it; the overall impressions of her poems is someone breathing on glass, or a crystal bell being rung.  I saw her read one poem from this collection about a week ago at a ""poetry reading"".She almost has the Janus female poetic face of the dearly departed Mark Strand.  You get the same unapologetic humanism from both poets, and a deep appreciation of life's transience and fragility.  This is one of my favorites and definitely a characteristic poem:MY FATHER LOOKS AT VERMEER FOR THE LAST TIMEThe old scientist leans on his walker.His remaining eyes rheumy: what does it see?He stares toward the dim chamber342 paint-years awaywhere yellow from Dutch stained glassdraws the eye toward the astronomer's faceblurring away from ours forever, his handsleaping off the table with its astrolabeand celestial globe alive with the zodiac--The light of the mind, creamy,skins this interior murky as an uncleanedtank, an indecipherable star chartand pictures of Moses in the bulrusheshung in the muddy gloaming,the end of knowledge.  The one who set up still livesand gave his paints, who drove usto endless museums, hauls offinscrutable tortoise.  This will bethe last time we can coax him from his lairto meet his old friend,Vermeerwho so rarely stops by MinneapolisIn any case, they have nothing to sayto one another.There are many poems like this in Immortal Medusa, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes poetry--academic or non-academic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGROY055D9NTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0915380935#wasThisHelpful","RGROY055D9NTG","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Director. Luchino Visconti's film version of Camus' famous novel is excellent.  As much as it is possible to really capture Camus (his prose, when you really read it, seems too uncanny and slippery for that), this movie does it.Marcello Mastroianni plays Mersault with a quiet, intense grace and dignity that makes the rest of the world seem foolish, not his seeming disconnection from it or any kind of derealization.  I think Camus himself would have liked it, especially the beach scene where he fires those fateful shots, but who knows?  It's also an amusing movie in the sense that we see outside of the protagonist (does anyone think of him as a total anti-hero anymore?) and his environment.

"In ""The Rapist and Other Poems"", Pete Winslow (who died tragically following surgical complications at the age of 37) displays a level of sheer poetic *guts* that one rarely sees at all.  His primal emotional sincerity is well gloved in his mastery of technique but what shines above all is his love of surrealism and the surrealist quest.  He is aiming for nothing less than total subversion and with an intensity few surrealists have possessed. And, oddly enough, mortality was certainly on Winslow's mind.""THE MYSTERIOUS SEX OF TRACTORS""What a diddle, ruining a root!Barrowing under up over down and around,The agile tractor.The tree coughed incessantlyAnd could't hide its rot.Everybody's treePays the piper someday.

"The story of ""criminologist"" Jason Moss who committed suicide in 2006 after starting his own Criminal Defense law firm is a particularly grimy lesson in the costs of ambition.Prior to that Moss wrote a bestselling book, ""The Last Victim"", in which he documented his relationship with serial killers like Richard Ramirez, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Henry Lee Lucas and finally John Wayne Gacy.Being a sedentary 18 year old with the unusual goal of transcending law enforcement's forays into the psyche of these people, Svetozar Ristovski does a good job of portraying Moss as the perfectly ordinary guy who continually raises his hand in class too often not to ask questions but to ensure that everyone knows just how clever he is, who has it in his mind that he is going to do something absolutely *great* and bores everyone with the details.Moss was still a kid who needed to be watched.  Indeed, this narcissistic intellectual hatchet-man should have been watched round the clock, as he was looking for validation in, well, the wrongest of places. Creating different identities based on the victims of the murderers he corresponded with (the surface reason was that this was necessary ""for his term paper"" on the criminal mind), he finally found a formidable target in the person of John Wayne Gacy. (Kinda weird that he would choose Gacy right off the bat.  A killer with the specific MO of being interested in young guys? Like he was?)William Forsythe does a horrifyingly good job playing this monster, and at the beginning one almost roots for him; he's mowing down an arrogant little weirdo who thinks he's smarter than everyone else. Then, things get sad.  He encourages Moss to do things so abominable that the implications are sickening and cannibalizes his mind with such enthusiasm that the only truly gratifying moment in the whole movie is when Moss informs Gacy, a day before his execution, that he was never anything more than a homework assignment.Jason Moss was, in part, a victim not only of a psychopathic serial killer but the overexposure of ""Ubermensch"" Nietzschean thinking that was curiously prevalent in the 90's.  He thought of himself as a sort of intellectual Superman, ready to contend with those ""beyond good and evil"" and the rest of it. He was a bright kid who, given time, may have attained the sort of recognition he wanted. Lack of close supervision, Promethean ambition and arrogance put his brain on a veritable platter for Mr. Gacy.A great film with a similar theme would be ""Shock Corridor"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0X9T7MJPELL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G8SW3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3C0X9T7MJPELL","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Georges Franju's ""Eyes Without a Face"" is a poetic meditation on how the proverbial garbage gets dumped in a family or nation. It's also an Edgar Allan Poe-esque trip into a singularly nasty situation.Pierre Brasseur plays Doctor Génessier, a surgeon who saves his daughter Christiane and wife Louise from dying in a car accident. His performance is chilling, and is obviously meant to recall the ""banality of evil"" Arendt observed in Eichmann.  Just like a Nazi official, he considers it a normal and necessary thing to abduct female patients from his practice and remove their faces to provide a new one for Christiane (Edith Scob). His wife (Alida Valli) is just as bad, already having had a ""successful"" transplant and convinced her subtly perverted, compulsive, controlling husband will do the same for their daughter.The idea and reality of facial recognition and the nuclear family is what gives this film it's exquisitely horrible potency. Some (Christiane) in a tidy family must suffer and be shut away until their wounds are addressed for society; barring this, they must perish.  Others (the Doctor's successful experiment--his wife) reap the benefits of the world and society out of sheer contingency.  When Christiane finally does what is necessary it is as though she has unleashed the dogs of the unconscious on the world and society.  Genius filmmaking, but very difficult to stomach.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35POGG8L6UXUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZP1C4A#wasThisHelpful","R35POGG8L6UXUI","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adam Benforado is is a professor, writer, lawyer, and legal scholar. You can tell, because this book explores the grievous failings of the legal system (and it's spectators) with a thoroughness and worn, wise sensibility that one rarely finds in writers of any field.This is a disturbing book because it brings the reader's prejudices into the forefront.  Most of us, as people who maybe served on a jury and watched a lot of Law and Order, have never had to look at a defendant with any degree of impartiality or been in the most inconvenient position of having to judge a life and death situation and choose sides.Benforado points, of course, to our preconceptions and prejudices when looking at a criminal--particularly those who commit heinous crimes. And to the fact that people of societal status--which should be meaningless in a courtroom--will do 1 year for an offense that will be considered almost capital for a person of different race or economic status (the cruel fate of journalist David Rosenbaumhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rosenbaum_(journalist) is offered as a perfect example.The only thing I didn't like about the book was Benforado's attempt at a certain cognitive relativism as a replacement for actual values.

"Michael Ross, the subject of Martha Elliot's hybrid memoir/""I'll remember you"" tale of friendship with a death row inmate, was convicted of raping and murdering 8 women from 1981 - 1984.  These included adolescent girls.Martha Elliot befriended (if the reader is content to believe that friendship was all that was going on here) Michael Ross during her prestigious career as a journalist.  While writing for the Tribune she decided to interview Ross about his guilt or innocence.  For some odd reason, the interview had to be in person rather on the phone.The two hit it off famously, and a budding friendship began.  She began to study his life.  A victim of psychological abuse by his mother, he began his career of raping and murdering women in college, even though he had plenty of girlfriends.My problem with the book comes down, really, to the believability of Ross' motives when interacting with Elliot, and her almost complete lack of skepticism regarding them.She behaved almost as if she were his secretary, advocate, and something else? all at once.  So eager indeed was she to help Ross that she delivered documents and newspapers to him on a daily basis, and would immediately call him back to read to him from whatever book or article he was curious about.  Miss Elliot is a celebrated journalist for good reason and I don't intend to take any cheap shots, but not once in the entirety of this challenging text do you really get the sense that she's even raised that important question: am I being manipulated by a psychopathic rapist/murderer?We hear about his hormone therapy, his struggles in court, his willingness to ""surrender his life"" and accept the death penalty to ""satisfy the needs of the victims"".  Of course, paragraphs before, she recounts from letters he wrote which describe prison life as not worth enduring, or death being better.  He writes a lot about his suffering and displays a sort of disturbing, superficial chivalry, urging Elliot to take ""the safest flights"" to come see him, and appearing to always have his victims in mind.  (In an ""altruistic"" way, of course.)And of course with this book a prominent journalist has a sort of ""In Cold Blood"", new, exciting release and a murderer had some more free time while being in prison.  Both parties benefited.This tries to be ""Dead Man Walking"" but it isn't.  I am an opponent of the death penalty and realize that prisoners need advocates, even the most repugnant ones.  I just don't think that's what was going on here.This could be a good textbook for an Abnormal Psych class.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW639VBKRVFTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420490X#wasThisHelpful","RW639VBKRVFTJ","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My opinion: excellent razors that take off your half-stache in a second.  Reusable and flexible.detailsBIC Flex 5 is the only 5-blade disposable razor with a balancing sphere for better shave control. Five flexible blades individually adjust to the contours of the skin delivering an ultra-close shave. The razor’s  head pivots 40 enhancing shave control even more. A precision edging blade is also included in order to reach those tricky spots like under the nose or the side burns.

"William Hjortsberg's noir, Chandleresque hybrid of occult history (the book opens with the scattered, demented diagrams of a monk in the 16th century who made a pact with Satan) and old fashioned gumshoe detective thuggery is gut level disturbing.  Clearly set in the culture of the 1980's with all of it's materialism and the slow destruction of the economy, Harry Angel is a detective hired by a successful businessman and debonaire investor to collect a debt.Angel is a hardened war veteran and private detective.  At the gentle, patient prodding of his employer, Cyphre, he gets involved in the most twisted circle of cranks, psychics, ex musicians and voodoo practicing jazz musicians even the most curious mind would have trouble conjuring--Hjortsberg rises to the occasion.  This book makes one want to take a shower, particularly at it's conclusion.  The point: what you do not address will arrive at your doorstep: the casual evil you sow will come knocking, one way or another.I'm not surprised this was picked for a screenplay adaptation for the film ""Angel Heart"", though the book carries a kind of William Peter Blattyesque awfulness the movie only half-manages.

"Trying to make absolute sense of this movie is like trying to make sense of ""Mulholland Drive"" after having first seen it.  And people did that, I remember--pointing in the theatre: ""I think she had a split personality...knew it all along.""  It is a Rorschach blot with more than a couple of referents and semiotic trails, all of which are authentically horrifying.Basically, one friend shows up under the pretext of helping another friend fight his drug addiction up in the middle of nowhere, the boonies. (The director pulls something off here one doesn't usually see: he takes a nice slice of nature and makes it thoroughly appalling with the situation.)  He uses a stun gun on him and chains him to a bed--not the healthiest way to detox someone from methamphetamine or even one that would necessarily work, but this is how the film begins.Trying to help his friend through the crushing depression and physical withdrawal from the drug, narratives about why said good friend is there start to get fuzzy.  He claims his garbage pail buddy sent him some tapes of his drug abuse in a bid for help, or at least attention.  Drug addicted friend genuinely does not recall doing this.From there, oddities start to drop one by one in the lap of the ""hero"".  Dealers show up looking for money, the Native American Security force--they are on a reservation--show up and tell them to be gone in two days, and that once there was a group of archaeological students living there. A Christian millennial group explains that a being of light will descend and eat everything, including the two friends. A dog dies in front of the camp and it belonged to a Frenchman who lives nearby in a trailer.  He once taught at the Sorbonne, he explains, but prefers to study ""Man while being away from man"". He explains that one's story has only three stages: a beginning, a middle, and an end. The mirror he uses while illustrating his point is one of the keys, I think, to the movie.They are privy to how they may exit the world, because the two have somehow earned a special kind of punishment: they are allowed to see how they will die if they don't act quick.  Someone is filming them.  None of this changes the drug addict's desire to keep using drugs: he doesn't really care about his friend's soon-to-be baby, and thinks he has an ""imaginary"" view of him.  That is another key to the film.This is the best horror movie I've seen in some time and chills one right to the bone: using a sort of curse-of-theory-motif, it places the protagonists in a space where they can choose their destiny.  My personal subjective viewpoint: the good friend's buddy chose it for them.  His self destructive logic kills them both in the eyes of any mainstream viewer.  Brilliant, and I wish Hollywood would spend more money on movies like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IKYPPXJ7268/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B47NM0I#wasThisHelpful","R12IKYPPXJ7268","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maud Casey's narrative is appropriately compassionate, I think, for the subject matter: a young man who has very little continuity in his mental life and who, quite literally, just ups and leaves some very important life situations (his post in the military, for one) and then wanders into another one he can't deal with.  I'd seen scenarios like this on Unsolved Mysteries--people with amnesia and what not, and in some books by Sacks--but she really makes it come to life.

"""Starry Eyes"" with Alexandra Essoe is a near perfect synthesis of excruciatingly good acting, poetic metaphor, and a sustained meditation on the nature of ambition and evil.First you really have to appreciate the leading lady's performance, which transcends 89 percent of the acting these days.  Essoe makes her body into the vehicle for ambitious carnivorousness, decay, and a sort of awful rebirth I still fail to understand entirely.Essoe plays Sarah, a nice girl who works at a restaurant with a nice boss while pursuing an acting career. She lives with a bunch of competitive but basically nice college roommates who also aspire towards cinematic glory, just not with her inhuman fervor.She is called into an audition by ""Silver Screams"", an old horror studio that needs new blood.  During Sarah's audition, she has a genuine reaction to her inner tension which fascinates the company's talent scouts. Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer make the viewer complicit in Sarah's moral decay, flashing a camera light which forces you to look deeper and farther as she suffers through two spiritual neuterings.While I usually hate gore in movies, the transition of Sarah from nice girl to monster wouldn't have been convincing without it--and boy, is it convincing.  This was better than ""House of the Devil"", better than the ""Babadook"", just the most disturbing film I've seen in the genre. Absolutely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVS2ZD17H84I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCO69HW#wasThisHelpful","RBVS2ZD17H84I","A2HW33PQSRHLNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HW33PQSRHLNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Norah Vincent hit the proverbial nail in Woolf's coffin with this book, which beautifully reimagines the Bloomsbury Group, T.S. Eliot, her husband Leonard, and W.B. Yeats.

"Bryan Burrough, from what I've read, was a consultant for the ""Dallas Morning Journal"" and ""Vanity Fair"" and a reporter for the Wall Street Journal.  With the way he treats the cultural phenomenon of radical vs. police violence in the 1970's ( it was just insanity with no external cause and we can shake our head in wonderment and sanctimony about it)  I'm kind of surprised at his accolades.Given that he seems to know his material to a meticulous point, this makes his doe-eyed routine--""how could this happen?!""--even more offensive. Tale after tale of the Black Liberation Army and the FBI, the Weathermen, and the even the Symbionese Liberation Army are squeezed and rinsed till Mr. Burrough can be satisfied.Burrough relies on the current worship of cop and military culture to excuse police brutality, government surveillance, and the institutional thuggery which led to the demise of one of the  most significant cultural rebellions in our time.

"""Pop Goes The Weasel"" is the second of five (so far) books in the ""Helen Grace"" Crime Thrillers series. It is very well written by British author and television producer, M. J. Arlidge. He has one of the most demented minds that only the likes of the ""Saw"" movie screenwriters could have. His books are THAT twisted and gruesome. I found myself squirming more than a three year old on a sugar rush.The series is about a police detective, Helen Grace, as well as her co-workers at the Southampton police andprecinct. She prefers to be a loner on her time off, except when she visits Jake for her S & M sessions. When her arch nemesis, newspaper journalist, Emilia Garanita discovers Helen's secret, she tries to blackmail Helen into giving her exclusives in the macabre serial killer's case.What is Helen to do? Worry over her future on the task force? She has bigger fish to fry in locating the killer, who just might be the last person you would expect to take down and mutilate big men. Will Helen's undercover co-worker be one of the next victims? Only time will tell as you continue on this rollercoaster of madness. Not to worry.

"What an incredible ride! The excitement level for me is completely off the charts. It begins by introducing the neighbors in a community meeting about the strange woman who is bringing down property values and attracting vermin like crazy to her yard. We come to find out that Barcroft is a quiet bedroom community just outside of Arlington, VA. The homes back up to a deeply wooded trail with a steep drop that leads down to a stream which eventually feeds into the Potomac.Something absolutely insane happens to get your attention immediately. Someone acting as sort of ""animal control"" is called out for a ""wolf"" sighting by an old lady. Only, this person never makes it back to his vehicle. Then, the relatively new next door neighbor to the weird lady who is attracting all matter of vermin into her unkempt yard actually witnesses a mountain lion kill his huge greyhound in his very own backyard. The huge cat nearly mauls him, too, but stops just short of his throat then runs away with the dead dog flopping lifeless in his massive jowls.Things only intensify for Ben when a few neighbors meet their untimely and extremely gruesome demise. Only the local police don't pay him any mind when he tries to make sense of it all. I have never been so engrossed in a thriller/horror book like I was with this one. I found myself unable to sleep. All I could do was obsess over what was going to happen next, and is Ben safe in his own home.Bill Schweigart draws you in with his incredible knack of compassion for a character, and then zaps you with dose after dose of fear, anticipation and gruesome details. You cannot predict what is about to happen next. You may think you have it all figured out, but you are tantalizingly wrong on this non-stop thrill ride into the wickedly wild funhouse of fear. Bill's sequel, Northwoods, will be out in February, 2016. Until then, this book is worth a second or third read. You may find things you've overlooked before.

"For 30 year old Juliet, the choice was obvious, go back to living with her parents, or take a job offer from an old friend to manage a coffeehouse. She'd opt for the ladder. After all, what's the worse that could happen? She never thought her employees would despise her much less accuse her of murdering her own cook.

If she has something on her mind, no matter how raunchy, she just lets loose. It is hilarious.

"This is a joy of a book for me. Although I am not Jewish (yes, I am a Goy),  I love Yiddish. This book uses the phrases very well, which makes the dialog even better, funnier. This mystery begins after Vera Gold, who lives in the Julius and Rebecca Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors, tells her sister that someone is trying to poison her with her pills. But, she won't divulge who she thinks it may be. She also claims to have thrown the ""poison pills"" away. The very next day, Vera is found dead of ""natural causes"".Her sister refuses to call the police with her suspicions because she has no solid evidence to back up Vera's claim. So she does the next best thing. She seeks the advice of fellow residents, Rose Kaplan and Ida Berkowitz. Together, the friends have already solved one murder. They decide to talk to Vera's doctor, who is also a medical examiner.He tells them that a pathologist would have to perform an autopsy in order to find out if there was poison found in Vera's system. It is against Jewish tradition to perform an autopsy. However, it could be done with the permission of the next of kin ONLY. That would have to come from Vera's son, Daniel. But, will he agree to it?This is a wonderfully juicy cozy mystery. It is full of intrigue with a long list of suspects. The characters are richly written. It has humor, and is a great read.

If you haven't read that one (why didn't you :-), you needn't have read it as this is a great story in itself. I love Mr. Howard's books. They get better with each one! Again, this is absolutely no exception. His passion for studying the different battles of the Civil War shines through brilliantly. He is a literary wizard. He can conjure up what it must have felt like to be a part of the battle. He doesn't hold back with the graphic details, either (note to sensitive stomachs). He puts his readers smack dab right in the center of the action, And you will swear you just heard and felt a mini ball barely graze your ear. You will want to duck and take cover.This book focuses our attention on the Confederate side this time. I love that it is told in the first person by Major Chester Rigbe, a scribe for Brigadier General Bushrod R. Johnson. As such, he is expected to be close by the General a great deal of the time. Therefore, I he is privy to a great deal of chatter among the officers and passes that on to us. I always wondered what the officers were doing huddled together while watching their men fight, get wounded, or even die. Well, now is our chance to find out. Is it ever interesting!Mr. Howard's meticulous research and attention to detail in his descriptions, giving us the opportunity to feel what it was really like for the men who actually did fight in this battle,  is unsurpassed.My hope is that he will inspire a whole new generation of history buffs who just may want to pursue a career as a historian, writer or even the passionate history teacher that everyone wants, I because he or she brings history to life as Mr.Howard does right now.His gifts are utilized in the best way. Please, even if you were never interested in the Civil War, read one of these action packed, adrenalin pumping, edge-of-your-seat Blair Howard historical novels. You can test your own mettle from the safety of your reading area. You just may learn something about yourself as well.  (I was a passionate history major in college. Can you tell? Didn't think so).I was given a free copy of this book so that I could read it and give my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158QFINOQ97K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011YMZVN8#wasThisHelpful","R158QFINOQ97K5","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When punk rocker and animal activist, Kenders, is shown a charred body and is told that her husband is dead, she finds herself first in a state of shock. However, after a few times of meeting up with him in the virtual reality world of Nirvana, she tends to notice a subtle difference each time, suggesting that he is still alive and is trying to send her clues. Who can she trust to help her, if any? And, why is a psycho bitch trying to kill her?This sci-fi story has a lot going for it. It begins after the extinction of bees, that are no longer able to pollinate plant life. The world is decimated and cannot sustain life except for the dependence of a few corporations whose sole goal is to take in profits. Anyone who deviates from their plans are ""red doored"", and never seen again. There really is no true explanation regarding the red door. The book would have been better had it been elaborated on more.The story, itself, seems eerily familiar, with the loss of millions of bees each year in real life. Our planet may be without plant life or sustainable drinking water in a few decades if this keeps up. And, with big business against ordinary people, this scenario could truly happen. That makes the fear in this book more real and much more scary.I love how the heroine in this story is vulnerable yet pulls out strength and resilience from deep within when she needs to. Unable to fully determine friend from foe leaves the reader on the very edge of their seat. One can never tell which direction the story will lead next, which gives you to a true sense of vertigo, in a good way. Will life on earth ever have a favorable outcome or will big business win out in the end. The future is unclear, unless Kenders can save the day. Tune in for the next episode to find out. You'll be glad you did. Our own futures may depend on it.Thank you to Blue Moon Publishers and Netgalley for giving me an advance copy of this book to read and give my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRLIYVEANJKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LLM1XW#wasThisHelpful","R3RRLIYVEANJKB","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are a seasoned diabetic, you may have heard or read about this already. However, a refresher never hurts anyone! I wish I were handed this book when my doctor first told me I had diabetes. This is a quick and very well written book, kind of like ""Diabetes 101"".  It answers most questions I had, and others that I never thought of. It is written FOR diabetics. There is no preaching, or a list of insane exercises that are found in other books. There is great conversational advice. Mr. Davis really helps us know what may be easiest on our diabetic bodies; even multivitamins and the reason we should take them to stay healthy.

"Whenever you pick up a Blair Howard book, you can count on it being one of the very best. You may not know why until you start reading it. This book, second in the Harry Starke detective series, is no exception. This is written in the first person, as seen through Starke's eyes. But, I can't help but wonder how much detailed information isn't from Blair Howard's past. Could he have been a cop or p.I. in a prior life? How does he have so much valuable insight into the perps and their motives? And, if you are looking to read the identical book number one all over again, sorry. Although this is second in a series, it makes for one incredible stand alone mystery adventure onto itself.Mr. Howard has a way of going deeper into his characters' minds than most authors. There is a richness that gives even the most hardened criminals a touch of real humanity; even if the world would be better off without the likes of Sal Deluca or his goon, Gino, in it. Harry may be one tough hombre himself, but his softer side shows through. What I truly love most about this series is that no matter how hard you try, you never see who actually dunnit until it is finally revealed to you at the very end. The characters are each very well written, and even their often times bizarre body language still does not give it away. Another encore, please, Mr. Howard. This is one series worth singing accolades about. This book absolutely does not disappoint.I was given a free copy of this book in order to read and give my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC1116905ZOL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V14Y0S#wasThisHelpful","RC1116905ZOL1","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thank you Tim Duggan Books, Crown Publishing, Netgalley and Dr. Timothy Snyderfor giving me a free advance copy of ""Black Earth"" to read and give my honest review.In college, my history professor told my class that Hitler took what he learned from the white man's ""relentless extermination of the indigenous people of North America"" and used on the Jews in Europe. Well, it was the first and only time I have ever heard that. So, I took it with a grain of salt. Professor Snyder in his new book, ""Black Earth"". elucidates that Hitler saw Europeans as racially superior to and thereby able to conquer the Americas; which was a myth. Disease was the actual culprit.Dr. Timothy Snyder is probably the  most quintessential expert on the study of Hitler, the Holocaust, and European history in the twentieth century. In his follow-up book to ""Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin"", Dr. Snyder warns us of our own myth of seeing Hitler merely as a racist and an anti-Semite. To do so ""underestimates the potential of Nazi ideas"".He aims to explain that it was one: Hitler's desire to build a German empire comparable to the American lifestyle, or his obsession for a major land grab in order to be agriculturally viable. And, also: to destroy the state in order to justify the mass murder of Jewish people who were not citizens, and therefore considered as nonhuman,with absolutely no protection, in order to free up fertile land (black earth).Without our understanding of the past (believing a certain group of people are racially superior to another), and fear of the future (post cataclysmic:scarcity of food and water), genocide can and will be justified. One could presume, Dr. Snyder makes the assumption, that the unwarranted war in Iraq caused the destruction of the state, leaving the vulnerable region open for the infiltration of groups such as ISIS to infiltrate and take command.This, to me, makes sense. ISIS waited for civil war in Syria to be well underway before taking control within that country (after destruction of the state once again). There, they killed the men of anyone who opposed them nor shared their extreme Muslim beliefs and forced a mass exodus of Syrian citizens. So, do I believe in Dr. Snyder's thesis? Unequivocally and absolutely, I do.The book may go into too much detail for some. Others may take offense at some ambiguous examples to depict his warnings of possible future events that could bring on an ecological panic that may turn one group against another, as Hitler was able to convince the German people (and other Europeans) to go along with. However, I also believe that his unwavering attention to detail is necessary to get his point across. Within its pages are some crucial lessons that still need to be made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7NOWPKFK7TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OVQI#wasThisHelpful","R1W7NOWPKFK7TS","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I wish to thank Mr. Jeff Russell for giving me a free copy of ""Cab's Lantern"" to read so that I could give my honest review.Wow! I just finished this book and I cannot wait to read the sequel. This is an incredible story unlike any other. The setting is in the Caribbean, mostly. There are some academia within these pages. As a researcher myself, I felt giddy to read about it. This is a very intelligent book, written extremely well in layman terms so that nothing went over my head. It is a great book for most everyone.The story is about a guy who kind of gave up on himself, and decided to become a charter boat captain. Cab takes on a client. Vicki is working on her doctorate degree in marine biology. The two butt heads, puff out their chests, and try to out boss each other. To say they don't entirely see eye to eye is an understatement.Through a whirlwind of a week, the two encounter a series of anomalies, shared meals, and a few harrowing experiences. By the end of the week, both of their career choices are in question, as well as their feelings about each other. But, the book doesn't end there.What makes this story so unique is mostly deep under water. I will not even say any more. You really have to read this book in order to even believe what awaits them in the deep. It is far too good, and even a bit overwhelming to miss out on.You will develop feelings for the complex characters. Mr. Russell does a very good job of peeling back their layers. What you will find is a certain affinity for some, and a real disdain for others. The ending of this story will leave you begging for more. Mr. Russell delivers with a sequel to the story that you will want to begin as soon as you finish this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R604UV83HVDB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WOX8XG#wasThisHelpful","R604UV83HVDB8","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish I knew more about Laura Lynne Jackson before I read her good book. I really enjoyed reading her telling of how she first became aware of her gift, and how she learned to embrace it. It must have been frustrating being a teacher by day and a psychic medium by night. It really wasn't until the late twentieth century that openly talking about psychics was becoming more widely accepted. The veil between this life and the after life is getting thinner.I heard one person's critique ""Why do they on the other side always say that they are well and love us. Why don't they tell us what they do over there."" I presume it is a valid question. I would think it would be more of a personal answer. I took my mom to a local psychic once (spendy). Frank Sinatra said he was with Mom's family eating oyster soup. Mom never mentioned that. That was always their favorite food. But, Mom got very angry and yelled, ""Why is HE talking to ME? Connie likes him. I DON'T!""One more thing. Before my Grandma passed. We said we would let each other know when we get to the other side (HOME),we would let each other know. So, yes, if we watch for signs, hear certain songs or anything, our relatives, friends, and loved ones are always here. I highly recommend this beautiful book as a great gift to anyone who needs reassurance and validation. Laura Lynne Jackson wrote a beautiful book. I got so much out of it.

"Thank you Netgalley for allowing me to read this book and give my honest opinion.I had no expectations going into this book. After I finished it, I learned that this is a book based on the author, Andrea N. Carr's real life. I really liked this book. It is not written in chronological order; so the reason why the protagonist was in jail seemed to me a bit confusing. Other than that, I was involved from the very beginning and could not put it down.I wanted to know why her sister, Lady, committed suicide. I especially wanted to know why she did it in her own backyard, where she knew that her son and Angel's son (who she was caring for while Angel was in jail) would find her. Throughout the book, I could tell that Ms. Carr wrote from the heart.

"When Helen first announced her concept of an exercise book, I was elated! She has no PhD in fitness nor medicine. She is a mom like most of us, who need practical guidance. She delivers!  I read the entire book all the way through and was itching to write a review. However, in her book, Helen talks about how you should go easy the first week, then build yourself up.I had to try her workout in order to review her book honestly. Now, I can write how much I love these exercises. They are easy and painless on the joints, while strengthening my core. My body already wants to do more. But, like Helen writes, we should increase our reps gradually in order to stick with our workouts instead of doing too much and giving up.I noticed that after this first week and a half that I am not short of breath walking up my stairs. I feel less exhausted cleaning house. And, most of all, I actually look forward to my ""for me"" time. This is special care I can give myself to stay healthy, look and feel good. That makes my family happy as well.A few other things that I really love in her book: Helen talks about gradual portion reduction of meals, great snack examples, and she even added a few very delectable recipes that I have since tried. She even talks about new ways to make smoothies without all of the fuss and cleanup. Actually, there are a lot of great tips that she uses herself, on a daily basis. One of the best words of wisdom that she installs is that by showing our children how we stay healthy is to lead by example. Children look up to their parents and copy them. Taking care of ourselves also benefits our children.I was given a free copy of this book to read (and try out) in order to give my honest review. This book may be short, but it is packed with great, practical words of wisdom.

"What a great book to settle in and enjoy with a tasty beverage while being carefree.  I love this book, and I could read it over and over again. It is very good! What first drew me to it is the description of one Mr. Lewis Hart. Maddie thought that this ""ex-soldier"" was a neanderthal! I've met more than my fair share over the years. I just knew that they were going to butt heads, and I wanted a front row seat!After finding out that her beloved husband was cheating on her with her best friend (I would have seriously hurt them both), Maddie makes a hasty offer on ""Ash Cottage"". After all, she did need a place to live. That is where Lewis comes in. Ash Cottage is in desperate need of repair; and Maddie was in desperate need of a handy man. Could the duo ever ""work things out""?The book had me wincing at times (anyone who has ever had work done on their homes could attest to this). More times than not, I laughed and loved this book. It is an absolute treat to take a much needed break from reality and read about someone who seems to have it much worse than my life ever could. Plus, there is so much that I could relate to that Maddie had to endure. Hence, I found much to laugh about.I must very sincerely thank Harper Impulse UK and NetGalley for allowing me to read an advance copy of this book and to give my honest review. I really want to thank Ms. Halton for writing such a treasure. Now I have the perfect gift to buy my friends for Christmas this year. This book is a great ""after the holidays"" distressor as well!

"I must admit that I wanted knowledge from Dr. Morse's book so desperately. Then, my eyesight was nearly lost after a fall down the basement stairs, resulting in me hitting the left side of my head on the concrete floor. So, I was trying desperately to read as best as I possibly could. I fell under the ""Cinderella Syndrome"", let's call it. I became irritated, causing me to feel jaded by this book. I thought ""Great. Not another lesson on the law of attraction"".  I was about to write how I did not like the book as well as I anticipated. Then, I realized it was my attitude that was harming my happiness, not the book.I just had to endeavour to reread it again, even though Netgalley had given me a free advance copy to read so I could give an honest review. I was not in a position to meet the deadline and fell under the evil spell most Disney witches try to throw at the heroine; not that I am implying that I am. The true heroine of this story is Dr. Morse, herself. I reread the book, regardless of the fact that it would take longer than I knew was expected. But, I am delighted that I did. Because, I found out that there is another book by Dr. Morse, ""Awaiting the Fairy Godmother"", as saw through the eyes of Cinderella. This book is perceived through the eyes of the Fairy Godmother. As Dr. Morse reminds us. ""Fairytales are written for the purpose of implanting wisdom"". After all, oral storytelling used to be the norm by generations past. It was handed down from father to son, etc.What I cherished most about this book is that Dr. Morse wants us all to respond to the challenge of overcoming our complacency and stagnation, delve deep into ourselves and pull out our deepest desires. That, she says, is essential to achieve real happiness. Each chapter takes us step by step to act on our desires, doing something about becoming the happiest person you are supposed to be.What was not entirely so appetizing to me was the repetition in the book. However, that is an important tool to be learned, or at least for me. Wax on, wax off. Trust me, however, that you will come away from this book transformed into a different person with goals and ambitions, and the willingness to act on those in order to find true happiness. If it did not belong to the Fairy Godmother showing up to chat with Cinderella, and pull out her deepest desires. Cindy may still be suffering hardship and stress, working herself into exhaustion. At least, this is how Dr. Morse tells it. She wants us all to rise up and become the best people we were meant to be.I got an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in order to read and give my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJYFTOQ178UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMTI8PC#wasThisHelpful","R3DJYFTOQ178UB","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After growing up in a Penacostal Christian environment, Reba Riley became disillusioned with her church once she was old enough to seek out who she really is and what she believes in, as an individual. We all go through this stage in our lives. It is called ""growing up"". We learn to follow our own path in life, make our own decisions, and become conscientious adults. This is what I liked most about this book. It is the fact that we can all relate to her on some basic level. We have each done it. The humor is in the fact that we can see something that she writes about in our individual lives. We understand what she means, and we laugh.It is a book that is easy to digest. She doesn't preach to us or try to convince us to believe as she does. The beauty of the book is that she writes as if she were talking directly to a friend or two about her personal experiences. She writes about feeling sick at even the thought of stepping foot into a church. She discovers that she has a chronic illness, which leads her to challenge herself to visit 30 ""religions"" before she turned 30 years old (now at the age of 29).What I don't understand about the book is that many of those ""religions"" are actually different denominations of ""Christianity"". To me, that is one religion. She goes to seek out her truth while doing so. What she finds out may surprise some of us, or it may confirm our individual truths. No matter what constitutes religion is not necessarily the issue. The issue is that she discovers something about herself that is best left to each reader to determine for ourselves.We all may hold different interpretations. So, I won't even begin to send out a spoiler alert on this one. I believe each of us will gain a whole new perspective on life, or at least get something out of the book.

"This wig is worth its weight in gold. I am 50 years old, and started losing my hair over the summer. Finally, I chopped it all close to my scalp and wanted a wig. I bought one cheap wig and one that cost much more. The cheaper priced ones seem to be the best fitting and easier to care for. This wig is natural looking..... I had people who knew what I did to my head tell me that I now looked 21 years old.  I am not comfortable in wigs, but I was assured that this wig looks like my real hair. They loved it. It gave me confidence and helped my self-esteem. Plus, I have always wanted beautiful blond hair as an adult. Now I have it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZFAPA7W7ZTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBCZJOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DZFAPA7W7ZTN","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am crazy wild for Dr. Jane Ely's new book, ""Coming Into Balance"". I am going to read and work on the journaling and exercises over and over. It is incredible that she chose the Medicine wheel ""based upon the timeless universal wisdom"" and health and healing properties.I have had a life long reverence for the Lakota Nation: its culture, history, and heritage. They believe in the medicine wheel, as well. Dr. Ely's main intension is that we move through positive change toward awakened freedom."" Her style of teaching, including practices and journaling, helps us to reach that goal as long as we participate. You will love this book as much as I do.

"was just like this, only better. It was very stylish and all about one length, to the top of my shoulders. It is black hair. It is absolutely beautiful. It  looks like it was teased in the back to give it that realistic lift, as if I had just come from the salon. The feel is silky soft. It has enough shine to be radient, but not 'greasy"" looking or too much product. When wearing it, it is extremely comfortable, light, and breathable. I dare say it would be very hard to find an expensive wig that could match the elegant, attractive, and more beautiful one than this hair replacement product. I did not know there were other colors. I would absolutely love to purchase more in a variety of shades. I received compliments galore. People who knew me my whole life did double takes. They barely recognized me at first: then said I never looked so good (why thank them, I think.  Wink, Wink). A very special thank you to One One Bridal for giving me more confidence and swagger than I have had in ages. That is my true and honest review.

"I love this book about a man who never ventured too far from home, and doesn't really know that he is just existing. This sounds just like me and a whole lot of people just like me. I read a great deal about the cruise ship industry, books from veteran travelers, and books on cruise ""tips"".Just like Jim Smith, I haven't been on a real vacation in ions. Andrew Harkless knows people very well. He should. He spent a large amount of time studying human behavior by being a bartender.He said that magazines are full of celebrities. Who he wants to focus on in his books is the everyman. Most of us are an ""everyman"". We can relate to middle aged John Smith. We can see at least a small piece of ourselves in him. That is why I believe this book can really resonate with us. Mr.Harkless conveys to us, through his book,  the same lesson that Mr. Smith learns through getting out of his old reliable comfort zone and taking a cruise all by himself. When we allow ourselves to peek out of our cozy cocoons and try something scary and different, we may enjoy ourselves enough to obtain a complete metamorphosis. This is what John Smith discovered on his cruise.He experienced a whole new cruise culture that he may never had known about, otherwise. With 2,000 passengers and about 1,000 crew all aboard a small floating city together for seven days one is bound to meet some interesting people, share stories from their lives, bond, and become friends. John learns a lot about himself as much as he did about other people. He was able to spread his wings and fly. That, I believe, is what Mr. Harkless wishes for all of us. He gets his point across in a very fun and entertaining way. What is more fun and exciting than reading about a vacation upon a cruise ship. May we all get to take a cruise at least once in our lives. Live fearless and enjoy every moment of our live.I was given a free copy of this book to read and give my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HM94C0KDLGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4EJ1M6#wasThisHelpful","R22HM94C0KDLGF","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THIS IS A REAL MUST READ. Ladies, you will love it as well as me.I am one of Blair Howard's biggest fans. I love his very creative writing style. I had not known about his new detective series until I received a newsletter regarding his latest work. It said that Mr. Howard is about to release the second ""Harry Starke"" detgective ovel. I did not know there was even a first book out. I was confounded and didn't know what to expect.I had read all of Mr. Howard's historical novels, and knew of his numerous travel guides and photography books. But I was more than a bit skeptical when I first saw the book's cover. Yet by the time I got into chapter two, I was completely hooked. I had to find out what happened next.Mr. Howard always blows me away with his creative, come-to-life writing style; and yes his very cheeky, hilarious one liners. Only this book is exponentially so. I burst out laughing at ""Harry's"" personal, if not a little twisted, observations so loud that the neighbors across the street must have heard me. I can't help it. Mr. Howard is a writing genius with his shock and awe stroke of the pen.What is so special about this book to me is that it crosses genres.  It would seem like a great he-man, man cave gritty detective novel.  Nothing wrong with that. I like those. But I love that it has the mystery of Starke having to seek the clues out in order to solve the case. It uncannily resembles a good old fashioned murder mystery with a great protagonist.The reader is not privy to information that Harry doesn't yet know. We have to tag along with him, which only makes the book that much more suspenseful.  The novel feeds your anticipation, it is titilating, and it moves you along seamlessly. It entices you to want to keep reading, always luring you on to uncover the outcome with Starke. The characters are richly brewed; and Harry has to peel back their many layers.  Yet he is so in tune to human behaviors by now, he goes with his gut. And I believe that Mr. Blair Howard also goes with his, to yet again hit one out of the park. It is astonishing how well written this novel, from a completely different genre than he is known for, is. It makes me wonder if he used to be a real life Harry Sparke. It is as though he used to do that kind of work and then wrote about it. It is so exciting. I can't wait to get my hands on that second detective book.I was given a free copy of this book so that I could read it and give my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELWITIXOBAC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153VEA6K#wasThisHelpful","R3ELWITIXOBAC0","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say about the inner workings of Walter Brueggemann's mind to know his individual stance on the issue, pro or con. What I am led to believe is the question ""Does Israel, as a powerfully militarized nation today, have the right to displace all Palestinians from the land once decreed by God, in the Old Testament of the Bible, to be Israel's for all time? And, should Christians in America back Israel as much as they do just for the sake of not being called ""antisemitic ""?The biggest question that I, as a reader of his book, ask him is what's his main motive for writing this book? Is it for political reasons? Is he biased against one side, being Israel's? Is there a hidden agenda other than for humanitarian reasons that we are not privy to? Why this book, and why now?Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe he and I are on the same page. We see the news, read the papers, and fail to understand why Israel so adamantly wants no Palestinians on their soil. Is it right and ethical for current day Israel to be so heavily militarized and able to disregard the Palestinians' basic human rights?Mr. Brueggemann believes not, and tries to back his premise with the Bible. Yes, God told Moses that his were the chosen people and that Israel will be their land unconditionally. However, God later tells the Israelites that they may keep the land under one condition. They must all obey the Torah. If they do not, they basically forfeit the right to keep the land all to themselves. Many of them disobeyed God's one condition and therefore cannot claim the land strictly for themselves.Breuggmann claims that Israel's great military power, along with the backing of Christians in the U. S., are violating the Palestinians' human rights. It was not so long ago in history that the tables were turned. So why is Israel now doing the same thing to another ethnic group in their region of the world? I find myself questioning why Breuggmann is only now bringing this subject up, when peace talks failed again and again in the twentieth century?Shouldn't we now focus our attention on the genocide and human suffering that I.S.I.S. is installing onto the Syrian people? Isn't this a much larger and more heinous injustice to the Syrian people's Human Rights? National news agencies report that this is the largest mass exodus since World War II. I am no debater, nor have I ever wanted to be. I only believe that this book is just a little too little, a little too late when there are much greater (in quantity) pressing issues that we need to focus our attention on right now. Pointing fingers and blaming one religious group or nation is not going to win over the people you are trying to convince to help.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0YN023J4CM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149FP1IM#wasThisHelpful","R2C0YN023J4CM1","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first really interested in French history and culture after reading a very interesting book by a great author and scholar of Paris, Mr. David Downie. Then, I read about Hemingway's time in Paris. The trail led me to a romanticized version of one spot in particular during the German occupation: ""The Hotel on Place Vendome"" by Tilar J Mazzeo. However, I found myself with a voracious appetite for more, much more.  I had too many unanswered questions such as: why were ""ordinary"" Parisians left starving and scared to venture out of their homes. How could certain Parisian women decide to cozy up to the German Officers,  etc. Then, ""When Paris Went Dark"" found me.This has to be the most passionate and comprehensively researched and written book about Paris from the days leading up to the city of light's capture and surrender to the German army in June, I 1944, the Germain occupation and ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Jewish population, until the city's  liberation in 1944. Its  author, Ronald C. Rosbottom, did more than answer my questions. He painted a stark picture of one of the most heinous times in the history of not just Europe, but of the city of love and romance. Neighbors turning in neighbors, people attempting to flee the city before the German invasion, and those who could not afford a way out were left starving with no way to meet the most basic of other needs. It gets worse to find out that it was the Vichy French police who were crazed to beat and humiliate Jewish Parisians, and then to round them up and force them onto overcrowded trains that would transport them to death camps back east. And even though the German officers were sitting in the lap of luxury, the German troops were left to fend for themselves. They were no better off than the Parisians. They were often times polite to the city's residents. Even when Paris was liberated, fighting still continued for the rest of France and Europe. But, the biggest surprise for me was that American bombers were responsible for destroying Paris's buildings just as the Germans were.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DDKGN8HDF826/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H25FCHC#wasThisHelpful","R3DDKGN8HDF826","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew as a child that I had been reincarnated a few times. I told my Grandma once, and she scolded me and told me to never tell anyone about it. That was in the 1970's. You don't go around saying ""crazy"" stuff to anyone. But, those memories I had of reincarnation back then have never left me.What I found fascinating about this book were the children who knew in detail so many things about their past lives. And, not only that, their parents got to take them to their past life's homes and to even visit their former families.Then, too, I loved when Mr. Bullivant told us about the scientific evidence that they did not have decades ago. Things like quantum physics or proof that energy never dies. It just changes form. Could it be that the scientific community just may have the verifiable proof for reincarnation?

"I loved the way Ms.Banner wrote this book! It was told by the main character, Sarah. It is written in the first person, which I thought was brilliant for the storyline. We got to get into her head. We knew her thoughts and know about her trust issues. We also got to see how balsy she is. She is a very strong and resilient woman. And, she uses her own best judgements over that of the others.I also loved that they lived in a cul-de-sac. So the people in each of the homes pretty much became a tight community onto themselves. There are a lot of nosy neighbors; watching the comings and goings of everyone else. Sarah has her issues based on what other people were gossiping about. It is a very good book, not a true, edge of your seat kind of thriller. I view it as a daytime serial (or as it used to be called: a soap opera.) Who is doing what, and gossip to make one question their own beliefs.

"Although I haven't read ""Dream London"" or any other of Tom Ballantyne's books yet, I am very grateful to the publisher, Solaris, and also NetGalley for allowing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This is one of the most original, imaginative, funny, gory and sickening books I have read. I can't wait to read his other books.This is a continuation of where ""Dream London"" left off. Anna had marched through the parks as the Angel Tower was burning. At that time, her parents went missing with so many other Londoners. It is up to Anna to try and locate them in the Dream World. On the way to and in Dream Paris, several different people are trying to get her on their side.This is why I really love the book. She seems to almost blindly trust a stranger who holds her ""fortune scroll"" that foretells of her meeting her mom in Dream Paris. She believes him and begins her journey with an English soldier who has a backpack that he is told to keep with him at all times. He follows orders without knowing why. Why are they so either gullible or stupid not to question others' motives? All during the book, whoever they meet, I questioned whether the individuals could and should be trusted. Will we ever know for sure?Mr. Ballantyne does an excellent job of remaining consistently ambiguous throughout the entire book. I also loved that, because I never could predict what was going to happen next. Also, the book has so many unexpected surprises (not all are happy happy joy joy). My stomach lurched at some of these unexpected passages. That, too, is what makes this such an incredible, thrilling read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVDD3NC56NRPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IQQXWQ#wasThisHelpful","RVDD3NC56NRPK","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited when I read the title. Consumerism is rampantly becoming a worldwide epidemic. Even third world countries are aware of ""brands"". Our landfills are feeling the brunt of all the packaging, wasted food, and even perfectly good stuff we throw away to buy the latest thing. That having been said, I was quite a bit let down when he said he and his wife were moving to Guatemala for a year. It is easy not to buy stuff when you are far away from ""civilization"" as we know it: super centers, convenience stores on nearly every block on major roadways (not to mention McDonald's or Subway), and don't forget online shopping (Amazon being very popular).I expected an individual taking on a task just like they do on all of the now popular ""Alaska"", off the grid living, where you work hard to fend for yourself or perish. This is a man and wife who return from missionary work, have kids, and after a decade ask themselves whatever happened to the simple life in Central America. So they try their own social experiment to try to reclaim that way of life. Only, it is so much more difficult than either of them imagined.I was pleasantly surprised to read some of the silly, humorous things he says. However, what I took away from this read is that wanting and craving the newest things are not about the things themselves. It begins and can be blamed on our brains and the dopamine that is stimulated by the anticipation of, and not the actual receiving of the thing coveted.

I applaud Mr. Erdelac for writing one of the most graphic, horrific books that I have ever read. I absolutely love it.Why? There is no other comparable book that I know of. The writing is very intelligent, the details are amazing, most of the action is very graphic, and I could not tear myself from this story. Mr. Erdelac took historical fiction beyond another level!! He incorporated ancient, blood lusting supernatural beings who inhabit unsuspecting men's beings into his histororical fiction, therefore splicing two entirely different genres into a super scary nightmare.

"Netgalley gave me a free copy so that I can give my honest review.  Three sisters, all as different as could be. This makes for some squabbles and cold shoulders. However, they are family and their love for each other keeps them going.  What I liked most about this book is possibly what I didn't care so much for.Each sister takes her own path through the book. The narration distances us from the characters a bit. But so much of it is leap frogging from one sister to the next in each chapter. And, the flow for me is a bit choppy. However, it kept me unsuspecting, therefore I invested my reading into what is going to become of these three young women. What I found intriguing and different was that I could never anticipate what was coming next.Granted, it is a new perspective that doesn't bog one down with war.

"I was given a free copy of this book in order to read it and give my honest review.First, may I ask: If I were to travel to Paris, would the man of my dreams somehow approach me, and we'd be in blissful love forever?? Most of these books about Paris really want us to believe it is true. This may be little, if no, exception.First, this family of four lost their oldest and only son in a car accident. The mom is attempting to pull herself out of a deep depression. Sbe asks her newly ""independent"" daughter to go to Paris for about 3 days; then meet up with the father to go on vacaton when his plane touches down. she mentions that her son had been Paris before. Tell us about that.The whole reason she dragged her daughter to Paris was to spend quality time together, just the two of them. Also she found a letter behind a painting that she wanted to investigate to learn the history of why this man loved this young woman, but he knew they could never be together.It was a book about Paris. We can't say no to that. Otherwise the period parts of the book were very slow going, but necessary for the plot. i desperately wanted to read the book when I saw the title. I read up on the history of Montmartre and the artists who passrd through there over the decades. Yes, I enjoyed this book. But not enough to read it again, unfortunately. I DO, however, recommend anyone who loves Paris to try it. There are rarely any ""touristy"" locations mentioned. This plot could have been in Phoenix if written for that setting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IJWWB2GSBZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSACPQM#wasThisHelpful","R32IJWWB2GSBZW","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would have loved to have received my Goodreads Giveaway book so that I could read it and give my honest review. Unfortunately, the one responsible for the giveaway has not sent me a copy, nor has anyone answered my inquiry when I wrote them.This is happening more and more. If someone, I don't care who they may be, tells people that they are a ""giveaway winner"", then honor that! It really hurts potential readers to be neglected so. They tell two friends, who tell two more friends each. Soon, no one will want to purchase a book from someone who renigs on their promises.He can keep his ""free"" book, and leave it sit with all of his other nonselling books. Hoard them all. You lost one potential reader and a big fan of your show. Shouldn't he have a publicity departnent to handle book giveaways, so that ""WINNERS"" who have been notified that they are WILL ACTUALLY RECEIVE THEIR COPY?

"Unlike ""The Paris Architect"", which was written from a reluctant French Resistance agent's perspective,  this book was written from the perspective of two sisters: one who actively joined the resistance  and the other who had very little conscious  choice in the matter.  Both books had very frightening moments in them which involved sadistic,  psychopathic German officers in them. Both books talked about what life was like for occupied France and her people during the German occupation during WWII. Each of these books are wonderful works of art,  meant to take us back to a very dismal time in our world's history,  least we forget.The main thing I took away from this book is that no matter how you choose,  and what justification you tell yourself why you chose that,  your actions: all of them,  whether for good intentions  or to just survive the best you can,  have consequences.  Unless it's in hindsight,  we really have no idea of the outcome at the time that our choice is made.  Did we do the moral thing?  Were we right on snitching on our friends?  Whatever the result,  it is for the decider to live with for the rest of their lives.  We do not get off scot-free from our consciences, no matter how hard we try.That this book talks about the kind of atrocities  and torture like no other that really makes me feel a fraction of the terror that entire villages went through speaks volumes. This isn't some Disney,  watered version of the past.  This book makes sure you know just what it was really like to live and fear the German occupation  in its next door neighbor's home.  A true gift of art to keep for generations to come.  I hope this becomes required reading  in English Literature  classes throughout  the United States.  This offers a vivid account of how cruel and inhumane war actually is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZJUTQYS2BEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JO8PEN2#wasThisHelpful","R3OZJUTQYS2BEB","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seemed more like sensationalism than any real work of nonfiction.  Don't get me wrong... I am just as curious of the goings on of celebrities, now and in the past, as the next person. Parts of this book had some very juicy gossip in them. Coco Chanel was indeed one of them. Then, too, you have a ridiculously garish batch of stories about Earnest Hemingway pretending to take on the German army around Paris.I do love stories about hoteliers who have grown up there, when their parents had worked there before them.  You know that if anyone would have some important knowledge, they would (if only you could get them to talk).  With high level German occupiers in your midst,  it is better to turn a blind eye and keep your head down with your mouth shut. I may have learned a thing or two, but at what cost?The German officers and their ""new friends"" ate high off the hog and drank to excess while the average Parisian was forced to go hungry for lack of food. The American journalists seemed to be better off befriending these Germans, and partaking in all of the festivities, than to care for their own boys dying on the shores of Normandy.  For them, the ONLY destination is to get to the swankiest hotel, ever, before their colleagues do.  And,  that was the Hotel Ritz on The Place Vendome.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VDKPO5AEFDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB32R18#wasThisHelpful","R16VDKPO5AEFDD","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this book. I love Commissaire Georges Dupin most of all. He was transferred from Paris because he tended to not play well with others in the police station. Hey, getting older has its irritations. Then, right at breakfast, he gets a call to investigate a murder that took place in a little village next to the sea just as tourist season was about to begin. The man who was supposed to be heading it up was on vacation, himself. This didn't sit too well with Dupin any more than interrupting his morning coffee.He heads the fifteen or so miles to the little seaside village of Pont-Aven, on the coast of Breton, to find out why and who brutally stabbed the 91 year old, third generation hotel owner to death. Dupin doesn't seem to have time to babysit his investigative team. So he gives them very mundane tasks, while he interrogates those closest to the beloved staple of the small community, Pierre-Louis Pennec. When not engaged directly with police proceedure, he takes zen-like strolls along the riverbank that leads out to sea, or enjoys the meals only the French can prepare so well.While all this sounds so pleasant, one tends to wonder if this case will ever get solved. The book is tempting its readers to come visit the quaint artisan village and to learn of its unique history, kind of like it is trying to divert your attention away from the main storyline. This is another reason I love this book. All of the clever little diversions away from the grizzle in the meat of a police investigation keeps the reader sidetracked long enough to get near the end. All in all, it is akin to taking a working vacation to someplace pleasant one would enjoy more if work wasn't a part of it. I didn't have to put too much effort into remembering which person was which. I could go with Dupin's flow (I am as much of a stay-to-myself-person also). I believe I understand his foibles much more than other readers who are less impatient with the pace of life that Dupin seems to lead. He takes the time to smell what roses he does come across.I was given a copy of this book in order to read it and give an honest review of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESL4KJ9F1MG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQ9ST1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3ESL4KJ9F1MG3","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking to buy a folio cover for my Kindle Fire HD 7. Then, I happened upon this Poetic case. It may be a fraction of the cost of those ""show off"" brands, but it is the greatest case! It makes the colors so much more vivid, and really reduces glare. The screen protector is built in. There are covers for when you aren't charging and stuff. It is easy to grip and hold. And, it is even water resistant, in case you ever accidently splash some water on it, trying to get the lid off of your water bottle. The case colors are fun, without looking like you took your toddler's by mistake. The pros outweigh the cons (if you can even spot a con). I would like to order a few more colors to switch it up a bit when I want to.

"Thank you to NetGalley for giving me a free copy to read and give my honest review.I don't know if becoming madly passionate to want to read about a sick, twisted, kind of ""Saw"" scenario makes me a bit psycho or not. But the very moment I read the quick premise of the book, I absolutely knew I NEEDED to find out what was going on and why. And from the very beginning, this book is so enthralling, I had the insatiable desire to read it all the way through without stopping for anything.  How does a couple getting soaked in the rain end up as survival of the most heinous?I loved Helen Grace, lead detective on a series of ""games"", which pits two people against each other, starvation, doing the right thing vs. looking out for #1. What I didn't like about her character was how quick she accused her closest coworkers of conspiracy or assisting the ""killer"". And, is one truly THE murderer or just someone who makes other people slowly lose their minds and become the killer, themselves? It wasn't like one was ""holding a gun to their head"" and forcing them to choose. We all have some free will.But, this is where the book REALLY gets psychologically interesting: who is actually the most fortunate of the two hostages? The one who gets put out of their misery (not of their choosing) or the one who decides to save their own hide by killing the other person? The answer just may surprise you, the reader. You may think this is a clear case of the reader getting clues to solve the case before the ""coppers"". This brilliant author, M.J. Arlidge is way too clever to allow it to be that easy.He loves to throw curve balls at you to try to hit you in the head. He wants you to place yourself in the picture and to ask yourself just how far would you go to stay alive. Also, was your choice the right one? If you had to do it all over again, would you do it differently? This is a very good form of entertainment with a very special bonus: You will never see your friends, family, or even coworkers in the same way ever again. This will not disappoint!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12MPBI2TKHIO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF6FG#wasThisHelpful","R12MPBI2TKHIO8","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, I couldn't understand where this story was leading. Hence the four rating. Then, all at once, I am enthralled. I could not put the book down to save my skin. This Henry character is somewhat confused about his conundrum whether to tell the truth or lie. He does some incredibly bad things that he fears will land him in jail. However, it seems to me that strange circumstances tend to happen at the right time. This very enthusiastic and passionate detective tries to trip Henry up so that he can get some sort of truth out of Henry. But this supposed womanizing drifter in the beginning slowly becomes smarter and clever as the story goes on.I loved this book after it grabbed me and pulled me in. Why I feel this way is the quirky characters. The writing is brilliantly thought out. What a grand imagination to come up with a full story filled with illusions around every bend. The things that happen all around Henry are unforeseen by me, the reader. They hit me so unexpectedly, it felt like I had the wind knocked out of me. I really want to keep the suspense for you to find out on your own. It is too good a story for anyone to give it away. Does the detective ever solve his mystery? Whatever becomes of Henry? Those were the questions that kept me guessing and needing to find out to the very end. I have never read such an out of this world type of book before. I don't know of any author who used a main character to take us on an exciting roller coaster ride like this one. The narration made the book. I want to read so much more from Sascha Arango. I am still energized by this story and the people in it.I am one of the Goodreads First Reads giveaway winners.

"I came into this book thinking ""not another girl leaves boyfriend for trip to Paris. Girl meets Frenchman, then girl develops feelings for him. Boyfriend tries to bring girl home. Girl stays in France with new man. Chick lit overkill."" Am I ever so glad that I couldn't have been further from the truth (well, most of it anyway). I didn't find out that it was inspired by an actual discovery until the very end. Astonishing!To me, this book is a multifaceted gem. Cat Jordan discovers that she has inherited an apartment that has been locked up ever since 1940. Another claimant, Loic de Florian, teams up with Cat to solve a mystery of why she inherited it and not the owner's family, who were shocked to just now learn of it. He eventually gives up; however Cat's willingness to persevere pays off in the long run.""Paris Time Capsule"" fascinated me most with it's intonations. The apartment is the tangible time capsule, clearly. It had been untouched for over a half of a century. Loic takes Cat on an informational treasure hunt, for clues to his grandmother's youth, in very old buildings in very quaint villages is another. The most important one for me is what it was like to endure the loss of one's freedom, home, and possibly life once the Germans invaded France and took possession of Paris. Ms. Carey brought those hopeless days of WWII to life like no other. I was mesmerized to the very end.Thank you, Netgalley for giving me a free copy of this book to read and give an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4WPP4E7H2K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBOD5T2#wasThisHelpful","R1E4WPP4E7H2K1","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is Blair Howard's third book in the ""A Novel of the American Civil War"" series. No two books are ever alike. This book is no exception. I used to read Louis L'amour's westerns. Never in those has there been a chase like this one. It keeps you on your toes. There is always something around the next corner to keep you glued to the pages.The book starts with a gang of 23 rouge confederate soldiers,  including their demonic ""commanding officer"" , Lieutenant Jesse Quintana. This motley gang ravages a small frontier town, Echo, on the Kansas prairie. From there, they are on the run for Mexico.Word gets out to O'Sullivan (""The Mule Soldiers"") that he was to report to Colonel Richard at Fort Scott, Kansas. He was given orders ""to track down and arrest, or kill, this band of renegades"". Along with Sergeant Major Coffin, nearly right out of military school Lieutenant Warwick, a scout, and 14 troops, O'Sullivan is out on the quest of his life.One word of caution. This book is full of gore, very detailed. It may not be suited for children or sensitive people. However, Mr. Blair is making this as real as possible. There are some equally humorous parts, too. I love the level of detail in this book. It, as a whole, is extraordinary. Like his previous Civil War novels, you will feel like you are literally in the book.

"I absolutely love Mrs. Lesage's writing style! For me, it is the mix of sarcasm (just like mine, that makes my daughter yell ""shut up! You always embarrass me."" - it is SO MUCH FUN!) and humor. She always comes up with the coolest things to write about. It is as if we are sitting outside of a small coffee shop visiting, and Vicki says ""Let me tell you about the DAY I had!""I will let you in on just a couple topics she writes about. One - the Facechat she has with her Mom across the lake (isn't England the ""pond"" from America?).  Her son is telling Grandma all about his favorite topic ""caca vroom vroom"" otherwise known (but not yet to Grandma) the garbage truck. It is not only the cutest thing. Grandma doles out advice to her daughter about....... well, read the book! Do you honestly expect me to spoil it for you? While you are reading, find out why Mommy gets nervous that Grandma may find out the French word for ""seal"". That one made me roar, laughing so loud.Two - 10 things to compare living in Paris with going to the dentist (or something about the dentist). Now, instead of a second topic I love, there are actually TEN of them in one chapter alone. I could almost say ""You had to be there"". However, I have never been to Paris. I did go to the dentist (too many times as a kid).  You will find the comparisons spot on if not funny. Ah, but you WILL find them funny. Just like her others, this book will not disappoint!

"I used to buy these at a beautiful bakery. When they closed, I could never find any place that sold them (at least 30+ years now). I would search ""butter"" cookies, but they weren't it.

"I am a devoted Hay House reader. When I saw this beautiful cover and then read that it helps people grieve, I had to read this book. I believe, as Dr. Turndorf does, that if you are open to signs, you notice things. However, this Dr. stated that her husband would visit her in full apparition nearly all the time. She also said that she'd send him to her friends' homes to deliver messages to them. Has ANYONE ever had experiences like that, EVER? Even the Long Island Medium, I believe, said that she has never seen full bodied apparitions. And the friends weren't the least bit concerned that he was standing right there without first knocking or something?She falls in love with a ""married"" man twice her age. She breaks up a marriage, and brags about his ""smell (not scent, his smell.....even whiffing his armpits. I did not need to visualize that). She tells how her parents, mostly her over-opinionated mom (which of us don't have one?), would disapprove of her marriage and had been abusive to her when she was young. Is her beloved Jean a daddy fetish or was she seeking a daddy when she found him? Again, it is nothing that should concern me. But, she wrote the book.For being a t.v. Dr. who gives out advice, isn't she just a bit out there? One minute she is in hysterics, and the next she feels the ""rapture"" of the most intense love she's ever felt. But, then it is as if she is throwing a tantrum with hysterics, again. Yes, like she said, we all grieve differently. But, as a professional, couldn't she try to keep it together at least somewhat?What broke my complete reading connection with this book was the younger man who set up his massage equipment for her. Then in front of a large window, she jumps up completely nude (where a neighbor or anyone walking by could see her). The masseuse guy had to see her full frontal, and then the clincher. He goes into a trance and talks to her like her husband would. Then, it was as if her husband just jumped into this man's body to keep talking to her: in the buff on a massage table. And, when the encounter was over, she walked the masseuse upstairs to ""find out where the strange music was coming from.""  Why wasn't he concerned about blacking out or that someone else was talking through him? I am sorry, but this book sounds insane or made up. Honestly.I know about the afterlife, and how very much energy is needed for them to come through, if that. He is there in person as much as the Rat Pack was in Vegas in the 50's. There is something so sad and pathetic to think people who are of sound mind would believe her OR finish this book. If she came up with grieving therapy, I don't want to know about hers. I could not force myself to be curious enough to read something I would have no business needing to know about.

"I was so excited to try this brand. I think that little green star with ""50 pcs"" drew me in. Great marketing!!!! My cat absolutely loves the Chenille Kraft 1 inch glitter balls to play with. Before you say they are harmful to cats: I bought individual ones at a pet store, compared them to the Chenille, AND THEY WERE IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY.  These are absolutely gorgeous, and they make you want to stare at them all day. The colors are in the fabric, also. They feel more durable (hard) than the others. However, the very same with the SIX  2 inch Creativity Street Glitter Poms (they advertise 16). I opened both bags right in front of my cat, and she just walked away. There must be some chemical smell they can smell that repulsed them. Has anyone else bought these for their cat? Is there any way to wash the smell out? She goes bonkers with the other poms, and can't wait for me to open them, then she takes and thinks she is hiding them from me. She won't go near these. They would beautify any craft real well. I am thinking of buying Styrofoam balls and glue these on for festive decorations. I will buy more for projects like these. I love the bright colors.

I bought these for my cat, who loves me to ""flick"" the balls, and she brings it back. She took one look at them and walked away. I have them in the box they came in. I thought she'd like a larger size. They are absolutely gorgeous in color...and not just on the tinsel like most others. You will love them for crafting.

"I heard James Patterson was a brilliant writer. I saw the sandy beach, then thought ""Honemoon = exotic location"". Boy, was I wrong. I really don't know why he even named it that. Why not FEM FATAL or  THE POTION.....or better yet REWRITE THE BOOK, AND MAKE SOME SENSE OUT OF THE WHOLE THING. Start with a basic outline and stick with an original them throughout.I really like the first 1/3 of the book. That Nora was a clever, naughty girl. But then the P__N_S did the writing. Not erotica; just this one guy's description of her, and the other way around. It was overkill how gorgeous they all were.The book began to make one think even the writers were getting sick of writing the book. There was nothing about a honeymoon nor a beach. I doubt the author's even thought out the plot line to follow.  This man  (character in the book) who was supposed to be on a non-police stake out ends up going gaga for her, also. And she just happens to want HIM in bed?Then comes the decline. One could slide down that hill. The rest of the story seemed to me like the last third of the book was just thrown together to get it over with.For being a James Patterson book (this was my first read), it sure doesn't represent his brand very well. But, I did like his commercial for ""Private Vegas"" and bought the audio book. Last time I checked, Beverly Hills was NOT IN VEGAS!

"Pardon me. I wrote a lot on my Kindle and it froze up and I lost everything.  This book is sort of a call to arms to get people thinking and openly talking about sexual abuse, molestation, and incest.  Mr and Mrs Miller, in 1978, decided that they wanted to join other international ministries through their denomination. They chose to go to Novatia, Africa after hearing great things about that country. One of those things was ""the dedication of the scores of missionaries who had worked there for a quarter of a century"" (p. 27). All the missionaries around that area felt as if they were all brothers and sisters in the church.One day, Dee went to see a missionary co-worker's visuals or her presentation. The husband was the only one home.She knew and trusted the couple for many years. Yet, intuition told her she should not be there. He then tried to sexualy assault her. She ran around the kitchen table and then seen a monster who molested others before; and that he may kill her to keep quiet. She finally made up her mind to find other victims so they could band together and have him removed from Africa.  But, she knew that more needed to be done to get him the help he needs before he could molest one more woman or girl.She wrote her story to alert us to the epidemic of pediphiles, rapists, incest and sexual predators. She tried nearly everything to get the local committee to listen to her. Friends she trusted no longer wanted to talk to her. The men were.blaming her for trying to cause trouble. She wrote letters to the home office, to the local leaders, and her husband even got involved in the whole mess. Men have their ""good ole boys club"" and they stick together. The wives dutifully keep their mouths shut, even when they know what happened and is continuing to happen in secret.The purpose of her book was to tell victims that they are not alone; and they must speak up. Also a denomination is not alone when it comes to sexual victims and their perpetrators AND those problems MUST not be ignored or hidden. (Forward  p. vi). Girls and women are afraid to tell anyone. First there is guilt, self-blame, denial, and fear of what others are going to think of them. Boys keep it all bottled up inside and keep telling themselves things such as ""I am a rotten kid"" constantly. Some of them grow up to do the same thing as their molesters.It chronicles the lives and struggles the Millers have to face in attempting to bring up the ""unmentionable""  to try to get more victims to tell what happened to them so that the denomination's home office will punish or relieve the man. Little did they know what they were in for. Dee also wants all of us to take a stand and fight this ""epidemic"" of sexual violence against women and children. You don't have to protest and get on tv. All it takes is in this book.  Why I like it is because something happened to me, also. No one wanted to believe me; and most said it was my fault. This silence cannot continue to go on... take baby steps until you are strong enough to do more. But, read this book so that you know you are not alone.****I was given a copy of this book to read and give my honest review from GoodReads Giveaways, Dee Ann Miller, and Prescott Press.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RZHEWBF2WHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0933451180#wasThisHelpful","R12RZHEWBF2WHW","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a novice reviewer when it comes to book reviews. I am always looking for advice on what to put in, etc.When I saw the title of this book, and the description mentioned reviews, I wanted to read this for advice. Mr. Foster also touched on what is and is not allowed in a review. And, he helped me better understand what readers want out of a good and helpful review.I am really glad that he told authors how to deal with negative reviews. It is MY personal belief that if there is a number rating system,that a reviewer can rate the book honestly; and it is their right to explain why it was not for them and why they rated it 1, 2 or 3 without fear of retaliation.I had a very bad experience with a disgruntled author just lately. I gave a 1. Then I wrote that the ""foods you love"" cookbook was mostly seafood recipes which was not for me but, people who do will love it. This author wrote a nasty comment that his/her book deserved a high rating because I said that it is a good cookbook for seafood lovers. Two ""others"" wrote nearly identical reviews within minutes of the author's. I was supposed to be intimidated. That author acted like a schoolyard bully instead of a working professional. Shouldn't they be held up to the same standards as others?I look to read books that I would like. I don't give out 1-3 very often, because I have good intuition about great reads. The book above had a title that was not represented in the pages. That was not my fault. There was no mention of seafood in the description, either. I was relieved to read advice to authors who get their feelings hurt if someone gives constructive criticism. That should be on Amazon's list of no no's also. Authors and their friends should be prohibited from bullying because a reviewer, any reviewer rates 1-5, indicative of their own like or not, with honest, polite, constructive advice.As a book lover and trying to help others like me (I read reviews before I buy, also), I try to review the book as soon as I can while everything is still fresh in my mind. I do review ALL BOOKS that anyone gives me to read and review. I may have several ahead of that one.Please take Mr but please don't send emails every other day ""reminding"" me, please. Like Mr. Foster explained, not everyone will be willing to give a positive review, if any at all. I absolutely gained a lot of information as a reviewer. I recommend this to any writer or reviewer who want to improve their writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AVIFUJUMWEDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9GS966#wasThisHelpful","R1AVIFUJUMWEDE","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this book by intuition; and am I ever glad I did. I had a deja vu experience 1/4 into the book, I could have sworn I have read it before a very long time ago. However, the story is broken up into different times in the life of Jack McGuire and people close to him. These are not ""flashbacks"", and they don't confuse the reader. They add to the book (like pieces of a puzzle)..... so he is a child with a brother on a farm in Nebraska and they both get the flying bug from a neighbor. Jack goes to flight school and meets his best war buddy, Don. After the war, Jack is still on the island where he was stationed. A lovely lady comes for a few days, and Jack can't get her out of his mind...... but the chapters are broken up into different times of his life: to make the story so much more interesting that a straight, linear storyline. The book continues to get better and better to the very end. Heikki Hietala (from Finland), with the help of others, researched what it was like for REAL WWII veterans who shared their recollections. It took 12 years for him to write his first novel. He hit this one completely out of the park! I took forever reading it. Then I knew why....I loved the plot, the characters, the intrigue, and wanted to know what was going to happen next. I wanted to experience every little nuance, the ambiance of the island in the South Pacific, where the pilots had to constantly have dogfights with the Japanese planes in the air. Who wouldn't come back to base. It is so ""human"", if I may use that word. It is not a stale book. He has given tons of thought to put into his words. They flow so well. It transports you directly into Jack's world as it really would have happened. There is no macho, over the top characters or unbelievable action adventure. It doesn't need it. Real life is enough. The main theme of the story is that the only real thing you get out of life is memories, so make as many of them as you can. Nothing else matters as much as those. *NetGalley and Fingerpress Publishers gave me a copy of this book to read and give my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IIYT65W6A4CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ISHPDK#wasThisHelpful","R3IIYT65W6A4CI","A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BG7Q6NNZCEGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cat Stevens' Izitso was first released in April 1977 on A & M Records here in the States. It was his first album after Numbers which wasn't the big seller that his previous albums on A & M had been. Cat teamed up to work on Izitso with co-producer David Kershenbaum. The album being recorded in several different locations, a wide variety of backing musicians such as Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and even jazz legend Chick Corea pops up on here. The album brings in synthesizers which are generally used to create a lush contemporary sound although he does experiment with them as well here and there. It's the strongest overall batch of songs that Cat's turned in on a single album since Teaser and the Firecat in my opinion. The remastering on the 2000 version is great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O5H26HMYWZV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002GG9#wasThisHelpful","R3O5H26HMYWZV2","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In early 1994, King Crimson reformed the 1980's lineup while adding Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto who'd worked with Robert Fripp and David Sylvian. They began working on material at Applehead Studios in Woodstock, New York which led to the VROOOM ep which in turn led to The VROOOM sessions cd in the Collector's Club. It's now compiled here as Maximum VROOOM. The new lineup would begin touring Argentina at the end of September before going into Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Bath in late October.  B'Boom Live in Argentina would document some of those shows and is included as Hi-Res stereo on the dvd and blu ray while outtakes from Real World show up as JurassiKc THRAK and EPK THRAK.  THRAK was first released in April 1995 (actually it's the 2002 remaster featured along with the 2015 re-imagining) with the Double Trio lineup beginning it's tour on May 1st spending most of the next two years touring the UK, US and several shows in Mexico.The THRAK box contains three ""best of"" sets of the band's multi night runs in London (Kcensington THRAK), New York (New YorKc THRAK which is pretty much the On Broadway Collector's Club release) from 1995 and Mexico (AzteKc THRAK) in 1996 mixed from the multi track tapes. The box also features a previously unreleased video of a show at the Warfield in San Francisco although the first couple of numbers are missing. The Deja VROOOM video is also here remastered along with a new feature called Tony's Road Movies. ATTAKcATHRAK is a new and improved version of THRAKaTTaK. Bite Size THRAK includes the single edits along with 4 songs from the Nashville Sessions in 1997 which marked the end of the Double Trio lineup. The box is loaded with the usual ton of extras (big book, posters and so on). There are also High Res rips of all the stuff spread out over the dvds and blu rays. The only drawback for me here is that this is the first KC box to not include a full performance on disc. I probably would've included all of the Mexico shows on cd here as there still not currently available in their entirety on DGM Live.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDLVL4NWSWP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013L37JRE#wasThisHelpful","R2BDLVL4NWSWP6","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes' fourth album Fragile was first released in the UK in November 1971 and January 1972 in the US. If you're reading this then you already know that this is one of the best albums ever recorded. To me, previous cd editions all fell a little short of the original album's sound. The one that worked the best for me was the MoFi version but even that felt a little off. I think Steven Wilson has really nailed it here and the sound is fantastic. The Blu Ray audio also includes the new mix in stereo and surround sound, the original mix, a needle drop from the first pressing as well as the 2002 dvd-a mix.

"The new Elements box is a lot like the old one in that it's mostly made up of stuff that has appeared in the box sets, 40th Anniversary Editions and Mr. Stormy's Monday Selections. Whereas the first one sort of focused a bit more on the 1969 to 1974 era, this one focuses a bit more on the Adrian era as well as including a couple of things from the current lineup. The set opens up with the Wind Excerpt and an instrumental version of Epitaph. It's the one on the first album with the vocal track removed. Cat Food is actually a nice instrumental studio run through with the players working the song out. Bolero is the version from Frame By Frame that has Gordon Haskell's bass parts replaced by Tony Levin. From Islands, we get a studio orchestra run through of an instrumental Islands and A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls. Larks' II is on USA and The Road to Red while Fracture is from The Road to Red.Next up is the guitar extract from One More Red Nightmare which leads directly into the Live at the Orpheum version. The first disc is rounded out with the 12"" dance mix of Elephant Talk, an instrumental take of the unfinished song Absent Lovers from Beat and a nice instrumental that would become part of Sleepless and Larks' III from the Three of a Perfect Pair album. The second disc relies largely on THRAK, The ProjeKcts, The Power to Believe and the new lineup with a few other things mixed in. It's also nice to have a couple of more songs from 2004 and 2008 on cd. There's a nice flow to the set and it works well as a compilation. It's a nice addition to any Crimheads collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKHR64QMBVHNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CLR31E#wasThisHelpful","RKHR64QMBVHNB","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Grateful Dead are putting out an 80 disc box set, yeah 80 disc! No info on what Grateful Dead song it will be."" - Conan O'Brien 06-02-15For $700.00, there are some criticisms that I want to get out of the way up front. The sleeves that hold the cds aren't so good. They're thin and they look like they could end up scratching the discs. It's hard to get the cds out without leaving fingerprints. They are not digi packs with holders in them. They're the kind that you actually have to slide the cds out. I would've preferred them dropping the scroll in favor of better sleeves that actually hold the cds. Some of the disc splits aren't great as well. On the 1981 show, the disc split is between Sailor/Saint and the Caution jam that flows out of it instead of at the beginning of Drums or between Drums/Space. The '88 and '95 shows could've fit on two discs without any fades between Drums and Space.  Not all the shows are upgrades to what currently circulates. 10-27-79 actually sounds poor compared to the last remaster from a couple of years ago that circulates for free on certain torrent sites which is pitch/speed corrected.On the plus side, shows like 11-10-67, 09-24-72, 10-03-76 (although it's a bit edited because the drums is missing from the sbd so there's an additional edit to try and make it seemless), 10-12-84 and 10-26-89 have never sounded better than they do to me here. 11-10-67 and 10-26-89 are mixed from professionally recorded multi tracks. The box is great looking and the show selection is also very good too. Granted, you can always wonder why they picked x show over y show but that's always the case in the situation where you can only pick one show from each year. Am I happy to have it? Yes. Would I be willing to purchase another box costing this much or more? No. I feel that it's successful in some ways but I'm not entirely won over either. For $700.00, each show should be the definitive version of each show but unfortunately, that isn't always the case here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAX3NZS90J34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DJ5DKY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAX3NZS90J34","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cirkus was first released around the Summer of 1999 and is a compilation of Fripp's picks from the live material that had been released up to that point in time. The first disc focuses on the band's more recent era including a bit of the ProjeKcts while the second disc focuses on the earlier era. The songs are edited in such a way as to flow in and out of each other or begin as soon as the other one ends. The main problem is that, on the first disc, in particular, all the song choices are given to the band's heaviest songs while omitting songs like Matte Kudasai, Discipline and Exiles. It makes the release sound a little one dimensional and even a bit fatiguing in spots.

Given the fact that the band's back catalog was also getting ready to be re-released in remastered editions in 1994, this did feel like the label was sticking it to the fans. To be fair, this collection does seem more geared to the causal listener than the rabid fan. This was the release that you tended to see at places like Copperfield's, Barnes & Noble or other non record stores in the mall in the pre-Starbucks era.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234ODCWWQ4QQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002IWE#wasThisHelpful","R234ODCWWQ4QQW","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Classic Yes was put together by Chris Squire (RIP Fishy) and first released in time for Christmas of 1981. It was a single album along with a 45 rpm single. The main album consists of songs from the albums: The Yes Album, Fragile, Close to the Edge and Going For the One. The single was two unreleased live performances of I've Seen All Good People and Roundabout which were holdovers from the previous year's Yesshows which was also released in time for Christmas. They also now appear on the expanded and remastered version of Yesshows. The total time for the disc with both the album and single make the disc run about an hour which isn't bad at all for the days of vinyl.As far as single disc compilations go, this is one of the best ones on the market as far as I'm concerned. It's not as career spanning as say the single disc Highlights: The Very Best Of Yes but it hangs together better. Remember that the earlier stuff had also already been covered on Yesterdays which is the other great single disc collection. This one is more focused on the band's Progressive era and even has some of Roger Dean's best artwork. This is also one of the only official Yes comps to include live versions of a couple of songs which I really like. At the time when this was first released, Yes was broken up so there was an air of finality about this album at least for me. I have the other cd releases of this but recently I was a buck or two short on free shipping so I ordered the newest release of it on Rhino Flashback and it's still the 1994 remaster that's being used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2YT271JK6TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00770KFEM#wasThisHelpful","R3I2YT271JK6TX","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yesstory was first released in 1992 and is a slimmed down ""greatest hits"" highlights release of the Yesyears box eliminating pretty much all of the rarities. This compilation runs from the band's first album all the up to and including Big Generator covering the band's Atlantic/Atco era in the order they were released. The majority of the material here is from the band's ""Classic Era"" from 1969 through 1978. Owner Of A Lonely Heart and Rhythm Of Love are the only songs representing the '80's as nothing from Drama is included.The set itself is put together very well for the most part and runs about 2 and a 1/2 hours. The release opens with the rare stereo version of Something's Coming as well as some of the band's longer songs Close To The Edge and Ritual as well as Roundabout, I've Seen All Good People, Starship Trooper, Heart Of The Sunrise, Time And A Word, Yours Is No Disgrace and Wonderous Stories. The only drawback, at least for me, is that no live songs make the cut. Still, this is a good overview of the band and certainly better than next year's Highlights: The Best Of Yes. Mine's the old factory pressed cd set so I have no idea about the cd-r version that Amazon is now selling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9AIZEMRYRS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002JPU#wasThisHelpful","R3D9AIZEMRYRS4","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty good performance from near the end of the band's Three Album Tour although Close To The Edge is omitted from this release. I'm not sure if it was actually played that night as there were a few shows on that tour that were slimmed down due to time constraints. The performances here are pretty good although they feel a little ""draggy"" in spots to me. This was the first tour to feature the song A Venture and it's played well here. Perhaps because they were nearing the end of a tour, the band sounds a little tired compared to some of the other performances I've heard from this tour. For me, it's actually songs like Turn of the Century that turn out the best here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TVVVFO1PDGKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD768C0#wasThisHelpful","R1TVVVFO1PDGKF","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I still remember when this was first released around Thanksgiving '91. I was in Tower Records, saw that King Crimson had a box set and ran to the check stand without even looking to see what was on it. The box was a pretty good collection at the time including things like the single version of Cat Food/Groon which had previously only been available on A Young Person's Guide which never made it to cd in the U.S.. There was some legal stuff that had gone on with Gordon Haskell so Cadence And Cascade has a new vocal track recorded by Adrian Belew (this is still currently the only place that you can find this version) and Bolero with Tony Levin on bass (now an extra on 40th Anniversary of Lizard). The King Crimson Barber Shop makes it's first appearance here and on top of this, we get a whole disc of previously unreleased live stuff.The drawback about this set, for me are the edits that are used instead of the whole songs. It isn't too bad on the first disc (the improv after Moonchild is edited out and the first couple of seconds of cymbals on Sailor's Tale) but the second disc suffers much more. About half of Fracture is edited out and about two third's of Starless. Starless ends after the vocal section and Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part I is abridged as well. All the discs here run under the maximum playing time even by 1991 standards. Had this been laid out a bit differently, we could've avoided a couple of the edits. I would've like to have seen the live stuff mixed into the discs into their proper eras in the set among the rest of the music. For example, the live stuff from the first Crim after the In the Court songs and so on. The booklet and family tree are nice but everything from here minus Adrian's Cadence are available elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIC2WZIGOGVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000HSG#wasThisHelpful","R2PIC2WZIGOGVF","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After The Present was released in late Summer of 1983, Decca was bought out by Polygram Records. The band began to shop around for a new producer and settled on Tony Visconti. The first album of new material on the new label would be The Other Side of Life released in April 1986 which is the first disc in this set. The album finds the band shedding it's more orchestral flavor for the more contemporary sound of drum machines and sequencers. This would also be the first album that founding member Ray Thomas wouldn't get a single song in 20+ years of recording. The album boasted the big hits Your Wildest Dreams and The Other Side of Life. Other standouts for me are Running Out of Love, Slings and Arrows and It May Be a Fire. This was the first digital recording that the band did and had never been remastered until now. The remastering is a major improvement. As an added bonus we get single edits as well as live versions that were b sides which have never made a cd appearance until now.The second disc in the set is a previously unreleased performance from July 8th, 1986 The Blossom Music Centre in Cleveland, Ohio on The Other Side of Life tour. The disc is fairly full and there are a couple of other songs from this show that are the live single b sides bonus songs on The Other Side of Life. If you add all the songs up from this show, you get about 85 minutes from the two hour concert. If you want to put them in performance order, it should be: Gemini Dream, The Voice, Rock 'N' Roll Over You, Tuesday Afternoon, Your Wildest Dreams, Isn't Life Strange, The Story In Your Eyes, It May Be A Fire, Veteran Cosmic Rocker, The Other Side Of Life, I'm Just A Singer, Nights In White Satin, Legend Of A Mind and Question. It was also one of the first tours where the band brought along additional musicians. I've had this box since it was first released a few months ago and this is a performance that I keep going back to.The remaster of Sur la Mer kicks off the third disc which features the hits I Know You're Out There Somewhere as well as No More Lies and Vintage Wine. It was first released in early Summer 1988. Unfortunately, for me, I find this album less successful overall than The Other Side of Life although some really seem to like this one so your mileage may vary. Ray doesn't appear on the album at all, and the imput from both Graeme and Patrick is less as well. The album feels even more awash in harsh digital sampling sounds. The bonus songs are the single edits of I Know You're Out There Somewhere, No More Lies, Al Fin Voy A Encontrarte (which is I Know You're Out There Somewhere in Spanish) as well as the re-recordings of Question and Isn't Life Strange that appeared on The Moody Blues Greatest Hits. This box also includes a blue colored vinyl single of Al Fin Voy A Encontrarte.The next disc features Keys of the Kingdom which was first released in June 1991. Patrick Moraz had become dissatisfied with his role in the band. He was unhappy that the band kept passing on his songs and he felt that the music was becoming too simplistic. The whole thing ended in a law suit. The band also went through a number of producers during the album's making. Drummer Graeme Edge only appears on three songs while the rest of the sessions are handled by session drummer Andy Duncan or a drum machine. On the plus side, Ray Thomas makes his first appearance since The Present eight years earlier. While the album isn't entirely successful either, it does have a number of good songs like: Say It With Love, Bless the Wings, Is This Heaven?, Lean on Me (Tonight), Hope and Prey and Celtic Sonet. The song Highway should've been included on the original release but is here as one of the bonus songs. There's also a US promo edit of Bless the Wings as well as a few songs recorded for BBC Radio One.The final two discs and the two dvds are given to the band's A Night at Red Rocks with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra release which was recorded September 9th, 1992 in Colorado. This was recorded during the era where the band was doing shows with symphony orchestras and people seem split on it. I happen to like it but for some others, it can be a bit much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PJLM6F0OYBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPJYC98#wasThisHelpful","R11PJLM6F0OYBQ","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this era, as do many other King Crimson fans but I do think this box could have been done slightly better. Shows like 4-9-73 Olympia in Paris, 6-16-73 Community Theatre in Berkeley and 6-23-73 Richards Club in Atlanta aren't included even though Doctor Diamond appears on the Audio Curios disc. All three of these shows are available as official downloads from DGMLive and I've had them for years. They also didn't bother to include the unedited version of The Night Watch from 10-23-73 The Apollo in Glasgow even though it's available on the download version of the concert. I already have the entire concert downloaded but it would've been nice to include both the edited and unedited version here on disc. The 3-30-74 Elzer Hof in Mainz show ends with a jam of Easy Money -> Fracture-> Larks' II but the soundboard cuts early into Fracture. In the past, they've always grafted the audience on to the soundboard to make it complete and it still would've fit all on one disc but unfortunately, they didn't do that this time. This means that if you want to hear the entire show, you have to switch between two different discs and deal with overlap. The audience portion is here but on the Audio Curios disc. All in all, a mostly perfect release but just a little short of a five star review. I've had this since it was released a few months ago and these flaws still bug me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RG2LLCJBC6MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOZ1N7S#wasThisHelpful","R1RG2LLCJBC6MU","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like others, I was hoping for a longer release, There were a lot of great songs that were played on the tour that didn't make this release like Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part I, Pictures of a City and even A Scarcity of Miracles. Still, what made the release is generally very good and the sound quality is a good as it gets but it does make me wish we had more. One More Red Nightmare made it's first ever live appearance during this tour and it's a real knockout. Other standouts are The Letters, Sailor's Tale and Starless. This is definitely a must have if you're a King Crimson fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2UK2N3P1PVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJH5O9K#wasThisHelpful","R3D2UK2N3P1PVC","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you've bought the newest remasters, Collector's Club releases, box sets and kept up with Mr. Stormy's Monday Selections then there really isn't much here that you don't already have.

"I actually ended up really liking this book. There's been so much written on the Grateful Dead in the last 20 or so years that I've pretty much stopped keeping up. We've had books written from the merchandising perspective and we've even had books written by Dead Heads on what it feels like to be a Dead Head. That's not to say that there hasn't been some excellent books written on the band but there's also been a lot that feel written just to ""cash in"" on the band's popularity. Bill's book is actually quite interesting and provides a fresh perspective on his life and times with the band. Bill was always more of the quiet one and never really seemed to do as many interviews as the rest of the guys so it's really cool to read his perspective on things.

"In February 1974, The Grateful Dead played three shows at Winterland on the weekend of Friday 22nd to Sunday the 24th. The band was working on songs that would end up on their next studio album From The Mars Hotel which would be released on June 27th. Several of these songs as well as It Must Have Been the Roses make their first appearances during this run. The Saturday show would mark the last appearance Here Comes Sunshine until December 1992. These shows would also a more practical purpose: to raise money to help Keith and Donna buy their own home. Donna had their first kid in December and the money from this run helped them buy a house.The first set opens with U.S. Blues, a song that had first been introduced the previous year in a different arrangement as Wave That Flag before dropping out of the set lists in April. U.S. Blues debuted on Friday night. The rest of the first set is given to extremely well played standards at the time before giving way to a massive set ending Playing In The Band. The second set opens with a ripping Cumberland Blues, a jammed out Weather Report into a cool Row Jimmy with great versions of new songs It Must Have Been the Roses and Ship Of Fools.

"The problem with this collection is that it tries to shove too much into 2 cds as a retrospective. Yes generally recorded long songs and with 19 studio albums, there's just no way to do it decently. The band also has several great live albums but none of it is used here. So, what we get here are a few songs that are edits. It would have been nice if they'd just used other songs if they couldn't have fit the whole songs on here or as the 3rd disc is rehearsals of acoustic Yes stuff and it's fairly short. It would have been better to stick this stuff at the end of the 3rd disc and stretch out the stuff on the first couple of discs which wouldn't have ended in edited versions. They would've also been able to stick a couple more songs on the set and make it more filling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OE7ECAU9VH5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00016XNZM#wasThisHelpful","R3OE7ECAU9VH5F","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a budget priced release made up of Moody Bluegrass (2004) and Two Much Love (2011) on Bunny Rae Records and distributed by Red River Entertainment. I think that both of the original releases might still be available individually as I saw them not that long ago still being sold somewhere. The packaging for this two cd version is really cheap. The songs are generally well done and the second disc Two Much Love has Justin, John, Graeme and Mike guesting on different songs. There are a few spots where it turns into sort of generic bluegrass. A few big names turn up here including Peter Rowan.

This release comes from a cassette of an FM broadcast probably a generation or two removed from the master. Each disc is around the 45 minute mark. Still, the sound quality is quite good considering that. The set list is also typical for the era.

"I received this as a birthday present back in July '13. I'd already spent a bunch on the pre-order for the big box version of Timeless Flight so a friend picked this up for me. The album starts off with the song In Your Blue Eyes and you just know it's going to be good when it starts off like this. The album has a more down to earth feel than View From the Hill and, I think, it benefits as a result. Part of that more than likely comes from that part of the album was recorded around the sessions that Justin did for the Moody Bluegrass Two Much Love in 2011. That has since re-released with both volumes as a 2 cd set with different artwork. If fact, the remake of It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart here first appeared there.

This was recorded on the tour for Justin's Spirits of the Western Sky tour last year and features Justin with Mike Dawes on second guitar, keyboardist/vocalists Alan Hewitt and Julie Ragins. Both Alan and Julie are currently with The Moodies as well. The sound is a bit stripped down and works quite well as a result. There are quite a few standouts such as the medley of It's Up To You/Lovely To See You, The Land Of Make Believe, The Western Sky, New Horizons, One Day Someday and It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart.

"This release is from a show recorded on Friday December 12, 1969 at a place that was briefly called the Thelma which little is known about. It was located on the Sunset Strip near the Whiskey. I knew someone up until about 8 months ago who caught the band quite a few times between 1966 and 1972 in the area and he couldn't remember the place (hey Gary H. if you read this). This was the third show in a three night stand with Steve Stills showing up at the first show on the 10th. Various parts of these shows have shown up in trading circles for decades. Even odder is that while some of the songs on the audience versions match the soundboard versions, others do not.As for this show itself, the first 45 minutes were missing from the vault for many years although a passable version turned up in trader's circles a few years back. The show opens with a grooving Cold, Rain and Snow and a rocking Me And My Uncle. Both Easy Wind and Next Time You See Me are taken at a slow pace with Pig and Jerry singing harmony on Next Time. There are great early versions of newer songs like Black Peter, Dire Wolf, High Time, Casey Jones and the newish combo of China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider mixed in with older songs like He Was A Friend Of Mine.

"Built To Last was first released on Halloween of 1989. To be honest, looking back it was pretty clear that there were going to be problems from the start. The wonderful Stanley Mouse cover art was rejected for this cover. The band also recorded most of the album in isolation from each other. The original recording sessions began at Marin Vets just as they had for their last album ""In The Dark"". Jerry and John Cutler were producing again. They quickly decided that the same approach wouldn't work and the recording sessions began getting moved around to various studios. The album was finally finished just a couple of hours before it was to be turned in. Unlike some, I like most of the songs but the problem for me here, as with Shakedown Street and Go To Heaven, is not the songs themselves but in the actual production. Jerry referred to it as ""confined space"" but to me it sounds more like ""confined void"". Despite this being a high end recording, the overall mix is actually very hollow and synthetic sounding.The opening Foolish Heart is actually a very good song but it fades out before the beautiful closing jam which was usually great in concert. Just A Little Light is actually one of, if not, my favorite Brent songs. Unfortunately, here it doesn't have the cool synth introduction or the nice extra little jam near the end that the live versions have. Built To Last is another great song but here it's played so slow that it's plodding. Blow Away was a really good song until they decided to rearrange it in an over the top manner in typical late '80's style. Victim Or The Crime is actually one of the two songs that benefits from the albums production style. Musically, the song always had a Twilight Zone feel to it and that actually pays off here. I guess that there are some Dead Heads who didn't/don't like this song but I do. We Can Run is okay but once again, the keyboard isn't used starting instead with a very brief Jerry intro. The lyrics also sound a bit heavy handed as if they're trying to shove them into the song. Standing On The Moon is a Jerry ballad and it comes across very well here and is the only song to use an acoustic instrument (aside from drums) in the mix. Jerry's acoustic guitar give the album a very earthy feel missing elsewhere in the album. Bob's Picasso Moon is a nice rocking song and it's given a decent treatment here. I'm not a fan of I Will Take You Home and it's actually my least favorite Dead song. Some people find it sweet but it's just too much for me. Your mileage will vary. All in all, the album sounds very much like it was recorded in 1989 for 1989. It manages to capture a lot of what I didn't like about the late '80's production style.This expanded cd version includes three extra live songs: Blow Away (which is from the show that would later be released as Crimson White & Indigo), an okay Foolish Heart (which was recorded during the run that would later be released as Downhill From Here although Foolish Heart isn't on Downhill), and the song California Earthquake which was played twice on the Fall tour after the San Francisco Earthquake of 1989.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XS0ZBBFAM8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EOTFFI#wasThisHelpful","R22XS0ZBBFAM8O","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Friday, November 17th 1972 found the Dead playing what would be their only show in Wichita, Kansas at the Century II Convention Hall. This show has circulated for years in less than stellar sound quality but here we FINALLY get it in all of it's remastered and uncut glory. The sound quality is even better than I thought it would be and the performance is a real barn burner.Everything in the first set has that extra little kick to it and pretty much everything is a standout performance. I would be remiss if I didn't at least mention Sugaree, Me And My Uncle, Tennessee Jed, Black-Throated Wind, Bird Song, Jack Straw, Box Of Rain, Don't Ease Me In and China Cat->Rider.  The second set features great versions of Cumberland Blues, He's Gone and a massive jam of Truckin'->The Other One->Brokedown Palace. To top it all off, there's even a nice bit of filler on here from November 15th at the Oklahoma Music Hall that includes a 30 minute Playing In The Band and Wharf Rat, among others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9NOUD5QEEKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY5GOZU#wasThisHelpful","R1I9NOUD5QEEKY","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Veterans Hall in Sebastopol is a small, lovely place to see a show. It's next to Forestville and the Russian River. The place is beautiful and surrounded by trees and hills. Did anyone else attend the Dead Dances there in the '90's? Kathleen, are you out there? On Wednesday, March 22, 1978 both Robert Hunter's band Comfort and the Jerry Garcia Band played a show there. The band at the time consisted of Jerry, John Kahn, Keith & Donna Godchaux, Maria Muldaur and Buzz Buchanan. There's also a guest appearance by future member Ozzie Ahlers (who was playing in Comfort at the time) who would replace Keith & Donna in the JGB. The band came rolling back into the Bay Area after a tour supporting the new Cats Under The Stars album.The first set features a well played set of standards for the JGB at the time with the standouts, for me, being Catfish John, A Simple Twist of Fate and The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down. The second set is even better featuring a great Mission In The Rain as well as the then new original Cats songs' Cats Under The Stars, Gomorrah and Love In The Afternoon. Mystery Train and Midnight Moonlight are excellent as well although the tape does run out before the end of Midnight Moonlight. Another great release and one of the better ones in the series although maybe next time, we can get a Reuben And Cherise and Rhapsody In Red.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNH1ARXWSAZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPHL7K0#wasThisHelpful","R2GNH1ARXWSAZ6","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most of the other reviewers here, I'm a massive Yes fan having bought all the albums in several different formats ranging from Vinyl to remastered Imports. I've spent massive amounts on solo albums and side projects as well as box sets and compilation releases. I grew up with albums like The Yes Album and Fragile.  I can usually find stuff that I really like on even the less successful albums like Union and Open Your Eyes. I even LOVED their last album Fly From Here so I know that they still have it in them. However, Heaven & Earth is the first Yes album where nothing really stands out and everything is just pretty much forgettable. I've given it multiple listens and everything just sounds flat and uninspired to me. The band sounds incredibly sluggish throughout the album.It's hard for me to ""Believe Again"" when it sounds like the band have lost the belief themselves. I read an interview with Steve Howe a few months ago and the impression I get is that this album was put together very quickly. Perhaps more time should have been spent on writing and recording this album. The album is produced by Roy Thomas Baker who was a really famous producer in the '70's for mostly producing ""bubble gum"" pop/rock. To me, the album sounds like a bland Yes cover band with actual members of Yes on it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILIW6ZC6TFQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQHON74#wasThisHelpful","R2ILIW6ZC6TFQ6","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve Howe's third solo album, Turbulence, was recorded in 1989 and released in 1991 on Relativity Records. It an album of instrumentals generally recorded with a trio of musicians featuring Bill Bruford playing on most of the album. The album is about 38 minutes and all the songs are very good. Songs like Corkscrew have even turned up in Steve's solo spots in Yes shows. The album is more upbeat that some of Steve's later solo albums and the songs generally move with a fast pace. The album tends to bypass Steve's more country and bluegrass stuff in favor of mostly all rocking songs. The album doesn't quite have the range of some of his other albums as a result. If you like Steve's more rocking stuff, you'll like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPU79OWEI0ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003BVU#wasThisHelpful","RAPU79OWEI0ER","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jon's second solo album, Song Of Seven, was first released on Atlantic Records in November 1980. I picked up my first copy around Christmas time in a Woolworth's. I still remember sitting at the soda fountain and drinking an old fashioned coke while I checked out the back cover. This was Jon's first solo album after leaving Yes the year before. In fact, several of the songs were written as possible Yes songs. I actually think that the majority of the album is actually quite strong although some of my Yes friends at the time didn't seem to care too much for it. Looking at some of the other reviews here I can see that there are some who feel the same. Still, I like it and the Wounded Bird cd that I've had for a few years sounds real good to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36YXB25987INH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CSUMCQ#wasThisHelpful","R36YXB25987INH","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve Howe's Quantum Guitar was first released in April 1998 on Resurgence and clocks in at about 60 minutes. I first picked this up a while back and this has become one of my ""go to"" Steve Howe albums. The album begins with a cool cover of Walk Don't Run and pretty much features one stand out song after another. There's also a great cover of Sleep Walk on here. The album is pretty much one great song after another. This used to be fairly common but it looks like it might becoming a bit rarer so you may want to pick this up for a good price while you can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SSFE0Y13WVW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000677W#wasThisHelpful","R2SSFE0Y13WVW9","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the end of 1980, Yes was disbanded with Chris Squire putting together the retrospective albums Yesshows and Classic Yes early the next year. Both Chris and Alan White began working on projects together and even released the single Run with the Fox in December 1981 while Steve Howe went on to join Asia. South African guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist solo artist Trevor Rabin, who had released several solo albums, was looking to join a band. At one point, he even auditioned for Asia and it was during this time that he met Chris and Alan. The three of them began a group that was to be called Cinema after the title of a side long song that they had worked up for the project in 1982. Former Yes member Trevor Horn was brought in to produce. During the recording sessions, they decided that they needed a full time keyboardist for the band. It was during this point that both Chris and Trevor discovered that they had another mutual friend in original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye. As the recording sessions were nearing completion, former Yes singer Jon Anderson, was brought in to help with the singing duties and Yes ended up being reborn. The song Cinema would end up in a very edited form on the record while the album ended up being named after it's original catalog number 90125.90125 was first released in November 1983 and marked a massive departure from the band's more progressive sound into a early 1980's pop sound which put off some older fans. To be honest, management's idea of having the band sporting Member's Only jackets and hiring Cyndi Lauper's hairdresser for Chris didn't help didn't help older fans impressions. I've seen interviews with the band members' later claim that they felt embarrassed by it. Even the artwork was of it's time and a shift away from the Roger Dean era artwork. The album would become a massive hit for the band and bring in scores of new fans. Songs Owner of a Lonely Heart, Hold On, Leave It and It Can Happen were all over the radio and MTV at the time. While I generally prefer the band's more progressive stuff, there's no denying that this is a very good early 1980's pop record. In fact, it's one of the best mainstream records of the early 1980's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OR75G0RERNX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009Z570#wasThisHelpful","R3OR75G0RERNX3","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marathon was first released in September 1979 and is produced by Keith Olsen, David De Vore and Santana. The album features new members Alex Ligertwood taking Greg Walker's spot on vocals while Alan Pasqua takes over for Chris Rhyne on keyboards. The album takes on a late '70's pop feel with a bit of Earth Wind & Fire. As a result, the album is a bit hit and miss but does include the good songs such as Marathon, the classic Aqua Marine, You Know That I Love You, All I Ever Wanted and Stay (Beside Me).

"Festival was first released in January 1977 and is produced by David Rubinson who had produced the band's last album, Amigos.

Gaylord Birch takes over on the drums from Leon ""Ndugu"" Chancler. There are also quite a few other standouts like Revelations and The River.

"Santana's Shango was first released in early August 1982 with Bill Szymczyk as it's main producer. The album also marks a brief return of Gregg Rolie who had left Journey not too long before. Good songs, for me, are The Nile, Nueva York, Oxun, Let Me Inside, Warrior and Shango. The main problem with Shango is that the good songs don't really standout. Even Santana's weaker albums usually manage to pack a couple of classics on them. Shango seems to be the exception to the rule although The Nile is very close.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVA6DPG708TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C6QD3Q#wasThisHelpful","R2VVA6DPG708TC","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inner Secrets was recorded in the Summer of 1978 and released that Fall. Tom Coster wasn't in the band although he does co produce this with Carlos. New members include: Chris Solberg, Chris Rhyne who took over keyboards from Tom and Armando Peraza. Santana had been heading back to a more mainstream sound since the end of his Jazz era which ended with Borboletta. At the time that Inner Secrets was released, AOR Rock, Funk and Disco were what was in fashion. The band downplays it's Latin and African roots for a more mainstream radio friendly sound. That's not to say that this album doesn't have it's moments. In fact, I like about half the album. Not their strongest album but it does have some good stuff. By the way, the Japan import has the original version of One Chain while the domestic copies have the ""Dance Mix"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3CD0BTCOU5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00409HBY0#wasThisHelpful","R2M3CD0BTCOU5J","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The late 1980's were an odd time for Santana. They weren't selling real well and the newer, more modern sounding pop albums weren't selling well with older fans. Both Blues for Salvador and Viva Santana did well by comparison and there was even a reunion tour featuring the early members that went over well as did the tour with Wayne Shorter. The band had been getting hard pressed by the label for quite a while to have a hit song. Spirits Dancing In The Flesh was released in June 1990 and is produced by Carlos Santana, Vernon Reid, Chester Thompson, Jim Gaines. The production style used here reminds me of Quincy Jones a bit. The band itself is back down to a six piece with new members Walfredo Reyes, Jr. and Benny Rietveld. The album features quite a few guests including a church choir on the title track. Like the last couple of albums by the band, this has some really good songs but it sounds a bit over produced for my taste. This is also the third Santana album in a row to feature a Curtis Mayfield cover. The album would be the last for Columbia Records.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XOC35FR2JOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000272I#wasThisHelpful","R37XOC35FR2JOK","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Carlos' third solo album was released in the Summer of 1980 features people like Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter joining Carlos. The album was released as a short two record set clocking in at about sixty minutes. As you might've guessed, the album has a very jazzy feel. While the band Santana was drifting towards a more pop sound, Carlos was using his solo albums during this time to explore in a more diverse direction. All the songs here are great and I love the jazz feel.

This was originally released around Christmas time with Grateful Dead - The Closing of Winterland Closing of Winterland: December 31 1978 which made it a rather expensive Christmas having to buy gifts for an ex AND myself, laughs. I had 5-19-77 on tape for decades and had 5-21-77 for almost as long. The first show was the second show of a two night stand at the Fox in Atlanta, GA and the other being from Lakeland Civic Center in Lakeland, FL which is the night before Dick's Picks, Vol. 3: Sportatorium, Pembroke Pines, FL, 5/22/77.5-19-77 (Thursday):The first set gets off the a rousing start with a ripping Promised Land before giving way to a killer Sugaree->El Paso. Peggy-O is a pretty number and it's played very sweetly here. Looks Like Rain finds Bob and Donna in good voice backed by some thoughtful playing from the band. Row Jimmy is a song I'm always happy to here and this one doesn't dissappoint. Passenger find Bob and Donna upping the energy with a rocker. Not to be outdone, Jerry returns the play with a soaring solo in Loser. The Dancin' In The Streets would melt the floor at Studio 54.The second set opens with a rip the roof off Samson And Delilah. Ramble On Rose sounds like a Gypsy caravan and Estimated Prophet is a dark monster. The jam of Terrapin Station->Playing In The Band->Uncle's John's Band->Drums->the Wheel->China Doll->Playing In The Band is quite inspired.5-21-77 (Saturday):The first set opens with a great Bertha and is followed by an equally good Me And My Uncle. They Love Each Other is sweet and Cassidy soars. Jack A Roe is done in it's early arrangement and it's one of the better ones to boot. Jack Straw is wonderful. Tennessee Jed is a blast while New Minglewood Blues is it's usual rocker self. Row Jimmy is a repeat from the last show and this version is just as good. Next up, another repeat with Passenger which is more powerful than a steam locomotive. The first set ends with an explosive Scarlet Begonias->Fire On The Mountain.The second set starts with another powerful Samson And Delilah and is followed by a standout Brown-Eyed Women. The second set jam of Estimated Prophet->He's Gone->Drums->The Other One->Comes A Time->Saint Stephen->Not Fade Away->saint Stephen->One More Saturday Night is wonderful and something every ""head"" should hear. the US Blues encore is missing due to time limits on the cd.

"This two cd set is a compilation of music played across four different nights at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. The band was still called the Santana Blues Band that year and featured: Carlos Santana, Gregg Rolie, David Brown, Marcus Malone and Bob Livingston. Marcus Malone was the guy who was discovered mostly homeless last December by KRON in the Bay Area last December. They contacted Carlos' people and Carlos showed up promising to help his old friend out. Both Bob and Marcus would be gone by the time the band began recording it's first album the following year replaced by Michael Shrieve, Michael Carabello and José ""Chepito"" Areas.The band still sounds a little embryonic at times and the jams would become more confident by the time that they played Woodstock in about eight months time. Still, what is here is very good for the most part and shows the band early on. Several of the songs here would turn up on the band's first album: Jingo, Persuasion, Treat and Soul Sacrifice.

"The Essential Santana was first released back in October 2002 before Sony owned Arista/BMG so nothing from Supernatural on was used. Santana was on Polydor/Universal in the early 1990's so none of that was used either. The original release was pretty well packed although disc two still had room for an extra song. In 2010, after Sony had acquired the rights to Arista/BMG and had access to Polydor/Universal, they put out Essential 3.0 in a digipack with an extra disc. While the extra disc does include some nice live stuff, it's also only around a half an hour and misses later stuff. It also doesn't include anything from Woodstock, Lotus or even Scared Fire.In 2011, Sony released yet another version of Essential Santana with a more recent picture of Santana on the cover and back to two cds. Unfortunately, this version drops a lot of the 1980's and 1990's stuff while over representing the Arista/BMG stuff. Really, two versions of The Game Of Love while other songs and albums are completely bypassed. Overall and for the amount you get, the original 2002 feels like the most thought out for what you get as the bonus disc on 3.0 is short and feels rather thrown together rather than carefully put together. Still, 3.0 can be found for about the price of the original release.

In 2010, after Sony had acquired the rights to Arista/BMG and had access to Polydor/Universal, they put out Essential 3.0 in a digipack with an extra disc. While the extra disc does include some nice live stuff, it's also only around a half an hour and misses later stuff. It also doesn't include anything from Woodstock, Lotus or even Scared Fire.In 2011, Sony released yet another version of Essential Santana with a more recent picture of Santana on the cover and back to two cds. Unfortunately, this version drops a lot of the 1980's and 1990's stuff while over representing the Arista/BMG stuff. Really, two versions of The Game Of Love while other songs and albums are completely bypassed. Overall and for the amount you get, the original 2002 feels like the most thought out for what you get as the bonus disc on 3.0 is short and feels rather thrown together rather than carefully put together. Still, 3.0 can be found for about the price of the original release. If you're going to pick one, go with 3.0 as long as you can get it for the price of the original.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NW80GNYQTQU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JJR16K#wasThisHelpful","R1NW80GNYQTQU4","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Multi-Dimensional Warrior is a pretty good Santana collection combining songs from Abraxas to Shaman with the emphasis on later post Gregg Rolie and Tom Coster era for the most part. The collection was picked by Carlos himself and five of the songs have been slightly modified with a new overdub or two. The 14 songs on disc one all have vocals while disc two are instrumentals with the idea being ""to create an engaging journey through a soundscape of moods and feelings."" Both the discs could've fit an extra song so it's a bit of a shame that nothing from an album like Caravanserai is included. Still, a very good collection that makes it a really nice listen especially disc two late at night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9ZQTRMNAALO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QEIORQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C9ZQTRMNAALO","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This release contains the lion's share of two shows. The first is from Wednesday May 10, 1978 at the New Haven Coliseum in Connecticut and the second from Thursday May 11, 1978 at the Springfield Civic Center Arena in Massachusetts. Many people seem to really like these two shows but I find them to just be okay. The sound quality suffers from a ""Boom Box"" feel and has a heavy thud. I have a hard time getting this to sound good on my stereo and it's hard to adjust the volume just right. Add to that, the mix isn't very good and really feels off. Bob's slide playing is way loud in the mix while Keith is nearly non existent. All in all, I've only played this a handful of times since it was first released in 2002.Some of the performances are very good such as Cassidy, Peggy-O, Let It Grow->Deal, Stella Blue and a few others but some of the jams I find a little flat. The Other One intro starts off nice but by the time they get around to actually playing to song, it's lost it's energy. Scarlet->Fire doesn't really have any jamming and is kept short unlike quite a few from this era that are nicely stretched out. Most of the jamming on these shows is confined to the Drums segments. The vocals are also off sometimes badly during these shows. I understand that the band was tripping heavily the second night anyway and these shows have achieved somewhat legendary status in Dead lore. Ironic, considering that this showcases what a lot of people consider to be some of the worst traits of '78 with Bob's slide, rough vocals, Donna screeching, sometimes sloppy transitions, little Keith and somewhat flat playing. If you like it, great but for me there are moments of greatness to be found but there's so much better from this era widely available elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGZ0LYMSTPPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANDCYHG#wasThisHelpful","R2XGZ0LYMSTPPN","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate Wolf & The Wildwood Flower produced their first album originally released on Owl Records in 1976. Kate was living in Sonoma County and was well known in the area being a DJ as well as performing in the area with her band The Wildwood Flower. The cover shot was taken at Goat Rock Beach in Jenner. Back Roads has a very intimate feel being recorded mostly live in a living room over 5 days in front of a roaring fire. The album is filled with great songs starting off with Kate's lovely Lately and also includes a great cover of The Redtail Hawk. When all is said and done, there isn't a weak song on the album. It's a shame that the album isn't better known because it's a masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAV55CZ0XAMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C39TKU#wasThisHelpful","R1GAV55CZ0XAMJ","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was first released in 1989 or so and was a ""nice price"" cd compilation on Pickwick Records. The band were still having hits on the radio and MTV at the time while cds were relatively new. This was even released on record. Moody Blues comps hadn't flooded the cd market yet. The nice thing about this release, which runs just under an hour, is that it tends to focus on more obscure songs. There's no Tuesday Afternoon or Nights In White Satin on here which made it a nice companion to Greatest Hits. However, adding Melancholy Man, Legend Of A Mind, Dear Diary and The Tide Rushes In would've made it even better. This Is The Moody Blues hadn't even been issued on cd yet although the version of Question here is that version. The songs are also somewhat evenly divided among the band members here: Justin gets 5, Mike gets 4, John gets 3, while both Graeme and Ray get two apiece.The set list is:Voices In The SkyOut And InCandle Of LifeAfter You CameFor My LadyCitiesA Simple GameFly Me HighSteppin' In A Slide ZoneSo Deep Within YouI'll Be Level With YouLeave This Man AloneDr. Livingston, I PresumeGimmie A Little Somethin'Please Think About ItQuestion","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WS9V828NBFZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000092DWR#wasThisHelpful","R1WS9V828NBFZZ","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a Word: Yes (1969-) was first released in July 2002 (remastered in 2008) by Warner Bros./Rhino and includes stuff up to 2001's Magnification. Rhino was getting ready to release remastered and expanded versions of the band's studio catalog from 1969 to 1984. All of Yes' albums from 1969's Yes through 1987's Big Generator were released on Atlantic Records (later Atco) which is owned by Warner Brothers.This five disc set is a pretty good overview except for the fact that there are no live songs. I also think the unreleased songs should've been released as bonus songs elsewhere or released on their own cd. The ones here are noting more than unfinished ideas or complete throw aways for the most part. The sound quality isn't all that good as well on most of them. I'm also surprised that the Grammy nominated Masquerade isn't included as well as And You and I, Into the Lens and Walls which received a fair amount of radio play at the time. I think that this should have been expanded to 7 discs to include the above to the box.I also would have added songs like I See You, Yesterday and Today, Looking Around, Something's Coming (stereo version), No Opportunity Necessary, Everydays (live), Mood For a Day, Long Distance Runaround/The Fish (replace studio with live version), Siberian Khatru (replace studio with live version), Your Move/I've Seen All Good People (replace studio with live version), The Remembering, Ritual (live), Parallels (live), Madrigal, On the Silent Wings of Freedom, Hearts, I'm Running, Birthright, The Meeting (replacing Fists of Fire), Quartet, Saving My Heart, Without Hope You Cannot Start the Day, Take the Water to the Mountain, Where Will You Be, The Revealing Science of God (replace studio with live version), Awaken (live) Onward (live), Foot Prints, Sign Language, Children of the Light (Keystudio version), From the Balcony, It Will Be a Good Day (The River), Lightning Strikes, Magnification, Don't Go and Time Is Time. I would have also included something from Jon's Olias, Chris' Fish Out of Water, Beginnings and The Steve Howe album. This could have been a great place to find a good overview of Yes all in one place but falls somewhat short.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9819NCQR9QUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FBWVD2#wasThisHelpful","R9819NCQR9QUK","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Badfinger's third album was released in time for Christmas 1971 here in the States and many Badfinger fans (myself included) tend to find it one of their best, if not their best. The band started work on it shortly after the release of their second album, No Dice. The production dragged on going through a couple of different producers for about a year before Todd Rundgren was brought in to finish the album. During Todd's time, new songs were recorded as well as others having new parts re-recorded for the final album.Both Todd and the band did an amazing job with this album. The songs are keepers and the production is very tight. Both Baby Blue and Day After Day would become massive hits for the album and band. The album, like the other three Apple Badfinger albums became somewhat hard to find after Apple folded. The only real three drawbacks to all these 2010 remasters are the somewhat flimsy packaging and no sleeves for the discs. Add to that, some of the bonus content being only available as downloadable content when there was still enough room to fit it all on the discs. The Name of the Game indeed EMI!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SN41BI1M4SNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XSSR4W#wasThisHelpful","R3SN41BI1M4SNS","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, Easter 1987. Easter weekend I saw the Grateful Dead perform three nights at Irvine, The Simpsons premiered on Tracy Ullman and by the end of the week, this album was released. I had been a Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fan for years already and seen them live a few times. However, this may be my favorite album of theirs. There's more of a stripped down rock feel with this record without all the guest appearances that popped up on Southern Accents and is back to a more group record. All the songs on here are 100 perfect with absolutely no filler whatsoever.I remember back when this was released, Tom said something like that there was enough songs left over to have made this a 2 record set. I'd LOVE to hear those songs! I've noticed that some people refer to this as a ""forgotten"" album but I've never really understood that. The album was a big fairly big seller, the band made the rounds on a few tv shows and there was even a tv special of the band in Egypt supporting this album. Granted, Jammin' Me wasn't as widely played as Don't Come Around Here No More and the sales were higher for Full Moon Fever a couple of years later. Stiil, forgotten or not, a true masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVSXZRQY5ANN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002O3B#wasThisHelpful","RBVSXZRQY5ANN","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long After Dark was first released in November 1982 and was the first album to feature Howie Epstein. The overall feel of the album has basic power chord/New Wavy feel to it. Whereas, previous albums tend to mix rockers with songs like Insider, the feel on this one doesn't change that much. Admittedly, I didn't care for this album as much as the other ones when first released. That being said, it actually has quite a few great songs with my personal favorite standouts being: You Got Lucky, Deliver Me, Change Of Heart, Finding Out, We Stand A Chance and Straight into Darkness. The other songs aren't really bad either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1JKM5UV7F1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005ABKB#wasThisHelpful","RX1JKM5UV7F1M","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ass made it's American debut at the end of 1973 and would be the band's last for Apple Records. Badfinger's then manager Stan Polley was already causing problems for the band. Todd Rundgren who had produced Straight Up had originally been hired to produce Ass but had a falling out about a week into production. The band then tried to produce the album themselves but had little success. Finally, Chris Thomas was brought in to produce the record. The album features two songs each by Pete and Tom, one by Mike and a full five by Joey. This is the most that Joey would have on any original Badfinger album. Highlights are many with Apple Of My Eye and Timeless by Pete, Blind Owl and When I Say by Tom. Joey's best are Icicles, Constitution, Get Away and The Winner. The other two songs on the album are okay. This edition features some nice bonus songs but I'm a little disappointed. Only some of the bonus songs make it to the disc while the rest are bonus digital tracks that are only downloadable in lossy quality. There's enough room to have fit them all on the disc but this is what Apple has done with all four Badfinger albums.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5BR654FKA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JO88PS#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5BR654FKA8","A1KYHC3ZXAJICU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KYHC3ZXAJICU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Live Anthology: Ultimate Collector's Box was released in time for Christmas in 2009 and runs from 1978 through 2007. This deluxe version includes: 5 live discs, 1 blu ray including high definition versions of the 5 discs, 2 dvds: 1978 New Year's Eve concert from Santa Monica, California, 400 Days, a documentary shot during the recording and tour for the 1994 album Wildflowers, and a repressing of the very rare Official Live 'Leg short lp.It's a bummer that they didn't include Official Live 'Leg on the blu ray. The discs are very well picked and the performances are top notch but each one runs about 15 to 20 minutes short of full playing time. There are quite a few classic songs and rarities that were played during the 30 year era that don't show up on here (Change Of Heart, It'll All Work Out, I Fought The Law, Blue Moon Of Kentucky, King's Road, Yer So Bad and so on). I should also point out that that a few of the songs on here are also already available on other releases like Runnin' Down a Dream - 4 Disc Limited Edition Set - Cd & DVD Box Set - DVD.

She was starting to get bald spots on her rear flanks from chewing on herself.I wish I'd taken a before photo of her before I started her on this product. Within 1.5-2 days, the itching slowed down, after another day, it stopped. By the end of the week, her skin was visibly improving. She's now been on it for 2 months and her entire body skin is back to it's regular color. No bald spots, no scratching herself, nothing. It's been a miracle product for us.Also, because my dog is only 11 lbs and because the bag only lasts 3 months, I gave half of it to my mom. Her Chi/Jack Russell mix was having itchy/dry skin. Since using this product on him, he has stopped scratching.Also, we both use the recommended amount and neither of our dogs have had diarrhea or gas problems as a result.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Y1TPJPFTYTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TAOYK6#wasThisHelpful","R11Y1TPJPFTYTB","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bumping this down to 1 star review.We pulled this out of winter storage, after very light use last year.After second day of using it, it won't stay upright when the kids are on it. I think the base is somehow bent. Odd since my  heaviest kid is just 60 lbs.------------------------------------I wasn't sure how this would work for my kids, ages just turning 6 and almost 4. The description says ages 3 and up, but I saw a reviewer mention that her older kids love to play on it too.My daughter turned 6 just when we bought this see saw. At it's highest, her feet still touch the ground. This is the perfect size for my 3 year old.I wish now we'd spent more and got the one that's so obviously larger.As a side note, the tool that's included with the see saw is not enough. My husband used it to assemble the see saw but parts were still wobbly. It was so bad we contacted the seller asking if it was defective. Then my husband tried some other tools and they were able to get the parts tight and flush. Bonus points to Hearthsong - they replied very quickly via email and were willing to help us if the see saw was defective.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25M8XG2XSPKVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OLZLMM#wasThisHelpful","R25M8XG2XSPKVG","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this coffee maker for about 3 years now, and it's worked reliably. I haven't had a problem with weak coffee as some have suggested, but I think it's because I tend to use more coffee than you're supposed to.As far as features go, this has none. It turns on and off and that's about it. For a simple coffeemaker, it works.I have a few big problems with this coffeemaker, which is how I stumbled upon this page. I'm looking for a new one. My biggest complaints about this coffeemaker are the following:- When making large pots of coffee (such as using maximum capacity) the coffee grounds basket will not drain quickly enough because it is almost full of the necessary grounds needed to make such a big pot of coffee. I usually have to switch the maker off mid-brew to allow it to drain for a moment, otherwise the grounds will overflow into the basket.- This is my biggest complaint: MESSY! Any time I pour, it leaks and drips out the spout. If I pour water into the maker, I have a puddle next to it where the water didn't cleanly pour from the carafe into the coffeemaker. When I go to pour my coffee into my cup, same problem: a puddle of coffee. I'm not sure why it does this -- perhaps mine has some type of malformation of the spout, but after 3 years of wiping up water and coffee, I'm looking for a new machine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVO7TYGZ5BM8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MVJQPA#wasThisHelpful","RVO7TYGZ5BM8E","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Overall, she LOVES the singing Ariel doll, and that she can transform her from a mermaid to a princess -- without mommy's help no less (so I'm thrilled she can work it herself to transform Ariel from fishy to fabulous).The only real disappointment is that Ariel has no legs. From the pictures, I assumed she had plastic Barbie legs that were crammed into a mermaid tail. Remove the tail, pull down the pink skirt, and there's your Princess Ariel.Instead, Ariel has a plastic square base. When you pull the pink skirt, the mermaid tail is pulled up inside her base and the skirt lowers to cover what would be her leg area. My daughter was hoping to be able to dress her in Barbie clothes. That situation aside, my daughter adores this doll and has been singing along with her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJ1DNJOGCWNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKH9NXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PJ1DNJOGCWNT","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this item from Elegant Baby via Amazon just over 5 years ago.My daughter was swaddled in this from the day she came home from the hospital. It's a large size blanket and perfect for swaddling newborns. Once she outgrew swaddling in it, she slept with it and it has since become her lovey. This blanket held up thru nightly snuggling, drooling, biting (teething) and endless washing. After about 3.5 years the edges started to fray. My mom was able to salvage it and add new fabric around the edging, making it as good as new again.Overall I am very happy with this blanket. It's certainly stood the test of time and abuse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X57D7H3HP1AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P22JFM#wasThisHelpful","R2X57D7H3HP1AI","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this booster seat to take with us on a trip, as it would be easy to carry thru the airport and gate check once we were on the plane. It served it's purpose well, but it definitely wouldn't be one I'd use daily. It has very little padding for your child's rear end and I can't imagine it would be comfortable for any trip of a decent length.Additionally, the booster seat I ordered from Amazon had a manufacture date that was several years ago (seats have a limited number of years lifespan).

"I randomly found this CD in a bin at a neighborhood garage sale and couldn't resist it -- with its 25 cent price tag. Once I got home, I popped it into my CD player and my ears were treated to a fun mix of feel-good pop.Whoever said men rule the world never heard of the sisters Hanson. These 3 young women are poised to take over the world with their beautiful harmonies which will surely delight any listener.The oldest Hanson is in her mid-teens but has a nice alto voice reminiscent of a teenaged boy. Middle sister Taylor Hanson is on the verge of puberty, but you can tell she's going to be a looker someday and her soulful crooning leads most of the tracks on this album. The youngest Hanson, well, not so cute but her spunky personality overcomes all and shines thru on songs like Lucy and Man from Milwaukee.Truly, these teen girls will go far in the world of music in the coming years. I can't wait to hear their next album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVOZ2AU9Y6YJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001ES7#wasThisHelpful","RVOZ2AU9Y6YJA","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this from Best Buy for under $50. What a score!This printer was a snap to add to our network, and is intuitive and easy to use.I had a Dell AIO printer that cost $300 that was always getting paper jams and having problems. This printer has worked perfectly with mild use.I like that's it's really compact, too. It fits well into our cabinets in the computer room.Unlike some other printers, the ink for this one is well priced. Some brands really jack up the price of ink.EDITING THIS REVIEW AS OF 9/12/2012This printer stinks in every way possible. My review was based on a very short usage time. Now that we've had this printer a while the biggest issues are that it goes to sleep automatically after a while, which means, when you go to print over the network, it doesn't wake up and print. Pressing the power button does nothing. Also, turning it off and back on doesn't reconnect it to the network. Usually we have to completely unplug it for 30 seconds and then plug it back in to get it to connect. What's the point of being wireless if you have to stand over it and dink around with it?Second big problem is the ink. It self cleans all the time. I've printed about 4 pages in color and the yellow and magenta cartridges are now out of ink. The printer refuses to print in black and white because the color cartridges are empty. What a ripoff! ZERO STARS!","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK16JFT4FES4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1MDKI#wasThisHelpful","RK16JFT4FES4Z","A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased one of these 4 years ago, just before my first child was born.It's still in use in our SUV. I have a 1.5 year old also and did not put one of these under her car seat. Needless to say - it's a lot harder to get her car seat installed evenly, and I recently removed both kids' car seats and was surprised at how deep the indentation was on the side that didn't have one of these installed, so I went ahead and bought another.I love that these protect the seats, not just from dust and debris, but from deep indentations caused by car seats.

So I came to Amazon looking for some hip pants that said, ""Hey world, I came here to do Zumba and chew bubble gum, and I'm all outta gum"". So I got these pants.These pants practically shout from the rooftops, ""HEY WORLD - I'M HERE TO ZUMBA AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!""These are also great for lounging around the house, DSHS appointments, clubbing, and going to PTA meetings -- and don't forget casual Fridays at work.

"We bought this because we are pet sitters, and we often have multiple dogs barking in our home at once.  The sound gets their attention and distracts them enough to get them to listen to me to tell them to calm down.  It works better on some dogs than others.  We also have 2 neighbor dogs that are often left in the backyard while the owners go out for the evening.  The dogs bark incessantly while the owners are away.  We placed this on the fence, and it does calm them at first, however, over time they seem to become resistant to it, and begin barking away again.Because we use this outside, we have accidentally left it out in the rain, and it still works after the exposure.I can say it does work with some dogs, but may not be the be-all, end-all solution you are looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROGEHSYDE8UGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DS6BNKE#wasThisHelpful","ROGEHSYDE8UGE","AAMRL61XPUT8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMRL61XPUT8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We love Kong products, and normally they are incredibly durable.  I bought this squeaker toy for my dog thinking that it would hold up to his squeaking and playing.  He ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!  He wouldn't put it down from the time it arrived.  He would squeak it, toss it in the air and let it bounce around, and then chase after it.  I was so happy to see him loving it so much and thought about immediately ordering more.  It has now been 4 hours since it arrive, and he just came to me with the head torn off.  No more squeaker, and the toy is ripping apart pretty easily now.  Very disappointed that it didn't last longer.Also, I have a medium dog (about 20 lbs) and ordered the medium sized toy for him.

"I really like the coverage I get with the new Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up.  It's very smooth and even, and feels light on your skin while providing really great coverage.  The downfall is the poor packaging.  The glass bottle has a very small opening to get the product out--you can't dip in your finger or makeup brush.  The product is so thick that it doesn't easily pour out of the opening, and you spend some time trying to coax the foundation out of the bottle.  This product needs to be in a squeeze tube or jar with a larger opening to be really useful.

"Admittedly, I've only used this product once, so my opinion could change, but I'm thinking it will only get easier to use!I read other reviews on here that talked about this tool cutting the drying time in half-- I didn't find that to be the case.  Because you're creating curl at the same time, I erred on the side of smaller chunks at a time, which ended up taking just as long.  The benefit however, comes with the end result!My hair looks like I had a  blow-out at the salon.  It is smooth and full and smooth.  My hair naturally has this really tight curl in the back and a straight front, which makes it difficult to style.  This product smoothed out everything so that you can't even tell that it has a tendancy to curl in the back.  Previously I would have to blowdry, then sometimes flatten with a straight-iron the back portion, then curl with a fat curling iron to get everything uniform.  I was able to style with just this tool today.Additionally, it was a lot simpler to use this tool.  I didn't have to juggle the blowdryer and my round brush back and forth.  I simply rolled each chunk up on the barrel and hit it with the hot air.  At the end I stuck the barrel under the top chunks (so they just draped over the barrel,) hit is with hot, then hit it with cool, and the end result was a lot more volume on top.

"This is a must read for all diabetics, and in particular Type 1 diabetic's. There is information in this book that you will not find anywhere else. However, think of Dr. Bernstein's plan as a rough guide to finding your own way. Yes, perhaps you are among the few that can follow such an extremely low carb (not  even onions or tomatoes are allowed) diet, and  for whom small, small doses of insulin are effective. For myself and a lot of other advanced Type 2  diabetics, one or two units of insulin before a meal, even an extremely low carb meal, is not going to do anything in terms of dramatic lowering of BS levels (as it does for the doc). This book has been accused of being geared towards Type 1 diabetic's, which is a little bit true, but it still is a great guide, and only that--A GUIDE for most Type 2s. Perhaps you are one of the few that will be able to follow the doctor's rules, and keep your BS levels around the recommended 83 mg/dl (or an A1C of 4.6 or lower). I was not without injecting moderate--50 units a day--amounts of insulin. And I do eat  extremely low carb. Instead I have a BS LEVEL OF 95-150 (A1C of 5.4), and take no medications or insulins. Once a month I have 2 cups of popcorn, my only carb splurge. Again, this book can really teach you a lot and is an invaluable guide for the low amount it costs; but I think it's important to view it as a guide and not gospel, at least for many of us anyway... Dr. Bernstein also has an extensive video presence on YouTube that is well worth checking out .","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGB81T81ESR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QZ9PC4#wasThisHelpful","RAGB81T81ESR2","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this mayonnaise first and foremost because of the ingredient list; it is by far the most healthy mayo out there for the those of us trying to avoid highly processed seed oils.  No doubt about that, and I shopped everywhere from local gourmet health food stores  to Whole Foods-- nobody carries a mayonnaise made entirely of olive or avocado oil, with no added processed seed oils. No one!  Ordering this rather expensive Primal Kitchen mayonnaise (in tiny jars) by Internet mail  order is the only option for a mayo free of highly processed seed oils BUT I have to say that this is not the best tasting mayonnaise I've ever used, that's for sure.  You can taste the avocado oil, but there is also a more ""Jeez, this is different"" taste that is just a little offputting, a little too tangy, at first. The texture is good, and  the emulsion is perfect, and you do soon get used to the tang and hint of avocado; and in many ways that you will be using this, such as in salads or deviled eggs, you won't notice it all that much, but it is much less neutral and easy going in flavor than traditional mayonaisses. I guess it's really not that bad, but again, it is not the best tasting mayonnaise that this foodie has tested.  But for me, the optimal, ideal ingredient list wins out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K158PQUM2KSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWKI0HI#wasThisHelpful","R2K158PQUM2KSH","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is an amazing blender, and I just adore it. However for some people it could be a disappointment. For starters, it's really for a single person, or perhaps two people who are light eaters. But for two people with healthy appetites, this blender really is a bit too small, even for just smoothies--and you'd probably be much better off with a full-size Vitamix. Biggest problem I have with this model is the size of the small single serving cup.  It's cute and it's double insulated, but unless you're making a very small smoothie, it's just too small. And if you try to overfill it, this smaller Vitamix just can't handle it, particularity if any of the ingredients are frozen; and unlike the larger container that has a lid that that features an open feed hole, you can't use the tamper to force the ingredients into the blades. In fact even when using the larger 40 ounce container, you very often have to use the tamper-- for thick smoothies with frozen ingredients, for seed butters, for ice cream made with frozen bananas and soy milk ice cubes--you will have to use the tamper, and work (force) the  ingredients down into the vortex of the blender (plenty of videos on YouTube to see this Vitamix tampering action if  you are not familiar with it). The larger Vitamixs with stronger motors, can often handle things like thick frozen smoothies, and you don't have to use the tamper, but not so  with this lower powered, smaller model . Once you use the tamper to assist the blender to get a hold of everything, however, the blender works great and gets things perfectly smooth and wonderful. For me, this blender really has changed my life. My goal was to get more fresh vegetables and fruits down into my gut, and now I can do this with either smoothies, or juices (strain the smoothie through a nut milk bag), or I can make fresh creamy soups with all kinds of different vegetables, right in the blender ( my current favorite is cauliflower cheddar cheese ); I think it's great that after seven minutes, the S30 gets soups piping hot and satiny smooth . I bought my unit refurbished, and it was just like new and operated flawlessly. I recommend the refurbished units for those trying to save money on these expensive and wonderfully made  American  blenders. You really can see the quality of these Vitamixs as opposed to the Chinese made Nutribullet for instance.  After living with this blender for a month now, I would never give it up, and I can see why people have raved over these machines over the years.  If you are single, or part of a healthy fit skinny couple that doesn't eat too much, I can't recommend this unit enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8JVXPOB2MZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIW4ACG#wasThisHelpful","R3T8JVXPOB2MZR","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can't say that giving up wheat made for dramatic differences in my life, such as Dr. Davis talks about in his book. However,  as a diabetic it has greatly improved my blood sugar numbers, and cut much prescription insulin out of my life. And I really do think that I feel better and see less depression in my outlook on life. Is this all a dramatic difference? No, it really isn't dramatic (blood sugar aside) but I do feel better off of wheat and this book helped guide me towards this big change in my life. The recipes are great! They've really helped me a lot. Things like the flax seed wraps totally fulfill that need to have a wheat-like product (think of a cross between tortilla and pita bread )  for sandwiches, or I have even made quesadillas with the  flax seed wraps .  Many of the other recipes are great too and for me the price of the book was worth it alone just for the recipes and food ideas; mind you there are not a lot of recipes, but they are all very well done and thought out, and very effective for replicating the wheat and high carbo foods that we miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R537K09JID0DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00571F26Y#wasThisHelpful","R537K09JID0DM","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of erythritol,  and so I really wanted to like Swerve.  However, their proprietary taste isn't to my liking. This sweetener  tastes a little bit almost ""floral"", for lack of a better description.  It's fairly strong, and something I just could not get used to. The sweet, sweet real sugar-like taste of erythritol is gone, and instead Swerve's proprietary taste dominates.  On the plus side they did a very good job of making this product sweet enough to measure like real sugar, cup for cup. Erythritol is generally not  as sweet as sugar and it usually takes a bit more product to compensate (or it's commonly mixed with much stronger stevia); but this is not the case with Swerve which does measure just like sugar, cup for cup. But for me, I will take pure unadulterated erythritol, mix it with Trader Joes pure Stevia extract ( 2 teaspoons per 1 cup of  erythritol); a combo that which is cheaper then Swerve, and tastes much cleaner, more natural, like cane sugar... This home made combo is everything that Truvia wants to be but is not due to  it's bitter taste .","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6J116UHQORA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X71550#wasThisHelpful","R2R6J116UHQORA","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am crazy about the taste of this spread, and thought it was perfect for getting a way to get a little coconut fat every day. However, it contains CANOLA OIL! This is not good for those of us trying to avoid processed oils, and who are often trying to replace said oils with coconut oil.  So the whole point of using this coconut spread is MOOT because it contains overly processed canola oil. Big, big disappointment!

"By far, far, the best vegan protein powder I have ever used. Has the best taste and smoothest texture of all the vegan protein powders.  Yes, the ingredients are not raw or organic, and other products, such as Garden Of Life's popular Raw Protien, have much better ingredient lists. But they also have a much more earthy, dried plant-esque flavor, and often have a gritty texture. Plus GOL's Raw Protien upset my stomach.Vegan Sport on the other hand tastes much more neutral, and has a sweet kick due to the stevia. It's as close to a sweeter milkshake  tasting flavor as you are going to get in a vegan protein source. However, for hard-core vegans, and those that eat a lot of raw foods, and consume no sugars or sweeteners, this might be too sweet tasting of a choice. But for those of us who are semi vegetarians, and are looking for a vegetable-based protein supplement (and who are not overly concerned with raw or organic or sprouted ingredients ), and don't mind a little bit of sweet in our diet, Vegan Sport is a great tasting, and very smooth in texture, choice.  Plus the added supplements (BCAAs, enzymes)  can be a big plus as well.I have only tried the vanilla flavor, and it is much better with almond milk, particularly when mixed with an immersion blender; though it's tolerable when spooned mixed with cold water. I prefer the vanilla flavor, as I can add  cacao powder for a chocolate shake, or berries and fresh fruit for a thick fruit smoothie--that's the elegance of the plain vanilla, being able to use it as the base for any flavor I choose, or just on its own as plain and un-obtrusive vanilla.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QWATKH8W6J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H6UCHS#wasThisHelpful","R7QWATKH8W6J6","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of Cacoon's amber--green mirrored polarized lenses. They really do help to enhance detail, and I much prefer them over gray lenses. And while the MX shape is very sleek, modern and sexy, it lets in too much light with my wide Ray Ban eyeglass frames, and allows too much reflection off of the face. I have instead gone with Cacoon's Aviator model, which is much more ""sealed in""  and has much less reflection onto  the back of the lenses from my skin. However the Aviator model is much larger and goggle-like and not nearly as sleek as the MX style. I guess I chose function over style....","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILRNG4Y5Z4UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN48H96#wasThisHelpful","R3ILRNG4Y5Z4UU","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best fit-over style sunglasses I've tried, and I've tried many, including Jonathon Paul Fitovers (which has the most stylish frame styles,  but optically inferior lenses compared to Cacoons). The Amber Cacoon  lenses honestly increase contrast and help with vision under both sun and overcast, particularly helping with distance vision. I have the green mirrored lenses and they help to block even more light, but they are still not as dark and drab as some gray lenses I've tried. I had to get these in the BIG XL aviator style as they were the only ones to fit over my large Ray Ban eyeglass frames, and they are indeed big and a little goggle-like. However the green mirror lenses combined with the flat black matte frames really helps to jive them up, and cut back on the oversized, old-geezer  effect. The green mirrors really are attractive and youthful.There is always some reflection off of the face with fit-overs in bright sun, that you can see in the lens, but these reflections are not too bad with this XL Cacoon model.I have expensive Maui Jim prescription sunglasses, but hate switching back and forth between the prescriptions of them versus my regular (and superior) eyeglasses. I rarely wear them, and prefer to just slip on the Cacoons instead--as oversized as they are...!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YHXN7PTCW49N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLLGIAK#wasThisHelpful","R1YHXN7PTCW49N","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used this cleaner off and on for over 20 years, and it really is the best, most gentle overall cleaner. The grocery store cleaners with ammonia clean extremely well too--for diamonds, sapphires or rubies, even CZs, that are set in gold or unplated gold and sterling (including white rhodium plating over white gold and sterling). But as good as ammonia based cleaners are on sturdy jewlery, they are harsh for most other jewelry. Caribbean Gem is not harsh at all--you can even use it on pearls and doublets. Though I never soak things like pearls and doublets--such delicates only get a dunking and then a scrubbing.

Soaking is really for DIRTY pieces that haven't been cleaned in months or longer...!For a long time, I was cleaning my jewelry In a very strong mix of Palmolive (or Dawn) and water, thinking it was cheap and effective and saved me from making special online orders for this stuff. And strong, strong soapy water is a good cleanser, but I decided to give Caribbean Gem yet another try, and I'm glad I did, as it is much better than soapy water. The soapy water seems to leave a slight film, and Caribbean Gem does not--everything out of the Caribbean Gem just sparkles more.

I have some thin, thin rimless frames that not just slide, but go flying off my face--a BIG PITA! But with Nerdwax on their notepads they are now well behaved and stay put for hours before needing a small push up--such a transformation, I like wearing them now! For my already tight Ray Bans with only sporadic slippage, they never move now, all day! I ordered Nerdwax along side Wedgees, and have since sent the Wedgees back; yes Wedgees are highly rated and loved, but they are such an eye-sore for those of us that are fashion hounds that care about how our eyeglass frames look--I mean ""fins"" of neoprene?! Yecch! I MUCH prefer putting invisible coats of Nerdwax on the nose pads/bridge...!IME, Nerdwax really kicks in after a few base coats are applied. I recommend cleaning your pads/bridge with Q-tips and alcohol and then apply a few good coats of the wax--maybe a coat every hour for the first few hours. It then works really well, and stays on, even after washing with soap (I wash my glasses daily).

"The Kuhn Rikon Vase grinder is the best I have used, and converted me over from my beloved Magnum Pro pepper grinder after it broke. I decided to try this grinder after reading all of the raves for it on Amazon. This KR grinder is HUGE (I can't stress that enough). It is by far the largest ceramic grinder I have ever seen--and it grinds at a speed about 2/3 of what the Magnum can. BUT, it's grinding mechanism is smoother and quieter than the Magnum. It also far easier to adjust the grind size via a knob on the top of the grinder, and the size you select stays put (I had it change every so often on the Magnum); and the KR can grind MUCH finer than either the Magnum or any other ceramic grinder I have used (small Kuhn Rikon high output ratchet grinder, small Kyocera grinder). You can get almost a fine pepper powder with the KR. The Magnum got no where near this fine.As I said this grinder is HUGE--the reservoir holds a full cup of peppercorns, the same as my former beloved Magnum Plus. A full cup! Will last a long, long time. And filling it up is easy and a breeze. Much faster and easier than on the Magnum. No longer a patient Zen process as with the Magnum--with the KR I can now easily whip the top off, and fill it up while I am actually cooking and not get a single peppercorn on the counter top.Plus it sits upright, and like most other ceramic grinders, you turn it over to grind out your spice. So no more pepper on the counters as with the Magnum...!I am thrilled to have found a grinder/mill that meets all my needs--the only drawback is that the output is about a third less than the Magnum, but since the movement is smoother and easier and quieter, to me the less output is a null point. The output of the Kuhn Rikon Vase grinder is none the less hefty, and far and away enough for almost all users. Okay, if you were cooking for a few hundred every night, in a restaurant or commercial kitchen, yes, the Magnum's higher output could be a time saver.I got mine on Amazon for less than half the cost of the Magnum --$22 with tax and free shipping. I had it shipped along side a new Magnum Pro, with the intention that the loser would be returned. So I have printed out the return label and back the Magnum Pro is going.Happy to post this rave for the KR Vase grinder--this former Magnum fan is happily converted. If this mill is half as durable as my Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker, I'll continue to be thrilled.Plus it comes in a few colors so you can use them to grind everything from pepper to flax to whatever pleases you...And here's a YouTube video of the grinder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5yPQ...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HB070CHH74R0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Y82MR2#wasThisHelpful","R2HB070CHH74R0","A3E3MISWTTTNLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3MISWTTTNLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though I have received this item for testing purposes, this review is written based on my unbiased opinion. This toiletry bag is medium in size. It is spacious enough to accommodate a variety of hygiene products such as shampoo, brushes, toothpaste, etc. Ideal for travel, for tossing into a suitcase or small enough to throw into a larger purse or suitcase. The exterior zipper is strong and features a woven design that makes it easy to grip and zip.The bag is indeed waterproof, which in itself is rather impressive. So, if anything happens to spill inside of the bag, all of the surrounding contents are safe from damage. Unfortunately, the bag does not provide much room for organization.

"Keep in mind that this is a shortened version of ""A Brief History of Time"", which ironically is not so brief. This novel tackles life's big questions and contains issues we have all thought about. Some of us believe in a higher power, others believe that the big bang theory played some part in our creation. My thoughts align with the latter theory, so this book resonated with me. It kind of bridges the gap between an average Joe's level of understanding and Einsteins technical scientific terminology. I enjoyed reading this and wrapping my mind around black holes and other theories pondered by Hawking. I have read that some of Hawkings theories have been proven wrong over the years, but there is still enough information in this book to keep me wondering.

"Input: DC 5V-2AOutput: DC 5V-1ABefore buying this, make sure your phone is compatible with Qi Technology.This charger is very cool looking, I love the aesthetics. It's relative to the size of a drink coaster and is the shape of a disc. The contents of the box are- 1 Charger, Instruction Manual and a USB cord. I had to provide my own wall charger piece to make this work. It's pretty simple to set up. I just place my phone on the unit and the charger turns from a red dot to a blue light. My Note 5 charges well on it as long as it's already somewhat charged. I have not experienced any overheating.I like this charger because I can simply set my phone on the pod and it charges. No annoying scratches around my phones charging port. This is great because at night sometimes i'm half asleep and can't seem to find the phone's charging hole for the life of me. If the charger worked a little quicker it'd be worth 5 stars.

"Though I have received this product for testing purposes, my review is based on my unbiased opinion. This 7 pack of wash-cloths are designed for children, but can be used for anyone really. They are ultra-soft and unlike other baby rags, they are an accommodating size. Large enough to comfortably hold and apply a decent amount of soap to, they easily provide a nice lather. The washcloths feel nice dry, very soft on your skin when wet. These are machine washable and contain no dyes or harmful chemicals. The Father Son rag collection comes in a biodegradable box that can be recycled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASIDDU4F081M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017VIZC06#wasThisHelpful","RASIDDU4F081M","A1J6Z70T78B35V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6Z70T78B35V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this book is very informative, it isn't preachy. There are thousands of parenting books out there, and while a book can never fully prepare you for caring for a child, this offers a candid look at doing so. Becoming a Father offers a first time dad's look at raising an infant while teetering around a sometimes unhappy partner and still looking forward to the slightly easier years to come. There are a lot of tips regarding money saving and budget friendly ideas. For example, if trusted family members or friends offer childcare assistance, take them up on it. You will thank yourself when you save an arm and a leg on day care! In addition to suggestions, this book covers sleep-training, breast-feeding and beginning your baby on pureed foods.Geoffreys does not hold back, he takes an honest approach at introducing parenting to those new to the game. One of my favorite ideas is the idea that the father should be putting in just as much effort as the mother is. Just because there's an ideology of ""Maternal Instinct"" does not mean that Mom should be stuck doing all of the work! For anyone confused, or looking for ideas on how to care for and entertain your baby, this book offers step by step solutions and then some. I think this is a must-read for anyone who has a large role in a child's life, or who plans on having a baby in the future.

"This review is based on my unbiased opinion, I have received a copy of the ebook for testing purposes. Prior to reading, be sure you know that this is simply a condensed version of the book. For the women that fantasize about being perfectionists, this is a good read for you. I like the highlighted points, they get down to the heart of the matter without dancing around the subject. Women don't need to be perfect, just because we may feel self-conscious at times doesn't necessarily mean we are not good enough.Takeaway Point #1- ""The idea that women can do it all, perfect it all, and have it all is a farce that destroys happiness. Women need to choose to do the things they love and excel at, delegate the rest and let go of the guilt that comes from thinking they have to be perfect in every area of their lives.""This is a good way for not only women, but all of humanity to live their lives. Sometimes living with the idea of perfection does the opposite and spirals us downward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGBVNH06L1DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JTDBD4#wasThisHelpful","R2YGBVNH06L1DL","A1J6Z70T78B35V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6Z70T78B35V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you're a big fan of earbuds, you might find these a tad bit bulky, but it's worth the extra material. Each side folds in on itself and they are easily stored in the protective case that comes along with them. The headband adjusts to fit different shaped and sized heads with ease.I found the ear piece to be plushy and very comfortable to wear, they don't slip off my ears and don't cause sweating like other headphones tend to.While these may seem bulky, they are very light-weight and the case is convenient for carrying them around.The cord pops into the jack and is tangle-free. While the cord is not permanently attached to the headphones, it easily inserts. You will want to make sure the part with the volume adjuster is closest to the headphones.These headphones provide clear and full sound quality. I use these with my tablet to watch shows, listen to music and use them with my cell-phone to make calls. While earbuds are certainly more convenient for running, these are great for sitting at home and enjoying my favorite shows with full audio and action packed sound.While these headphones do produce a nice sound, they are not noise restrictive, so be mindful of others while you're rocking out ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GAHU9KNZWZIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R2GAHU9KNZWZIN","A1J6Z70T78B35V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6Z70T78B35V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can either choose a blinking display, or solid color. The panel charges via solar power and works as long as it's facing down (button side up).I love the way these lights look, they are not too bright and put off a gentle amount of purple light.

"This car garbage bag easily slides over the seat with a handy adjustable clasp. The sides expand so garbage can be packed in and the top Velcros, but doesn't zip. I wouldn't suggest putting anything too smelly in here, because it is going to be open and the odor will leak out. This bag is light-weight, the inside wipes out easily, but does not remove for washing purposes. There is Velcro on the bottom which allows you to latch the bag onto the floor's carpeting.

"This unit does little in the way of providing instructions, so I had to do a little detective work and play around with the lantern. There are 5 different modes which range from Ultra Bright to Dim and include a strobe light feature. The lantern has a carabiner on the back that allows you to attach it to a lanyard or key-chain. The charging port is USB compatible and protected from dust and dirt by a rubber stopper. This light is ideal for camping, reading or general usage at night.

"Something I really enjoyed about this book is that it isn't preachy, rather set in a conversational tone. This book explains how to feel a little more at ease when talking to the opposite sex, and confidence really does attract interest.

"This fishing kit is about the size of a half dollar coin and is filled to the gills! There is everything you would need in a jam or for a spur of the moment fishing trip. Included in the miniature tin is fishing line, hooks, lures and sinkers to attach to the line. It takes a bit of expertise to effectively stick all of the lures and fishing tools back into the small container, but once you are able to pop the top back on, you're good to go. This compact set is small enough to toss in your box, pocket or purse and great for anyone to have on hand.

"Let me start off by saying that though this is a series, I jumped in at this chapter and was not left in the dark, this operates somewhat as a stand alone version. The author has a way of connecting the characters to the reader that is somewhat inviting and that's what kept me reading. Each character is complex and has something to add to the book. There are moments that are bittersweet and I really enjoyed the story line. This is one of those books that keeps you wrapped up in everything that's going on.One of the only downfalls for me, being that i'm a word nerd, is there are a lot of grammatical errors. Reading and having misspellings pop out at me kind of drives me crazy and takes away from the story a little bit. Aside from the errors, this is a decent book with a good story line and I am intrigued, looking forward to reading the series from the beginning when I have time.

Everything is broken down into steps that really help you take a good look at who you are as a person and a partner. These steps are an effective way of helping you realize who a good partner would be for yourself.I thought this book was well written, detailed and includes advice and chains of action that can be easily applied to someone looking for their ideal partner. This is really an insightful guide at looking at yourself and what needs to be fixed to create the best version of yourself BEFORE making a commitment to someone else.

"I bought this book purely out of nostalgia. I don't have kids, but this was my very favorite book as a little girl and I never forgot it. After treating my childhood rag doll to a new dress recently, a one-armed doll with tattered toes that I've loved for over 40 years, I remembered this book and was thrilled to find it still available. It tells the story of a little girl who gets invited to a party where there will be a doll contest. She has antique dolls, fancy dolls, dolls that do things, and then she has her favorite doll, who is a bit ragged and worn from years of love. Her loyalty to her beloved doll is rewarded at the party and there is a wonderful moral about staying true to yourself and being proud of who you are, even when you might feel inferior. The story is full of simple dialogue, and near the beginning the dolls themselves have secret conversations with each other when ""their"" little girl is out of the room, and I always loved the idea of that.Originally written in 1962, the book itself is somewhat dated on one hand, in that there is some slightly outdated wording like ""I shall"", ""your dress is a fright"", etc. But on the other hand it's a truly timeless story that outshines any slightly dated language. I actually like the older-style wording, it makes it fun to read. It's a classic! The illustrations are simple, using only the colors of lavender, black and gray. But they're still very expressive, showing that sometimes the simplest of drawings can portray a whole lot of emotion. Personally, I was very relieved to see the original artwork being used in this newer edition, it wouldn't have been the same with updated drawings, but again, I come from the perspective of nostalgia.I absolutely loved books as a kid and had hundreds of them, donating boxes full to the library every year as I accumulated new ones. But this one stands out by far as my favorite, even after all these years. I am very pleased to have found it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U1VLIFL7O63C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805054677#wasThisHelpful","R2U1VLIFL7O63C","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, what a difference. I only really started listening to podcasts a couple years ago. I heard about the Stitcher app, it was referenced on NPR, so I assumed it was probably one of the best out there, for free at least. So I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and have been using it exclusively for about a year or more. Before that I had only listened to podcasts online or on my desktop computer so Stitcher was the only podcast app I had ever used. I really love listening to podcasts at night, as I fall asleep. But two big things were making me crazy with Stitcher: One; that it has a glaring white screen, which is bothersome when I'm trying to get into 'sleepy mode' in bed. And two; it had a 'continuous play' feature that I could never manage to find a way to turn off. So I'd choose one podcast episode to play, start to fall asleep, and just when I was asleep it would start playing the next podcast. This was very annoying because I would deliberately choose some subdued, quiet-type podcast to fall asleep to, and then suddenly some other loud obnoxious podcast would wake me up. It got to the point where I rarely listened at bedtime anymore, and started listening to audiobooks instead. Their website shows an option to turn off continuous play, but I could never find the setting options they referred to on my Kindle, I just don't think my version offered a way to disable it.SO: My point in all that history is to say that I have neither problem with Podcast Addict, Hooray! It has a nice dark interface which is much more soothing on my eyes while in bed. Additionally, it has the option to stop playing once the current podcast is over, which I LOVE. Now I can fall asleep to the chosen episode and only the chosen episode, and as I drift off it eventually shuts up! The option is a little quirky however, there's a box to check ""Stop playing after current episode"", which in theory should stop at the end of the episode *no matter what*. But under that is a timer to select whether to stop playing after a selected period of time, anything to one minute to many hours. Strangely, the 'stop playing after current episode' box being checked does NOT override the timer IF the timer is set to a time that's shorter than the episode. So in addition to checking the 'stop after current episode' box, I have to also make sure the timer is set for a very long period of time (say three hours for example) in order for a shorter episode (say 30-60 minutes) to stop when it should - without cutting it off too early. So it's a little glitch but not a big deal now that I've figured out that I can just keep the timer set for several hours at all times and then check the 'end after episode' box before bed, since everything I listen to is never more than 3 hours. I would have deducted a star for this flaw but since I figured out how to work around it I'm happy. The bottom line is that I am thrilled to be able to have a sleep option even though it's not perfect.Another thing I've discovered which surprised me is that when I searched for my regular podcasts, this app pulled up many more available episodes in several cases than were offered on Stitcher. I just assumed the number of available episodes were set by the podcast itself, it never occurred to me that a different app might offer more episodes, so that's very exciting. Additionally, I've also found a few podcasts on Podcast Addict that I searched for on Stitcher but could never find.There are a lot of settings and options, some a bit confusing, some not, and I'm still learning my way around. I haven't utilized half of the features yet, but already this is a BIG improvement from Stitcher. It's more visually appealing and offers more customization options. I am really enjoying it. There is a banner ad across the bottom of the screen, but I don't really mind it and the overall improvement over Stitcher is totally worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13J1H0C2229HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNGA1PS#wasThisHelpful","R13J1H0C2229HL","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclaimer, I am extremely slipper picky. I am home all day and I wear slippers all day long inside the house and often outside in the yard if I am running outside for a brief chore. I prefer the 'bootie' style for ankle warmth, and outdoor soles are a must, especially in the winter when I often step outside onto the snowy deck to grab firewood. So I saw these, and while they're a little more expensive than I would prefer, they seemed to fit the bill.They are very comfortable. Soft inner sole, not overly cushy but not hard either. The furry lining is extremely soft, as is the outer material. One thing I love is the outer sole. It's genuinely outdoor-friendly, in that the rubber portion covers the entire bottom of the slipper and also wraps up around the edges. Too many times I've bought cheap slippers that have what appears to be an outdoor sole but it doesn't extend all the way to the very edges of the foot and I end up with damp feet if I run outside. So the soles get an A++ in that regard. Additionally, they are lightweight, the sole and the overall slipper, which I like. I've purchased some with good outdoor soles, but they often feel like winter boots and are just too heavy to be lounging around the house in. These feel light as slippers should, but still have a good sole.One thing I don't like however, is that the split on the outer side of the ankle portion is too wide/open. The split is cut way too low, so that they essentially hang open, which defeats the purpose of keeping my ankles warm. So the result is drafty ankles! The wide open cut also catches on pant legs too causing my pant leg to lift up, which is mildly annoying. I've been pondering sewing the flap shut, it doesn't look as 'wide-open' in the photo as it is in person. The toggle button is at the bottom of the opening, making it useless; it would be nice if that were higher so I could actually close the gap around my ankles! Also, when I walk I notice my heels lift up inside the slipper quite a bit. They don't fall off and it's not uncomfortable, but it's a loose feeling in the heel and I'm quite sure it's because of the wide-open cut at the sides. The actual foot size is perfect, so they aren't too big.Speaking of size: I wear a 7.5 in most shoes and boots, and occasionally a 7.0 in dress shoes or sandals. However, I had a weird feeling that I should order these in an 8, especially since I always wear socks with slippers, and I am glad I did because the 8 fits perfectly, with no room to spare. Comfortable, but anything less would be tight. I only have one other pair of shoes (out of dozens of boots, shoes and slippers) that's a size 8 and that's a pair of rain boots. So I can safely say these run slightly small. The width however is perfect, I got a medium width as I usually do in other shoes.They go on and off easily and are generally very comfortable. Like I said, I love that the sole is genuinely outdoor-friendly while still being lightweight and slipper-like. The actual foot portion is very nice, I only wish the side vents weren't cut so low, my ankles are chilly even as I type, no joke. I may have to attach large safety pins or something to hold them closed.EDITED TO ADD: I did add safety pins to close the side gaps, a full two inches up from the button, and there's still nearly two more inches of open split above the pins. Still plenty of room to get them on and off, but it's an improvement. I only hope the material doesn't rip from being pinned, time will tell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21D378RJAWE3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC69XEQ#wasThisHelpful","R21D378RJAWE3T","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item at a special promotional price, and was anxious to try it out. I had a Bodum brand french press many years ago when I was young and hip and living in New York City, and my roommates and I had some wonderful deep talks sitting around a pot of coffee in our Brooklyn apartment. But alas; time has passed, I'm not so young and I've long since lost my dear old Bodum (one of those roommates probably stole it), so this offer reminded me how much I enjoyed my first french press. Unlike the Bodum I had, this Kona french press has a plastic design surrounding the glass so that it won't break easily, and also for aesthetics I assume. It has a nice roomy handle that would fit all hands. The lid (which the coffee/tea comes in contact with) is made of BPA-free plastic, so no worries there, and the carafe is borosilicate glass, which is both lightweight and durable, within reason. This is still an item you want to treat carefully however. I personally hand wash mine, just rinsing it out immediately after use with warm water. It comes with a handy little scoop and basic but clear directions. It was also very well packaged, wrapped in bubble wrap inside the box, which eliminated my concern that it might break in transit. It arrived safe and sound.These days I only drink one cup of coffee in the morning, and sometimes a second later in the day, so a full carafe isn't desired for my routine. However, I have become a big fan of loose tea, so I was curious how it would work for tea. I do drink a few cups of tea at a time, especially in the cold winter months, so this makes the perfect amount. Additionally, I often become impatient waiting for loose tea to fully steep, so now I can pour a cup after waiting just a few minutes, and the remaining portion becomes stronger while I am enjoying the first cup, which is perfect. So while most of the reviews seem to praise it for coffee making, I personally find it most useful for loose tea.The only thing I don't care for is the construction of the fragile screen. It's nice and has an ultra fine mesh, but there is no grommet in the center, so it may become frayed around the center cut-out after some use. I would highly recommend that the manufacturer add a grommet! So I had to deduct one star based on that. Otherwise I have no complaints and am very happy to be a french presser hipster once again after so many years without one. :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGL4PNX1629B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMJDJ5C#wasThisHelpful","RGL4PNX1629B1","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't do a whole lot of driving, so I'm still learning my way around this unit. This is my first GPS unit of any kind, I don't even have a smart phone. I moved several years ago and have yet to really learn my way around beyond the basic errands I do, so I thought this might help me explore a little more with less apprehension about getting lost, and it's great for that. I borrowed my neighbor's vehicle once and used his TomTom and liked it. He said he never had any issues with his so I saved myself a lot of brand-comparing and ordered the same thing he has. I don't use a lot of the features, but it's great for getting me where I need to go. Setup was less than stellar, it kept alerting me that there were more updates than what initially downloaded, but couldn't seem to finish the updates. I just plugged it into my vehicle at that point to see how it worked and it's been there ever since.Some things I like are: The view is clear and easy to follow, it shows where I should turn right where I am on the road, no misleading distances, etc. It saves my place if I stop mid-route and when I restart it asks if I want to resume to the original destination that I had interrupted, so that's handy. I love the ETA feature, I hate trying to guess when I'll arrive somewhere. Another thing I like is that if I know of a better route, or one that I just prefer, I can go off course and after a brief reminder to 'turn around', it will re-calculate the route and pick up on my new course.Some things I don't love so much are: The speed it shows I'm driving is off, it shows I'm going about 5 mph slower than I actually am. This is annoying because I find it so much easier to refer to the screen than to my vehicle's speedometer (due to my steering wheel position of choice), but I keep having to remember that I'm going faster than I think. One other thing I find mildly annoying is that it constantly tries to avoid dirt roads. That might be great for some people, but I live in a very rural area where there are tons of dirt roads that I rely on, plus I drive a Jeep, so I dislike that it tries to avoid them. There may be a way fix that, I'm not sure yet. It will re-calculate the route after a couple minutes however, so it's not a big deal.Like I said, I know I'm not using this device to its full potential, but it does what I want: Gets me where I want to go. And it's very user friendly, prompting me through simple steps to enter a destination. And then it remembers my recent destinations making them easy to recall from a list so I don't need to re-enter it each time. It also has a ""Home"" button which is great to get back from anywhere with a single touch of a button. I'll add more to this review if I discover anything important to mention, but already I'm glad I purchased it. Totally worth the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSSA99FAF7X1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M52QR6#wasThisHelpful","RWSSA99FAF7X1","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a bummer, seemed like a good price, I should have known it was too good to be true. I am typically a size 8 in clothes, so a Medium would be my usual choice. But I read in the description that they ""fit snug"" and to order one size up ""for a looser fit"", which in theory should have been a Large but they were out of Large so I ordered XL, not minding if they were a bit big since I figured they'd shrink some being 100% cotton. The size chart shows XL being about a size 14, so these should have been plenty big! Well, they're tiny! Like TINY, they might fit a 12 year old child. They were extremely short in the arms and the legs. The legs stopped at my calf, like Capris. And the seams were strange, they felt twisted and weird no matter how much I tried to adjust them on my body, it was just ridiculous. I couldn't even figure out which was front or back on the pants because they felt strange and uncomfortable either way. And there was also a very strong chemical odor that still lingered after I repacked them and washed my hands. The only good thing I can report is that the colors (tan and blue, I ordered two sets) were accurate. Complete waste of money, I very rarely bother returning anything and I immediately packed these back up to send back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWQ5J5RQV36K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RKJU6C#wasThisHelpful","R1CWQ5J5RQV36K","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Claritin for years. Well, I should say until I discovered generic versions of Loratadine 10mg. For the last five or six years I've been using a lesser known brand called Ohm, which was a good price at $10 for a bottle of 100 pills on Prime. I ran out and went to reorder and couldn't find the Ohm brand on Prime this time around, and I really prefer Prime delivery. So I searched around and saw this Kirkland brand - 365 pills for only a couple bucks more than I have been paying for 100 pills! Great deal! I've used Kirkland products before, I use their acetaminophen (generic Tylenol) and it works just fine. I believe it's Costco's ""house brand"", as I've seen Kirkland products there quite often. Kirkland's brand of these are oval as opposed to the usual round pill, but they're still tiny and easy to swallow. I've never had any issues with generic medications, they all seem to work the same, so I ordered this and I'm very happy with the price. I take 10mg of Loratadine every day for general pet/dust allergies as well as to prevent chronic hives and have never experienced any side effects, although Loratadine in general is a type that needs to get and stay into your system for the best ongoing effect, it's not really meant as a quick fix for immediate relief, just an FYI. I'm thrilled to have found a year's supply at an even better price than I was paying for the Ohm brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28GH4IJN3C5H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ASER98#wasThisHelpful","R28GH4IJN3C5H6","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little unsure about trying this brand, I've been buying ""Ecotools"" brand in local stores for several years and love them. I decided to check online prices this time and should have known there would be cheaper brands. I was really hoping the quality and texture would be close to Ecotools brand and it is. The size is the same as Ecotools brand. The texture is actually slightly rougher, only very slightly, but to me that's a good thing because I like the exfoliating effect.I use these primarily on my face, they're more convenient than a wash cloth, I can just rinse it and leave it to dry. I also keep a second one handy to use under my arms to freshen up between showers. And when they finally get old I even use them on my bathroom sink and faucets before finally tossing them, just to get as much use out of them as possible. Hopefully these will last as long as the Ecotools brand did, I don't see any major difference in them, so they should work out fine. One thing I do miss is the individual wrapping that Ecotools brand has, since they're preserved to stay moist, I think the single wrappers were better than one bag that doesn't reseal. I'll just keep them in a large ziplock bag and on the plus side it wastes less packaging.By the way, a couple other reviews mentioned this as a package of 12, but as of my purchase and review it's TWO packages of 12, so that's 24 sponges total for the price, which is what I read in the title at the time of my order and what I received.

"I'm really mad. I was looking forward to receiving this after reading a bunch of nice reviews. I received it today and it's cheap junk. There are no dovetail joint corners as shown (they're just glued together with straight, rough edges), the top doesn't have the nice rounded edges as shown, instead rough angular edges. The inside divider unit is misaligned so that some of the compartments are warped, and there are actual splintered edges all over this box - to the point that you can't wipe it down with a rag without it catching all over the place. I can literally run my hands along and get splintered or just pull loose pieces of wood slivers right off. I re-checked both the listing photo and other customer photos and it is absolutely NOT the same box. Then I noticed just in the last few days a couple of other brand new reviews saying the same thing, so they are obviously sending out cheap substitutes now instead of the nicer ones that the older reviews are referring to. I needed this as a display for an event so I didn't return it, I'll cut my losses and stick it in the cabinet until it breaks which won't be long, but it certainly is not the nice display box that is shown. I feel genuinely cheated.**Update July 31 2015** I kept getting emails from the seller saying the item was delivered but I didn't leave feedback, even though I posted this review on the very day I received the item. So I finally wrote back so they would stop emailing me and said I had in fact left a review and that I was not happy at all, that it was not as shown, no dovetail joints, splintering in places, etc and they wrote back and said: ""Ok thanks"". That's it, no ""gee, sorry to hear that"", no ""that's not how they should be"", nothing. Granted, I didn't ask for a refund, but they don't seem the least bit concerned with customer satisfaction so I felt it was important to add that to this review. The only thing worse than a poor quality product is a company who obviously doesn't care that you are unhappy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HK1UV1U2LRBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MM79X2#wasThisHelpful","R1HK1UV1U2LRBI","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is perfect for my needs! I live in the woods with little direct sun so I try to grow herbs and tomatoes in containers on my deck, which gets the best amount of sun. But the tomatoes still struggle, they really need sun all day. I don't know why I didn't think of getting one of these sooner; now I can roll my tomato plant around the deck throughout the day to always be in the best sun. This is well made and I really like the natural wood look. Came out of the box as seen here, wheels attached. I hope it weathers well spending summers on the deck, time will tell. It's 12"" square, which fits my 5 gallon bucket perfectly. I don't use a planter, I use a big ol' regular 5 gallon bucket to get the most root depth possible. I was a little worried when I ordered because the bucket full of soil is heavy, but it seems fine on this. It rolls right over my spaced deck boards with no trouble at all. It has a lovely wood-burned tree detail in the corner, the tree on mine is larger than the one in the photo which I barely noticed when ordering, but I like it, it's a nice touch.

"Well, these aren't as big as I thought they would be from reading the other reviews, I was hoping for a jumbo size, but they are slightly bigger than the regular size that they seem to be making these days. I've attached a photo of my old regular one next to this size for comparison. Not a big difference, but it's still an improvement and they are easier to handle. The finish is a bit rough on many of them, I hope they'll smooth out with use. Some of them are sort of twisted- meaning not lined up, and I'm wondering if they'll start coming apart, but so far they've worked fine. Notice in my comparison photo that the spring is much higher: that seemed weird at first but the advantage is that there is more to fit down over the line and clothes. However, I have chronic pain in my hands so I was hoping the size difference would have been in the part that I squeeze at the top, which is not any bigger.

"When my clothesline broke after five years, I made the mistake of researching different types of clothesline materials, which nearly drove me bonkers. I wasn't sure what my original one was, but it seemed mostly synthetic. I checked out my neighbor's and he had cotton. So many pros and cons, cotton holds knots better but sags more, synthetic is harder to knot but might last longer, plastic coated metal seemed sturdy but how easy would that be to put up, would I need extra hardware to clasp it or would the coating crack? WAY too many factors for what should have been a simple purchase. After reading 8 million reviews on Amazon and other various articles, I decided on this one: Cotton but with a ""synthetic core"". Seemed like a good compromise, would knot well and yet hopefully sag less. Only time will tell, and I will update this if anything drastic happens, but so far it seems like a good choice.It was wound well, so unraveling was pain-free, no crazy tangles. I restrung it to my existing pulleys with ease and in only a few minutes. It knotted very easily much to my relief. Hung a full line of clothes and it does sag somewhat but so did my old one, I can't say it sags any unusual amount and I add a ""spreader"" to decrease sagging. I HIGHLY recommend a tensioner for clotheslines, it makes it so easy, you only have to make one knot to the one end of the tensioner, then you can just feed the other end of the line through the other end of the tensioner. Tightening is easier later with one too, just pull it a little tighter, no untying anything. It's slightly thicker than the synthetic one I had, but fits my pins fine and seems sturdy. I do notice the weave is looser than what I'm used to though, so I'm hoping it won't fray very quickly, but only time will tell. The price was great. If I can get another five years from this one, I'll be perfectly happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJGJ7UQQ4FG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKA48OQ#wasThisHelpful","RJJGJ7UQQ4FG3","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My bunny is five years old and I have religiously bought the same brand food (Blue Seal) from my local feed store, because it's good quality and much cheaper than small(er) brand name bags like this. But I found myself in a pickle when my car was in the shop longer than expected and I ran out of food, so I ordered this on 2 day delivery to hold him over. Because I'm used to larger quantity feed store prices, this wasn't any bargain for me, but among the choices on Amazon it seemed like the best deal for a 10 pound bag. I fed it to my bunny and at first he didn't eat it, which made me nervous because he always dives right into his food. He waited awhile, and finally gave it a try. I guess the change took him aback a little, given that he's eaten the same brand for five years. In any case he took to it well enough after the initial hesitation. The pellets are slightly longer in length and also harder than what I normally get, but he doesn't seem to object.

"My clothesline is the pulley type, about 40 or so feet long, but I'd say about 35 feet of usable space since one end is under a tree so I don't hang anything on that end. I had a plastic 'clothespin with a hook thingie' that I was using to lift the gap when the laundry hung too low; I'd clip it to the lower line and hook it to the top line. That worked well enough for a few years. This year my clothesline finally broke, and while I was researching what type of new line to get (cotton, synthetic, etc) I discovered this gadget, that much to my surprise was designed specifically for what I had been using my clip thingie for. Not sure how I got through 40-something years not knowing these existed, but I ordered it along with my new line.I was, and still am, slightly confused about how the design is supposed to work, since some of these only have one wheel and others like this model have two. I imagine it's supposed to slide along as I hang laundry. It does technically do that, but I find it creates a drag on the movement of the line and my line pulleys along much quicker and smoother without it. I'm also never really sure where the line will droop at it's lowest, depending on what type of items I hang and where - it's not always lowest in the center. So I use it differently than I think it's meant to be used: I hang all my clothes, then find the lowest point, walk over and put this wherever that lowest point is. It works fine that way, so I'm satisfied even though I'm not really utilizing it in the way it's intended - it could essentially have no wheels and still suit the way I am using it, but who cares, it does the job of eliminating the sag. For my length line, two of these would have been ideal, but one is JUST good enough. I like that it's sturdy metal so it should last a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O13DA76O8NXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036BMO0O#wasThisHelpful","R3O13DA76O8NXV","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very hopeful about this product because earlier this year I ordered their Puracy Dish Liquid and absolutely love it, it works great. So I was anxious to try this stain remover. However, upon opening the box I discovered the screw top cap had come loose and it had leaked all over the place, I removed the bagged bottle from the box and the bag was dripping everywhere and it had also leaked out of the bag and got all over another product that came in the same box. This is especially aggravating because this **same exact thing** happened with their dish liquid, one of the pop-tops had popped up and one of the three bottles had leaked and made a mess. At that time I typed in my review for the dish liquid that it was probably an unfortunate shipping accident but having happened TWICE now I blame Puracy for not having seals on their bottles. It's crazy to just screw on a lid, ship liquid and hope for the best. So I lost a good portion of product, and that makes me angry because with my tight budget, this is a lot of money to spend on a bottle that isn't even full upon arrival - not to mention the mess.So once I cleaned everything up I tested it out on several stained items, marking the stains with pins. The pins turned out to be unnecessary since all of the stains were clearly still there after washing. One stain on an apron had faded slightly, and two other stains on a kitchen towel and on a shirt were both still there, although to be fair all three stains are old stains so I don't expect miracles. I left them for about 45 minutes to an hour respraying a couple times to keep it wet, but I did not scrub the stains with a brush, so for now I'll say the jury is still out on how it works - I will try it again with fresh stains, and I will also try scrubbing the stain next time. I'll be sure to update this review if my next load produces better results. However, due to the fact that I have ordered Puracy products twice now and BOTH times they leaked all over the place, I'm thinking I will not likely order again until they come to their senses and start adding seals to the bottles. I hate to be harsh, but I also hate wasting my money. It's a shame too, because I really am a big fan of their dish washing soap.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHXCV3JHF0HN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISDMQ8U#wasThisHelpful","R3LHXCV3JHF0HN","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fun purchase. I started out searching for a couple of specific stones for my personal meditation & healing use, and was surprised at how expensive they are individually. I ended up seeing this Chakra Set, and the price worked out to be much better value. Plus, I am new to Chakras and have always wanted to learn more, so this seemed like a nice, all-inclusive kit to start me off with.To get my only real ""complaint"" out of the way first: The tip of the Pendulum was broken off and missing, so that was a bummer. However, I am not deducting any stars out of fairness to the seller because they clearly state in the CD literature to contact them if disappointed before leaving a bad review. I don't want to return the broken pendulum because there is a section on the CD that talks about the stones 'choosing us' and finding their way into our lives. I don't want my perfectionism to cloud what is perhaps meant to be mine, however flawed. So I can't fairly deduct a star, I'm sure they would have exchanged it if I asked.On to more positive things! It was very exciting to open (this would be an awesome gift), all stones are separated into the chakras, 3 for each chakra in a plastic zip bag along with a satin pouch and and an ID/info card. A few seemed a bit small, but most were a good variety of sizes. There were substitutions on a few stones, so that's something to be aware of. One of the substitutions turned out to be my favorite of the set, so it's not necessarily a bad thing! I did a fun thing, going though each one and jotting down my feelings from each, without looking at the descriptions first. Then I looked up the properties and was amazed at how accurately my feelings matched the property descriptions!The stones in the travel pouch are smaller, presumably on purpose to make them lighter to travel with. There is lots of stuff on the CD, although to be honest the majority of it has little-to-nothing to do with stones or chakras; it's a variety of random things from 'living green' advice, poems, and self-improvement stuff. Sort of a positive-vibe Grab-Bag of PDF files. Be aware it only works on a PC. There IS info on the stones and chakras on the CD as well, enough to give me a beginner orientation on the chakras and stones. Just enough info to save me from buying separate beginner books on Chakras and/or stones/crystals. All in all I feel like this package was very thoughtfully put together, and it's a fantastic starter kit for someone like myself, who is new to Chakras and healing stones. I am excited to begin using them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPMKOWIB26ARU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOASX18#wasThisHelpful","RPMKOWIB26ARU","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prices on Amazon products fluctuate frequently, but at the time I placed my order this listing had an Amazon instant coupon that made it cheaper than buying large boxes, so although I didn't require the snack size bags, it was actually more cost effective. It might also help with portion control this way, which would be good. These arrived on time and in good condition. Inside the shipping box was another sturdy box which was a Cheez-it manufacturer box with a punch-out opening so it can be used as a dispensing box which is handy. The expiration isn't until 6 months from now, and they'll be long since devoured by then. They taste fresh and how Cheez-its normally taste when I buy them from the store. They're a bit crammed into the box, so some may be broken up as I get deeper into the box, but so far they've been fine. No loose ones or opened bags as others have reported. Exactly 36 bags. These will also be good for throwing in a purse to take with me on errand days for a quick snack without wasting more money at a store.

"I often use cheap little notebooks in my bags and purses for lists, errands, price shopping, etc., but I use them so much that I've become picky, spiral bound ones get caught on things, top bound ones offer no privacy when writing notes to myself close to others, and some are just so cheap that the pages fall out. I saw my neighbor with one of these and I loved it. His was very beat up too, yet still in one piece so I was sold. He said he gets them at Staples so I went on the website ready to order and found them going for $11.00 EACH - forget that! I am so glad I decided to check the price here on Amazon, where I found this pack of 6 for less than the price of one at Staples. I read another review saying the quality was comparable to Staples and I immediately ordered. The other reviewer was right, these are absolutely identical to the ones Staples offers, durable flexible covers, good paper, and fabric covered, threaded bindings.The pages have four columns, small on the left, medium center and two more small ones on the right. I don't care about the columns actually, I usually just get lined pages with no columns, but the columns might come in handy for adding up smaller shopping lists or keeping track of errand spending. These books are a great size, a little bigger than a checkbook, so I can easily find it in my larger bags but it's still small enough to tuck into a coat pocket or small purse. These came in perfect condition, packaged in a sturdy manufacturer's box, so the extras can be conveniently stored without getting separated or beat up. Now that I have six of them, I'm thinking of other uses too; I might use one as a birding/nature log for hikes, they'd be useful for all sorts of things; a great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBT6GNSNMICBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6L48ZS#wasThisHelpful","RBT6GNSNMICBR","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have Eczema and use a body lotion constantly during the winter months. But I was looking for a treatment lotion or ointment to use on specific itchy areas that were especially bad. I read that Hydrocortisone cream is actually bad to use on a regular basis as it thins the skin membranes and make you itchier with prolonged use, so I wanted something to replace that. This had great reviews and I saw several mentions of people using it for Eczema so I thought I'd give it a try. I've done quite a bit of reading on Eczema and medicated products like this aren't generally recommended for the record, but when you get desperate you'll try anything to stop an itch.Anyway, this seems like a decent product and it will be nice to have on hand, but it didn't do much for my itch; the effect was very mild. It's better to have on hand for insect bites and that sort of thing. Incidentally, I put it away after a few uses and thought to review it today when I took it back out to use for a bug bite. It ""helps"" but doesn't stop the itch, both on the eczema and the bug bite. I will use this as needed and it's certainly better than nothing, but I probably would not buy it again. Oh, It does have a strong menthol scent, so be aware of that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNK4WZ5UAQH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000536EW#wasThisHelpful","R1BNK4WZ5UAQH1","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in my early 40's and purchased this for occasional use because I suffered a knee injury a few years ago that periodically acts up and I'm forced to take my weight off it for about a week each time until it heals. Ultimately I need surgery, but this will have to do for now in addition to my knee brace. So I'm new to canes and have nothing to compare this to in that regard. I knew I definitely wanted something that folded up since I only use it once or twice a year. The handle is wood and although that sounded nice in the description I didn't anticipate how uncomfortable that would be on my hand, it really digs in. It's smooth and well-shaped, but with the injury I'm forced to really lean on it and it's a bit uncomfortable. It could also be that I'm just not used to a cane.The color is pretty, feminine and a blend of peach and pink tones and the handle is a very dark brownish-red that appears black at a glance. It folds and unfolds easily, although a rubber band is needed to keep it folded up. It's adjustable, although I would warn prospective buyers to pay attention to the adjustment span of 33""-37"". According to the instructions, you should take your height in inches and divide by two and the resulting number should match the height of the cane. I'm 5'5"" and when I divide 65"" by two I get 32.5"" which is actually shorter than this cane goes. In my case it's ""close enough"" at it's lowest, but I've never considered myself to be short and yet I'm apparently at the very minimum height to use this cane properly, which surprises me, so just be sure to check your needed measurements.I was disappointed to discover the ""carrying case"" is a disposable piece of junk; I saw similar canes with nylon drawstring bags here on Amazon but this came with a junky clear plastic thing that I would not consider a proper case. It has sharp edges and I expect it will tear apart easily. It will do since I only take it out a couple times a year, but if I used this more regularly I would have to go find some sort of real case for sure because this one is a joke. Even with my complaints however, this cane will still suit my particular needs for occasional use and I feel the price was mostly fair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBBFC9FRO59Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009STMYS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBBFC9FRO59Z","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Eczema recently came back after 30 years of being in remission much to my surprise and horror. But because it's been so long I had no clue what's currently out there for eczema products. I found the NEA website (National Eczema Association) and it's been very helpful. I was on their Facebook page one day and saw a couple of people recommended this Curel 'Itch Defense' formula. I have to be honest, Curel is one of the last companies I would ever think to turn to for this type of product; I know they're a fairly popular brand, but I just didn't think of them as making ""serious"" products for skin conditions. But I went to Curel's website and checked it out.Sure enough, it's a fragrance-free formula designed for eczema and with ingredients I was told to look for and none of the ingredients I was told to avoid. Two things sold me on trying it: 1. It had the NEA Seal of Acceptance. That's a big deal, that means they went through vigorous tests and reformulating in order to meet the criteria of the NEA's standards, including avoiding all ingredients on the NEA's known list of irritants. 2. The price! I had spent hours comparing labels on some very expensive eczema-friendly moisturizers and here was one that seemed to fit the bill AND came in a huge 20 ounce bottle for a very fair price.The lotion is thicker than I expected, somewhere between a lotion and a cream in thickness. It's white but slightly translucent which reflects the highly emollient ingredients like petrolatum and dimethicone. Both are said to be excellent for eczema but many eczema moisturizers will have one or the other, this has both. It goes on thick but spreads VERY nicely. It's definitely on the heavy side, you can really feel that ""barrier"" on the skin. That's exactly what eczema patients need, a moisture barrier on their skin - not a lotion that disappears/evaporates, but the downside to that is that I personally find it an annoying feeling, a slight tackiness on the skin that lingers for a long time, but I'll live.I did get immediate (albeit not total) relief of my INSANE itching. It didn't disappear entirely, but I got relief of the worst of it and some areas have stopped itching, so it's still a huge improvement. I've started using it in two ways: Putting it all over my body morning and night and after showers, and also ""spot treating"" areas, spreading a small amount like an ointment on an area that starts itching out of the blue - it soothes the itch enough for me to leave it alone and I repeat that as needed. I've decided this: I do still need to find a specific treatment cream or ointment to put on the worst areas during flare-ups, but this Curel formula is excellent for after showers to seal in moisture and for general use all over my body on a daily basis during dry winter months. I have to admit I've misjudged Curel; it turns out this is an excellent quality formula that I probably would not have tried if it weren't for the NEA Seal on the bottle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6OSCDLWCE4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046OFO3Y#wasThisHelpful","RZ6OSCDLWCE4I","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently diagnosed with Eczema, I've been on a non-stop mission to find 'all things non-irrating' to replace all my personal and household products which aggravate my eczema. This said it's suitable for ""hands, face and body"", and is free of a whole bunch of common irritants and is fragrance-free so I gave it a try. I bought one for my bathroom sink and one for the kitchen sink, and will probably add it to my shower too if I can't find a suitable body wash. It makes my hands feel nice and clean: not stripped but not moisturized from extra crap, just CLEAN. I almost forgot what plain ol' clean feels like because most hand soaps have added garbage that moisturize, exfoliate, etc. This does nothing fancy, it just gives you an honest, simple clean.I washed my face with it and I always have to moisturize immediately afterward because my skin is very dry, but just for the sake of testing this product, I didn't moisturize right away. My skin didn't have that tight and itchy feeling, which was refreshing indeed. I do still need to moisturize my face, but my test showed that it's at least not harsh in any way. It has a nice lather, semi-low lathering but still enough to satisfy the senses and feels silky in the hands.My only complaint is the price. These are small bottles. There is a larger refill bottle but I still feel it's a bit on the pricey side in my opinion. I will continue to buy it, but like I said above, if I can find a less expensive eczema-friendly product for body wash I will, and reserve this for face and hands. On the plus side, a little goes a long way, I only need a very small amount for hand washing, not a full pump - maybe not even half a pump, so that helps take the some of the sting out of the price. Overall I'm very happy with this so far and I think my poor, irritated skin will thank me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUMQ81FNYKPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000ZHOEU#wasThisHelpful","R3HUMQ81FNYKPT","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No babies here, I bought this for myself because I was recently diagnosed with Eczema and have been searching for something gentle and non-irritating but also natural and a shampoo/body wash combo for quickie showers. I was leaning toward something entirely unscented and marketed toward adult skin conditions, but I happened upon this, did some reading on their website and it actually looked pretty good, so I ordered.I was very curious how it would smell since some reviews say ""it stinks"" or it smells like men's cologne, etc. yet others say they loved the smell. It really shows how different preferences are, because to ME, I think perfumey mainstream shampoos ""stink"". I really like the scent of this but to try and help others I'll describe it as best as I can: It's an ""earthy"" first of all. Someone mentioned patchouli and while it's not nearly as strong as that, it is along the same lines as far as smelling sort of ""woody"". In the hair it smells a little like Sandalwood for those who know that smell. I have a good nose (and use a lot of essential oils) so right off the bat I picked up both bergamot and cedarwood and sure enough, checked the label and there they are. I could absolutely understand some people thinking of it as somewhat masculine, but it definitely doesn't smell like cologne in my opinion. I'm a little bit of a hippie/earthy type so it's right up my alley but if you prefer flowery, more mainstream scents from a drugstore shampoo you may not care for it. Seems like an unusual scent for a baby product I'll admit, but I like the scent nonetheless and would use it my baby if I had one. The scent remains after my hair is dry but only very lightly. If I lift my long hair to my nose and breathe in it's there but I don't think it's strong enough for anyone else to smell unless they're hugging me or something. I'm sensitive to most scents in bath/body products and this isn't at all overwhelming for me.It worked great, a little thin for my taste but I think all baby shampoos are that way, I can't remember. It made my hair feel soft even while still wet in the shower, and it felt nice and soft after it dried. It doesn't lather a whole lot, but I don't care about lather as long as it works. People tend to be fooled into thinking lather somehow equals effectiveness and that's not true. I've only used it once, but so far it has not aggravated my eczema which was my main reason for buying it, so that's good.My only complaint, and for me it's enough to stop me from buying it again, is the price! Now this is my own fault I realize, but I bought this not fully paying attention to the fact that it's 8 ounces. I saw the size, but it didn't register in my head how small that is. Now, I know nothing about bathing babies and how long a small bottle would last so maybe it's a fine size for that, but this little bottle won't last long at all using it as both shampoo and body wash for an adult, and there's no way I'll pay that much again now that I realize how small it actually is for the price. I saw a 16 ounces size, but it's still too pricey for my budget, I'll just opt for a natural sulfate-free shampoo for grownups when this bottle is done. Too bad too, because I do love the scent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNXVEBP4SWG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003C1AFVI#wasThisHelpful","R3DNXVEBP4SWG7","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the best deal I could find by far, in stores or online. Kirkland is Costco's ""house brand"", and always seems to be good quality. I don't shop in person at Costco but have picked up various Kirkland items here on Amazon and have always been happy. Last time around was a large bottle of Acetaminophen (generic Tylenol) which was a good deal, and this time is Hydrocortisone cream. I recently developed some sort of allergic/histamine reaction to something - not sure what yet - medication, food, who knows, and I've have had an awful itchy rash all over my arms and legs for a couple weeks now. The itching is driving me insane and I've gone through the entire tube of Hydrocortisone cream that I had on hand. I'm still trying to narrow down the cause of the reaction, but in the meantime I needed more anti-itch cream immediately.This package is a quantity of FOUR 2-ounce tubes, totaling 8 ounces in all. Each one of these tubes is twice as large as the small tube I got at the drug store. Now I can keep a tube at my office desk, in my bedroom, in the bathroom, and in my purse until I figure out the cause of the reaction. The tubes have a good-sized flip-top cap which is very handy and SO much better than fumbling around in the middle of the night trying to screw back on a tiny cap with lotion covered hands when I'm already annoyed enough from the itching waking me up, so that's a big plus. The tube says ""Plus 10 moisturizers"" - not too sure about that claim; aloe is listed, but the other inactive ingredients are a bit less recognizable. Regardless, it's a great deal for 1% hydrocortisone cream and it feels and works the same as the generic tube I've always used from the drug store. I'm glad to have a larger quantity on hand and really like the easy flip-tops.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KICMSKL9EKGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZFQ318#wasThisHelpful","R3KICMSKL9EKGL","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've suffered from chronic sleep problems my entire life, and recently discovered I have DSPD (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder), so I have made several changes to attempt to improve my sleep pattern. First I bought a Light Therapy light (which I'll review separately after a little more use), and then I downloaded software that reduces the blue light glow from my computer's monitor. I also stopped sitting under a bright lamp every evening and now have a dim mini-lamp/nightlight that I turn on in the evening instead. And finally I bought these orange blue-blocking glasses. So now every morning I use the Therapy Light, and every evening I put on the glasses, and dim the both the room light and the PC monitor. I've only been doing this new routine for a few days so it's too early to speak for sure of results, although I can already report that I've fallen asleep and woken up almost exactly one hour earlier each day since I started all the above things, which in and of itself is a bit of a miracle for me. I'm still about 6 hours off a ""normal"" sleep schedule, but it's a great start.The glasses themselves are better than I expected in both quality and usability. They are true safety glasses, Z87 rated with polycarbonate lenses, although that doesn't matter much for my use. I was testing out a yellow-lensed pair of shooting goggles that I happened to already have when I first learned about this sleep/blue-light thing, but I read that orange was really ideal for blocking blue light so I ordered these. I was expecting the orange to be much darker than the yellow, but it's actually not bad at all. I find that it enhances the colors and tones of most things and I've actually come to really like how things on the screen look through them. Screen images with a lot of bright blue colors are now a rich, deep green and things look generally warmer and richer. They definitely block blue light too, my proof was that my blue modem light completely disappears when I look at it with these on, which is kind of strange but impressive. The modem light was altered but still visible through the yellow lenses, so orange is clearly better for this usage.The temple length (arms) is adjustable as well as the tilt. For example when I first put them on the bottom of the lenses were pushing into my cheeks but I realized I could adjust the angle outward a little and now they're perfect, so that's a handy feature. There is a full wrap to these, so I'm not getting any peripheral light coming in. I put these on at night mainly for my computer use but I'm quickly developing the habit of wearing them all around the house in the evenings right up until bedtime to avoid exposure to any bright lighting before bed, kitchen and bathroom lights for example. It was a little awkward at first but they've become quite agreeable and I feel good knowing I'm taking these steps toward a better night's sleep. I feel much more relaxed at night now too, wearing these combined with dimmer room lighting; it really helps me get into ""winding down mode"". I bought two pairs, one for my computer room and another for my nightstand for when I use my Kindle in bed (which I now try to avoid). Very glad I learned about these. I do wish they came with a little draw-string case however, but for the price I can't complain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R154XOIG4IXMS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000USRG90#wasThisHelpful","R154XOIG4IXMS9","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a must-have for Hull Collectors. This is my second purchase of this book, I regretfully lost my first copy in a move a few years back. This is dated 2006 on the copyright page, and as I write this review in 2014, it's the most recent edition by Brenda Roberts that I am aware of. I had her 1980 and 1992 edition of this book as well.It's a pricey book but pays for itself with the values and the info provided. There are plenty of color photos, some of them a little dated looking and not the finest clarity, but plenty clear and large enough to properly ID the pieces. This edition has the values directly next to the pottery item name, mark, and size. This is an improvement from the earlier editions which had a separate stapled insert for the values which could be misplaced. This newer edition also has color coded page edges, which makes thumbing to the section you need easier.I am slightly disappointed to see some important pieces not included in this edition which were in earlier editions, but it's a small complaint compared to the overall value of this book. While it doesn't include all the pieces ever made, it's by far the most comprehensive collection in one book on the market. I've collected Hull pottery for over 20 years and this is my go-to book for values and info. It's ordered from earliest to latest, and divided into individual lines that were made. At the beginning of each section is helpful info, such as a brief history of that line and special notations and exceptions. There's also a section showing various markings Hull used over the years, and a nice pictorial history of the company. This is a large, heavy book and makes a lovely coffee table book or a great way to show friends and family your collection without dragging out all your pieces.Joan Gray Hull also publishes a ID/Value book with several editions called ""Hull The Heavenly Pottery"". I recommend that as well, it's small and unlike this book you can easily take it along with you to shows or shops. It also fills in some of the gaps and is good for comparison of values, but this encyclopedia by Brenda Robert's can't be beat. If you have to choose only one book on Hull Pottery, this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDGOTVP06AI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=157432442X#wasThisHelpful","RCDGOTVP06AI3","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though this is petite and I don't normally wear petite sizes, I can usually get away with petite tops if that's the only choice so I ordered it anyway since others reported that the sleeves were long. I'm 5'5"" and 125 lbs and this is BIG. I ordered a size petite-medium and it looks more like a Large or even an Extra Large! I recently lost 65 pounds and this shirt would have fit me nicely before the weight loss, but at my size now it's too big. I can still wear it under things to layer, but as a stand-alone top it's too baggy. Especially under the arms, you can see it a little in the photo but it's more baggy there in person. It's also longer than I'd prefer, nearly covering my butt. I washed and dried it extra long on the hottest setting but it only shrank a little.I know monitors vary, but on my screen this looked like a Rust-ish Red but in person it's a true Christmas red. Not screaming bright, but not earthy like I expected, it's RED red. And my last complaint is the cuffs. The buttons line up on the front top of my hand!! They should be at the back side of my hand, like in the photo. It's so far off that I think it's defective. The tag included some extra thread and I can't help but to wonder if it's so I can rip the buttons off and re-sew them where they belong. The cuffs aren't prominent either, like they look in the picture, it's just the same thickness all the way down, the cuffs don't stand out like it looks in the photo.That's a lot of complaints, but there are a few good things: The material is wonderfully soft and stretchy, the shirt is extremely comfortable and the overall quality feels nice, with the exception of the misplaced buttons. The neck is comfortable also, not constricting like some turtlenecks and the edge of the collar is finished so you can fold it or wear it scrunched. I will definitely wear this shirt, but it will be under clothes in the winter as a plain old turtleneck, as opposed to a nicely fitted fashionable top as I had hoped it to be, and as it looks in the photo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEH0C247O4NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXEDJM4#wasThisHelpful","RXEH0C247O4NN","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just what I've been needing for my daily and special practices. This is the second of two volumes, both basic Tibetan Buddhist Prayers and Practices.

I have all of the prayers in these two volumes already, but they're on various PDF's, printed in notebooks or in thicker books as a part of additional content.

"I recently started seeing a new dentist who told me I should be using a fluoride rinse every day. No other dentist ever told me this in my adulthood, and I guess I never really put much thought into it, but it seemed like a good idea since I have ongoing dental issues despite my best efforts. He said to make sure it's both fluoride and antimicrobial. But when I started shopping around I couldn't believe the garbage I was seeing, most of them had blue and/or green coloring added, which I hate, and many were full of all kinds of artificial sweeteners, and hardly any were actually antimicrobial, with the exception of rinses containing alcohol, which I prefer to avoid. Finally I found this and it looked great, no crazy colors, no alcohol and is antimicrobial. Score!I did some research on the product and learned about ""Stannous Fluoride"" as opposed to ""Sodium Fluoride"", the latter of which is in most over-the-counter rinses. While there is some differences in opinions, the gist seems to be that stannous fluoride and sodium fluoride both fight cavities, but stannous fluoride has the additional benefits of improving gingivitis and reducing sensitivity. But many online articles also warn of potential teeth staining with stannous fluoride, which scared the heck out of me at first. So I emailed my dentist, told him the name of this product and my concerns, and asked if he would recommend it. He said for someone like myself with advanced gingivitis/periodontitis he would absolutely recommend my using this regularly. He also said the staining only occurs with some people, and that if it does happen, I can easily manage it by adding baking soda to my toothpaste, which as it happens I already do. So I felt much better and ordered it.The flavor is very agreeable to my taste buds, not overly 'hot' or minty, but a nice mild mint. It leaves my mouth feeling clean, although it's certainly not intended to be a mouthwash for breath. It's important to note that this is a concentrate, it comes with a little cup and you add 2 full pumps to the 1 oz cup (included) and add water and mix. I personally find the full cup a bit difficult to swish around without swallowing some but I'm getting the hang of it (you of course never want to swallow any kind of fluoride). My teeth look and feel great after use and in the short amount of time I've been using it I've seen no sign of staining. If your overall dental health is good, a product like this probably isn't necessary, but it you have ongoing decay problems and/or gum disease, this seems like a superior option. I'm looking forward to seeing the long term results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JU5II9ZVYF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5HV04I#wasThisHelpful","R37JU5II9ZVYF7","A3V5JPPCBKXJKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5JPPCBKXJKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the PERFECT knife for any bulb enthusiast.  When its time to put the bulbs in the ground - especially tulips, daffodils, and crocus' - you want something like this to make your job SUPER EASY!.  No more digging, measuring, eyeballing, guestimating, etc.  With the Hori Hori Knife you plunge it into the ground at the proper depth ( which is clearly marked on the blade ), give it a sharp twist, place your bulb in the space created, and then gently pull the knife out of the ground.  It takes less time than it takes to inhale deeply.  I plant hundreds of tulips this time of year (and garlic, etc) so this makes my job so much easier and cuts my time by about 90%.  It used to take me as long to plant bulbs as it did to prep beds for winter for the bulbs to come up in the spring.  No longer true!  With this knife, the hard work is done.Now that being said, lets talk about the construction.  This knife is tough!  Its built to be one of those tools you pass on to your kids.  It also comes with a hefty sheath so you can clip it onto your gardeners belt, and never look back.  I just love this product.  Elite Garden Tools carries some of the nicest items I've seen on the internet.  And this Hori Hori Knife does not disappoint!I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZ9PNKAPNFCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XS1OM20#wasThisHelpful","R2DZ9PNKAPNFCB","A2LKBVKUBWOVS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful corset.  I purchased it with a steampunk costume in mind and it worked fabulously.  When layered over a dark chocolate brown peasant blouse with a good bra, this corset truly showed off my curves and elongated my torso which allowed my layers of skirts to be shown off nicely.  The front hooks and the back laces up so that means unlike most of the corsets you can buy in this category, this one has a bit of flexibility so you can really snug it up or loose it out depending on its use.  It gives a fantastic amount of support for your back and ribs as well.  I added steampunk embellishments on it to dress it up, but truthfully it needed no extras.  It's made of a beautiful embroidered fabric that truly looks elegant wrapped around a ladies waist.I did order up two sizes above what I normally wear, so be aware these run small.  I'm mildly surprised wen I see people say they run true to size because I've known several friends who have ordered these as well and they also found them small.  That being said if you do get the wrong size (like one of my best friends did) then the seller is super willing to work with you to get the right one.  She had a replacement in two days and only after it arrived did she have to ship her first one back.  I think that's fantastic because after a seller has made a sale, there's nothing but good business compelling them to help fix it if folks are unhappy with something like sizing.In fact I wish Wuhu would make a wider variety of clothing.  The brand is so easy to work with that I'd feel confident ordering any sort of garment from them after how they handled my friend's corset exchange.  But enough about them.  This corset is very easy to clean too.  I just spot clean when I get spills and leave it to air dry flat.

"I love these bowls!  They are great stack-able bowls that have so many little touches of elegance and thoughtfulness about them that they'd make fantastic gifts for a baker or cook in your family.  Why?  Well first, the three sizes give you effective bowls for almost any size of project you need.  Secondly, they have little touches that really heighten their usefulness and thoughtfulness over all.  They have a COATING on the bottom that looks like silicone which keeps them from banging the counter, banging each other when stacking them, or sliding around on say slick stone counter tops.  The coating grips the counter and assists you in holding the bowl steady as you use it.  Next they have little pour spouts that are absolutely handy for sauces and any kind of liquid item you might use in them.  And finally the handles are perfect for gripping to pour the contents out.  These are super high quality professional level bowls.  Any cook or baker would love them.  I would not hesitate to grab these for part of a wedding present or even a house warming for a new home owner. :)I received this item at a discount price in return for an honest and unbiased review.

"Wow!  Awesome sound quality!  I love it when a set of headphones completely wow's me out of the box like Tzumi's Bluetooth Stereo Foldable Headphones do.  These are great!  They are a nice color and fit amazingly well over your ears.  They hug your head softly so they hold themselves up in a nice way but don't muss your hair or pinch your brain.  They charge quickly and last about six hours or a little longer before they need another charge.  I use them when I'm working on art and not only do they help me focus by tuning out all the noise around me, but by streaming wonderful music into my ears that have notes I can't get on normal headphones.  Isn't that the truth though?  When you get a really good set of headphones, like these Tzumi bluetooth Stereo ones, then you suddenly hear tones and notes in favorite songs you've never heard before and it causes you to fall in love with music all over again.They are THAT good.

"This light has so many uses!  Its designed to be a clip on light for reading books at night and it does great for that.

"This first aid kit absolutely blew me out of the water.  The bag itself that the whole kit comes in is tough enough to stand just about any indoor or outdoor adventure you take it on.  It's made of a high quality ripstop nylon that sheds dirt and is easy to clean.  Its soft sides make it easy to store and its slick surface make cleaning it a breeze.  The color red stands out so you have no problems identifying it even in the middle of a medical emergency.  Now that's JUST the packaging.  Inside, there is literally a cornucopia of help for all kinds of medical conditions.  First and foremost, there's bandaging, band-aids, and little square packs for cleaning and disinfecting wounds.  There's animal sting bites, a face shield for mouth-to-mouth, ace wraps, and then there's all kinds of pockets for you to add your own things like insect repellent and any prescription medications.There is a booklet within that reminds you of basic first aid.  It allows you to add a few things as well since it has blank pages.  There's over 80 items inside that contribute to life saving situations.  Most everything is valuable in the kit, and you get a wide assortment of all types of bandages and wraps.I would go ahead and add (there is room) super glue - which is the best way to close big wounds without sewing - and suture.  I'd also add a wide assortment of basic ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain relief and swelling.  I'd also add some feminine products that double for both emergency female needs and first aid.Otherwise this kit has it all!

"First off, there are things I love about this cream and there are things I absolutely hate about it.  I am, however, giving it four stars because it actually does what it says its going to do and really does a great job healing your skin.  I picked it up for my harsh dried chapped elbows.  They've been utterly abused due to house construction, remodel, and yardwork.  No one loves icky elbows and to boot I had dried chapped heels (from running barefoot all summer) to boot that actually matched my elbows.  I tried this cream and it worked as promised, smoothing and soothing my elbows and heels, restoring them to the perfect buttery soft condition they should be in.  That being said, there are two things about this cream I really can't stand.  I can get past them due to the healing effect, but I really want people to understand and expect this when ordering this product.First and foremost, the color.  This cream looks like the consistency of a yellowish green sludge reminiscent of finely purred pea soup.  This is not appetizing, but then again you won't have to worry about a child trying to eat it.  Secondly it smells like cannabis, which to me is sickly sweet.  People might like that smell, but I do not enjoy it.  Of all the things in this cream (and its packed full of goodness), nothing overpowers this scent and it dominates the entire cream.  To me, this is something that I don't want to go around smelling like... so I only use it after work but before I shower.So, that's my take on this cream.  It's decent, works fantastic, but the smell and appearance is hard to get around.  I did test it for staining on white fabric and so far so good, no plain white T was harmed in the testing of this product.

"My skin absolutely adores this brush!  I have lone of those long torsos so its hard for me to reach all the way behind me and really get sweat and dirt off my back.  Running a bit of liquid soap on this brush and turning it loose on my back, shoulders, neck and arms really has done the trick to clear up some back issues I was having involving breakouts.  This lovely all natural brush gently cleans and gets the job done time and time again.  I'm surprised at how well its held up in the shower - hanging there full time - being used daily and sometimes more than once a day.  The bristles are soft yet firm and really lather up the soap just as well as one of those puffs or loofas.  The added bonus is that with this brush you can reach everywhere.  I don't know why I've never owned one before now.  But I do know I'm super glad I picked Purelation's version.  This brush is built to last and super duper beautiful.  I know its something I won't hesitate to give as a gift.

Seriously a few tiny drops on any sort of toy or body part is enough to do the trick.  And that's fantastic because you get a large 4oz bottle that's easy to tuck away in a drawer somewhere.  I highly recommend Clear Joy.  It is something that everyone needs for their everyday or frequent use.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8LULACYVTW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7G3JQ8#wasThisHelpful","R3V8LULACYVTW0","A2LKBVKUBWOVS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a white Chow Chow and hes hard to keep clean.  He has very sensitive skin and he can get stinky just by roaming around outside.  I really haven't had any luck with dog shampoo until I tried Bubbas Groovy Bath Ultra Oatmeal Dog Shampoo!  My dog reacted very well to this.  First off it actually cleaned his creamy white coat and got him back to his pale glowing self.  Secondly it gave him a luxurious feel to his fur.  His barnyard stench is gone and hes super pleasant to be around again.  And one bonus to this shampoo is that although its bright pink, it doesn't stain, but really helps you as a dog owner see where the shampoo has gone.  It turns into a lovely foaming white scrub that rinses out of the coat nicely.I have a Chow Chow, a white mini poodle, and a Mutt that's mostly lab.  All three of these dogs really had a great result when I used this shampoo on them.I just really really really love the way this shampoo preformed.  Bubbas has really made a fan out of me and I think I will reorder whenever my current bottle gets low.I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LRWLTY7ZT8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I5KVSK#wasThisHelpful","R20LRWLTY7ZT8D","A2LKBVKUBWOVS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These tiny little bottles are so great!  I am using them for a Halloween party to house tiny little bits of colored sugar water with tags on them called 'Witches Brew'.  They are going to be part of a party game whereas people have to find their matching 'brew' on a person of opposite sex.  This is a great way to use them in mixers.This isn't the only use I have for these.  In fact, I loved the first batch so much I ordered a second batch because I do stained glass art.  I want to be able to solder these little bottles into some of my stained glass Halloween art to allow for a sort of 3D effect on some of the stained glass signs I make.  These bottles are light, can be made colorful (by adding liquid, colored sugar, etc) and tacked on to almost any project by a thin lead ring around their tiny necks.  I just love them so much!

"We have three vehicles at home and because of the constantly changing weather in the northwest, we have constantly changing tire pressure.  This means once a week we test the car, or one of two trucks, the trailer, the tractor, and even the horse trailer.  This Travelsafer Digital Tire Pressure Gauge is a lifesaver to my family.  Its' so simple and easy.  We don't have to worry about using the old fashioned one that doesn't read that accurately to begin with.  With this device, my husband has significantly cut down his time spent maintaining tires and airing them up.  We also go through less rubber because when you maintain correct pressure, you get the best possible wear out of your tires.  Why wear them out prematurely when you spend so much for them to begin with?  I also love the fact this gauge lets you easily read it in the dark.  You don't have to hold a flashlight, the air hose, and try to use the tire gauge as well.

"This is literally the most powerful flashlight I've ever seen and certainly the nicest one I own.  This light is blinding when you turn it on full, spotlighting a crisp clear circle that really illuminates my entire property.  I can see the back fenceline in a three acre pasture no problem with this item.  The cute little bonus flashlight that goes on your key ring is pretty neat too.  I love that this flashlight is sustainable because it comes with a rechargeable battery (that's super strong and long lasting) so you aren't wasting batteries that you have to throw away once you use them up.This flashlight is also tough.  It's built almost like one of those tactical flashlights are.  It's heavy duty and I've dropped it numerous times (even on cement) and never had an issue.I use this thing to walk between my house and my barn and I have never missed a step or tripped yet.  I just really love this flashlight and have it at the top of my Christmas list to give to family and friends who are also out in the country and need good lighting.

"I'm that girl that is always walking around with her we hair in a towel.  And wow, all my life I've been using bulky cotton towels that stay wet and don't really assist in drying.  I have a lot of hair (massive amounts) and its super long so if I don't get it dry right away, being from the pacific northwest, there's always a chance of mold.  Have you ever smelled a girl with long hair who has a slightly mildewish-moldish odor?  Odds are its her hair.  So you learn fast that if you don't want fried hair from a hair dryer (which is hellish on hair) you need to do something else.  This Microfibre Hair Towel does the trick!  It wicks water away from your head, dries your hair super fast, and is so lightweight you won't be walking around gathering a headache because of the weight on your head.I just really highly recommend this towel.

"This is a fantastic little sewing kit.  It really has it all for the emergency repair on the road.  I was recently helping a good friend with her wedding and litterally used just about every feature in this sewing kit for emergency repairs and last minute modifications.  The flower girl's hair piece kept slipping so I went ahead and sewed it to her braid.  We fixed a tiny tear in the train which happened getting out of the limo after the wedding but before the reception.  I also used it on myself to tack up a hemline that came loose on some poorly stitched maid of honor dress.  I'm just super impressed at this kit and am really thankful I had it with me for my really good friend's most important day.  It literally has all the colors of thread you might need, super sharp scissors, needles, and everything in between (pins, needle threaders, measuring tape, etc) so it will really save the day.I received this kit at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39W33A53GMWOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZXODW6#wasThisHelpful","R39W33A53GMWOY","A2LKBVKUBWOVS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LKBVKUBWOVS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I switched from cow’s milk to almond milk quite some time ago, but found that it can be expensive to buy, so I went looking for a more cost effective and all natural method.  That’s when I came across this great hemp bag!  I made my first batch of almond milk in it almost a year ago and the bag is holding up strong, so I can attest to its longevity for sure!  I just purchased my second one recently so I could have a backup for doing other things.I love that this bag does not become misshapen, get twisted or deformed in anyway like some other nut milk bags I’ve tried in the past!  I use it almost every day and the seams and drawstring remain strong, intact and sturdy! It also catches all the pulp so I have perfect smooth milk when I'm finished.I will never drink store bought almond milk again!  I love this product! It’s well made, sturdy, all natural and even anti-microbial and resistant to mold which is very important to me as my son is highly allergic to mold! I am in love with hemp products anyway, and so this fit right into my lifestyle.  I am now testing the waters with making rice and coconut milk as well as homemade cheeses. I’m finding this bag comes in handy for all of these.  Great product, highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DUDQICLHBL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2B1YGI#wasThisHelpful","R13DUDQICLHBL1","A2WZ8F08L03U3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZ8F08L03U3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wasn’t feeling well and spent several days in bed just trying to rest, but boredom set in and I looked for a good read and I got just what I was looking for in Hunt for the Star!  This very well written book was full of everything I look for in a fantasy novel.  Well-developed characters that I felt emotionally involved with and loved getting to know on a personal level.  A story-line that the author did a fabulous job with.  My heart was pounding and I devoured the book in two days, I simply didn’t want to put it down!

"My entire life I have suffered with sleep issues.  Mouth breathing caused me to snore quite loudly, I woke with sore throats daily and never feel rested when I wake up.  Lately it's been getting so bad that the snoring is affecting my husband's sleep so when I received an offer to try this product for free in exchange for an honest review I jumped at the chance!  Until receiving these nasal vents I never realized how much my snoring was truly affecting my life.  This review could not be more heartfelt!  This product has changed my life!!  The first night I selected the size that fit my nose snug and comfortably, there are four sizes to choose from and found them to be absolutely amazing!  I am a side sleeper and never had a problem with them coming out at all as a few other reviewers stated.  They stay in all night and do exactly as they promised!  For the very first time in my life I am waking up well rested rather than feeling like I didn't sleep at all.  I used to have to nap several times a day to play catch up on the sleep I missed at night due to snoring but now I have energy like never before because I'm actually getting rest at night!  I love this product so much I'm buying another set just to have a back up because I never want to be with out them again.I am starting to believe I have Sleep Apnea but was never properly diagnosed.

"I've been really getting into inspirational things to brighten my mood lately so when I came across these cards browsing for inspirational words I didn't hesitate to buy them.  I keep them on my nightstand and started flipping a card daily to lift my spirits.

"I'm kind of up in the air on whether or not I'd recommend these spoons.  I thought they were going to be longer, more like an iced tea spoon since that is what I searched for and these came up, but I guess that could be my fault for not reading the actual length in the description.  That being said, though they are really cute, I find I can't really find a good use for them and they just sit in the drawer.  They aren't long enough to be used for my tea, and the spoon itself is a bit too shallow to hold soup or even ice cream. I must admit I enjoy seeing those hearts in my drawer though! :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27253TTEFRAA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055B07L6#wasThisHelpful","R27253TTEFRAA3","A2WZ8F08L03U3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZ8F08L03U3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I work from home and live in a duplex, so keeping my two dogs quiet is a must for me.  They’d been barking quite a bit during the day at neighbors and other noises they’d hear, so I got this collar and tried it on each of them.  The collar worked very well at keeping their noise down and seemed to sort of train them NOT to bark anymore because they don’t want to get beeped and then shocked they just remain quiet now even on days when I forget to use the collar.  I love it and am very happy with the purchase.

"I really like this product!  I am sensitive to strong perfume scented things and also have sensitive skin that can be easily irritated by trying new products, but this product has not caused me any irritation in either aspect.  My skin instantly soaks up the serum and feels silky and smooth for hours after application.  I love that there is no greasy feeling before, during or after application.  I love the color of the bottle, it's beautiful with a nice glass dropper to help you apply a small amount as needed!  I use it in the morning under my make up and apply more of an amount at bedtime. I love that the storage period is 3 years so you know it will last a long time.  I especially LOVE the fact that they do NOT test on animals and that is very important to me as an animal lover!

"Absolutely deserving of the 5 star rating!  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review and this review cannot get more honest.  I am going through a very difficult time in my life, a separation and I'm sure eventual divorce from my husband of almost 21 years!  I hate sleeping in the dark and don't like to sleep alone.  As soon as I received this product I immediately looked up essential oils and which ones were best for relaxation.  I ordered some Chamomile (found here: http://amzn.to/1EVyW6X) and Bergamot oils (found here: http://amzn.to/1EVyGEX) and love them both with this!  I choose the setting where the lights gradually change colors and the mister goes on and off for giving it a break every few minutes. I lay in bed, watching the colors change and taking in the aroma while listening to a meditation video online and before I know I am passed out and sleep like a baby.  Waking periodically in the night to use the restroom and finding my room full of soft ambient light and comforting colors and immediately fall back to sleep after coming back to bed.  It also relaxes my two dogs like crazy!  This is the best little item I could have received and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OD5N31H3577Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF6YTNM#wasThisHelpful","R1OD5N31H3577Z","A2WZ8F08L03U3M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WZ8F08L03U3M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also love how clear the case is so it doesn't hide the beauty of the phone itself, one of the reasons I bought the phone after all, why would I want to hide it with a colored case?

"I have a friend that has a 3d printer. After seeing some of the things his son created my husband wanted to try his hand. Since I didn’t want to shell out several hundred dollars for our first go around, I found a great deal on this Sunwing 3d Stereoscopic Drawing Doodling Printing Pen and had to pick it up! There is a learning curve but he has had a great time trying and working on his “skill” level; if one can call it that. ;) This 3d pen uses the same size filament that my friend’s 3d printer uses so we can share filament! He has taken some 3d printed designs and used this pen to add touches and embellishments as well as creating some little knick-knacks for our kids. It took some time to get used to drawing in the air, but once you experiment and get used to the heat and speed controls he has drawn some cool stuff. No Eiffel Tower yet, but he will get there.This is a great 3d pen for a beginner and you can’t beat the price. I would definitely purchase from this seller again!Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.

"If you are looking for the perfect gift to welcome baby, look no further! I picked up this item for my sister who is pregnant with my nephew and she was thrilled to receive it. As a mom, I understand the importance behind using materials that are best for baby (hypoallergenic and antibacterial) and the softer the items that touch little one’s skin, the better.Like mother, like daughter, my little one has very sensitive skin. Early on we became well aware of the need for quality products that not only do a job but keep our little one happy; bamboo does just this. For us, soft clothes, towels, washcloths; they are all a must.I admit that I was a bit nervous about getting this gift set because some bamboo towels that I have picked up in the past have been rough and I have found that they don’t soften a great deal even after being washed. From the moment I opened the Bamboo Moon Gift Set box and slid my fingers over the material I just knew this product would be different.The product colors are bright and true and just by looking at the items I was able to tell they are quality; feeling them only confirmed my thoughts. The material is absolutely amazing and soft. I wanted to take them with me for my bath time but alas, they are a bit small for this mamma. The Bamboo Moon Gift Set comes with a Towel (30” x 30”), two washcloths (10” x 10”), and a bib.This is the perfect baby shower gift and one that I was pleased to share with my sister. I can’t wait until my nephew arrives and I have the opportunity to wrap him up in soft, fluffy blue towel after bath time. I’m ready to create new precious memories!If you are in the market for the perfect Baby Shower Gift, click the BUY button now!Disclaimer: I received complimentary product to facilitate this review.

"As someone who works on my laptop full-time, if not longer, I am always on the lookout for products that will make my life easier, are quality, and will stand up the daily “beating” that I dish out while working.My computer is an established point but accessories, such as my mouse, are up to me to optimize and thanks to my Acctrend Wireless Mouse, I’ve been able to do just that. Probably my favorite thing about this mouse is this length. Anytime I go to the store, I constantly find what I like to refer to as “mini mouse” which is great for travel but not that great for daily use at home. The problem with a smaller mouse is by the end of the day, I am barely able to move my hand; especially my fingers. The length of my Acctrend means I am able to work steady for over eight hours, get up, and go about my business with the use of my hand and fingers intact.I’ve been a huge fan of wireless mouse since they hit the market so for me, this is the only way to go. I work at home and on different surfaces every day. Be it from my desk, the kitchen table, couch, or bed I need something that will work with my schedule and location and a wireless mouse; especially one that works on any surface (like my Acctrend) is a must.The life expectancy of my new mouse is 8,000,000 clicks and I plan to put it to the test. I have no idea how many clicks I make a day but it is A LOT. I’ve gone through three mouse in the nearly 2 years I have been working at home and I am hoping my new Acctrend outlasts the others. Needless to say, I am in love and hope this little guy sticks with me through the years!Three things. First, the mouse takes 2 AAA which are not included. That is a bit of a bummer if you don’t keep batteries on hand but we do so not a problem. Second, the mouse does not come with instructions. If you are not familiar with the normal setup of a mouse, it may take you a few minutes to get better acquainted. Third, I am NOT a gamer so I have no idea how the mouse would hold up for such purposes. I am speaking as a daily user that types only.Overall, a great mouse at a great price with a great look!Disclosure: I received complimentary product in exchange for my unbiased review.

"I picked up this product kind of as a joke, or at least to create a giggle, going into the holiday season. Our family is constantly poking fun at each other about the number of selfies that everyone takes so I thought this would be a fun addition to this year’s festivitiesAs soon as the Slimtech Selfie Stick arrived I checked the box for directions, and upon not finding any I called my 5 year old in for assistance. Needless to say, within moments we had everything unpackaged, set up, we played with the nobs and buttons, and we were ready to go. That is how easy this is to use!With as lightweight as the selfie stick is I was surprised with how durable it is. My daughter started playing with it, twisting it, and even bounced it on the floor a few times and it held up like a champ. I am also impressed with the ease of use. My daughter is and was able to work everything on the selfie stick without any form of guidance.There is a removable Bluetooth shutter that is clipped to the pole of the selfie stick. You are able to remove the remote to take pictures further away but we are trying to keep it attached so our little one doesn’t lose it.I also love that the handle is soft and padded because it makes it easier and more pleasant to hold while taking pictures. The pole of the selfie stick extends to make it easier to take pictures further away or to include more people in the picture and then it slides down into a more compact version for close ups and easy carrying. I also like that the head of the selfie stick swivels which allows us to change the angle of the picture as needed.I was really concerned about how my phone was going to fit since I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 in an Otterbox but I was able to slide the holder open, slip my phone inside, and we were good to go in moments. This selfie stick will hold a variety of phones of varying sizes so it truly is a gem that accommodates everyone’s needs.Now that we have been using our selfie stick for a few days I have come to understand why people love them so much. This is going to be a great addition to our holiday season and I am thrilled that we have it!Disclosure: I received complimentary product in exchange for my unbiased review.

"My daughter has been into everything coloring since she was old enough to hold a crayon. Now that she is in Kindergarten and learning how to write new words every day she is into coloring AND writing and she wants to do it all in brilliant colors. I can’t say I blame her; her mamma is the same way. ;)The no brainer, go to when it comes to coloring and writing is often gel pens; unfortunately, not all gel pens are created equal. Actually, the majority of the gel pens that I have purchased have been downright disappointing but after seeing this set of Super Doodle Gel Pens and reading the reviews, I figured I would give them a whirl … I mean, umm, my daughter would.They have been AMAZING! The colors are vibrant, they flow is great, and the ink is actually full. My little one has been using these pens to write and color for days and they are still perfect. As a mamma, I really like the package that they come in because each pen is set up in its own “holding chamber” which makes it easier for me to identify if one is missing. Yeah, she is 5 and by the time she is done playing, normally one or two need to be relocated. The package is also great for in the car traveling because it is easy for her to open and close between each use.Overall, this is a great set of pens and one that I would recommend to any child, adult, or child at heart that is looking for a pack of vibrant gel pens that actually work. I am considering picking up a couple of more packs as stocking stuffers since I have a niece and nephew that are into everything color as well.

"I’ve gone through my fair share of earbuds. My biggest problem has always been horrible sound quality and the cords themselves. The standard ear bud cords break and wear out with regularity. This is not a problem with the ACCTREND Earbuds. The Kevlar cord is super strong and the sound quality is outstanding. I don’t have to worry about the cord breaking when they inevitably get caught on something and yanked out of my ear.Another thing that sets the ACCTREND Earbuds apart from their competitors is the overall package. The packing is unique as each little piece and part has its own compartment. There is an ear hook that helps hold the earbuds in place when I am speed walking and there are 3 extra pairs of ear pieces that are different sizes. Everything comes in a cute little package so they are perfect for a purse, backpack, briefcase, and more.I have been using my new ACCTREND Earbuds/Earphones for about a week and they are great so far.

"My little girl’s birthday is coming up and I am so excited to have this product that I can’t even describe it in words. Needless to say, we will be using it to make fun finger foods for her birthday party; foods that are the perfect size for little fingers. Then the holidays … the possibilities are endless and I plan to explore as many of them as possible before the clock hits midnight on New Year’s Eve!The DIY Cutter from OliaDesign is perfect for fondant, cake, cookies, breads, lunch meat, cheese, and so much more. It is a great tool to use when you invite your little one(s) in for time in the kitchen. On the flip side, it is even fun to use during pretend play when we are working with playdough, slime (yes, my daughter loves slime), and other fun products around the house.The cutter, made from a sturdy plastic, contains 24 cutouts and houses 12 different shapes, two of each. Some of the shapes included are fruits, stars, hearts, flowers, circles, and moons. Cleanup is easy courtesy of warm soapy water.Overall, I love this product but only for specific use. For baking days in the kitchen with my little one this will be fun because we will be able to make a variety of shapes in a timely manner. For none themed parties or events; the shapes included are perfect. However, if I only wanted to bake heart shape or star cookies that would be rather impossible. Add a holiday to the mix and a single cookie cutter would likely be a better route.The only negative about this cutter is how flat the cookies are that it produces. We prefer larger, fluffier cookies and this product does not lend itself to creating such. That being said, I think it will be perfect for a little girl’s birthday and can’t wait to break it out in a couple of weeks just for that!Still, all and all … a great product and one that I am certain we will put to great use and rather often.Disclaimer: I received a promotional or discounted product in exchange for my review.

"I am so excited that we received a citrus juicer right before a busy holiday season full of cooking and baking!During the holidays we pull out all the stops and cook and bake things that we only make once a year … during the holidays. In the past I have tried squeezing juice out of lemons, limes, and oranges using my hands and a plastic squeezer but both are a pain. When I use my hands I know that there is juice left behind that I simply can’t get; often times I even have my husband come in to give a few extra squeezes. Even worse, I often have to spend time pulling the seeds out that slip into the juice. With the plastic juicer … I’ve broken two; need I say more?I love that this stainless steel juicer is so strong and durable. You simply cut the fruit in half, slide it into the juicer (fruit side up), and squeeze your little heart out. You’ll be surprised at the amount of juice that is produced! The holes in the OliaDesign Stainless Steel Squeezer/Juicer that we received are larger than those I’ve found in its competitors but they are still small enough that the seeds don’t slip through. This awesome little kitchen tool/toy makes it easy to add a splash of juice to brighten the flavor of a meal or take an exact measurement for baking. It’s a win, win situation.Avoid the draw of the plastic bottle and stick with fresh flavors! Pick up a bag of lemons or limes and let the flavors flow. Fresh is best and this tool just makes having it that much easier!The OliaDesign Stainless Steel Squeezer is the perfect stocking stuffer for the cook or baker in your family or simply a great addition to the family kitchen. This is a great product at a reasonable price.Disclaimer: I received a promotional or discounted product in exchange for my review.

"We hate the taste of the water from our tap, so any drinking water comes out of the fridge. Needless to say we can go through more than the average number of water filters and this can be rather costly. Fortunately, we no longer have to pay an arm and a leg purchasing the original filters thanks to the Samsung compatible Replacement Refrigerator Water Filter from EternaWaterTM.This water filter fits perfectly in our refrigerator, does not leak, and the water tastes just as good. A filter that works just as good at a fraction of the cost; hmmm paying less than $25 versus $50+ … yes please! Just twist and pull the old one out, put in the new one, and twist it into place. It’s that easy.I will note that the replacement filter is a bit shorter than the original filters we normally pick up.

Seriously, classic Pac-Man, I could buy a half dozen of these and that still wouldn’t be enough for the guys in our life.The mug arrived in a white box which makes it easy for wrapping and gifting. From our few days use, I can tell that the mug and handle are durable and will stand the test of time as we continue to revive Pac-Man and the gain every morning. There aren’t any directions that I am able to find so I don’t know if the cup is dishwasher or microwave safe so I will be avoiding both and I will stick with handwashing this item just to increase the life span of the product.Overall, this is the perfect mug and one that the entire family enjoys. If you are anyone that you know loves Pac-Man, I recommend snagging a few for the upcoming holiday season. Too cute for words!Please note that I would generally give a 4 star review for not receiving the product that I anticipated receiving but we love our Pac-Man mug and I just can’t bring myself to do it!Disclaimer: I received a promotional or discounted product in exchange for my review. Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9PZL40U198K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S7T0AG#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9PZL40U198K","A12705DE0JYIMN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12705DE0JYIMN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is a big fan of Japanese food and always partakes in a cup or three (okay, maybe more) of Sake every time we go out for a nice meal at a local Japanese restaurant. He also loves theme dinners so when I saw this Sake Set from OliaDesign I knew that it would be the perfect addition to our family!I did not receive the set pictured but I did receive a beautiful set that is red, black, and orange and appears to be hand painted. This set consists of a sake server and 4 cups and comes in a gift box with a clear cover to display how beautiful the product is. The ceramic is strong but the pieces still feel delicate so they will be treated as such in our home. That being said, according to the seller, the set is dishwasher and microwave safe. I think we will stick with hand washing.This beautiful Japanese Sake Set would be the perfect gift for a bride and groom that like to enjoy intimate date nights at home, a married couple that enjoys date nights at home, or anyone that likes to throw small parties where they entertain a small number of guests. I can easily see this piece being placed on displayed in a curio cabinet as well.Overall, a beautiful product and a great price! I would recommend this to anyone looking to add a touch of Sake to their life.Please note, I am giving a 4 star review because the item provided was not as described and I know that would not set well with many.Disclaimer: I received a promotional or discounted product in exchange for my review.

"Everyone has traditions and when I think of our family traditions, the first thing that comes to mind is Thanksgiving. The festivities start on the eve of Thanksgiving when we all gather at mom’s house to start cooking up a storm. We divvy up the work (food prep), have snacks and drinks, and indulge in good conversation. Overall, a good time is had by all!This year, I plan to up the laughs courtesy of my Thanksgiving Day Roasted Turkey Hat from OliaDesign. With a soft, fluffy outside and textured inside this hat is perfect for all day cooking starting on Thanksgiving morning. The sizing says one size fits most and that statement is completely accurate as my daughter, husband, and I have been running around the house with it on the past few days; it is fair to say my husband’s head is a wee bit larger than my daughter’s and even mine!The hat that I received has tight stitching with zero loose threads. It’s stands upright proud of its representation and the colors are true to those pictures in the ad. Per the company, the hat is machine washable; however, I have not yet had a reason to wash it. I imagine after being passed through the family on Thanksgiving, it will need to be cleaned up a bit.This Thanksgiving Day hat is cute and could easily dub as a table centerpiece or even a fun decorative item. Overall, it is a barrel of giggles and I can’t wait to surprise my family with it on Thanksgiving Eve!Disclaimer: I received a promotional or discounted product in exchange for my review.

"I absolutely love the pop of color that our new 4-piece stackable mugs add to our kitchen. This cheerful foursome comes in red, yellow, blue, and green with a crisp white inside. Each cup measures 2.9 inches in diameter and 2.64 inches in height.The set is accompanied by a rack which allows you to nest the cups inside each other. This allows us to store the cups on our counter for quick use without taking up a lot of space; which is perfect for someone that does not have a great deal of counter space to spare.As an avid coffee drinker I can’t say that our new OliaDesign cups are large enough to quench my thirst but they are perfect for a cup of tea on a rainy day or a cup of cocoa while preparing for family movie night My daughter thinks they will be perfect for the Tea Party that she plans to hold this weekend; now that we have the cups. ;)Overall, this is a cute set that will add a splash of color to any kitchen and they will have you smiling as you indulge in a favorite drink.

"I have been reinventing my love for cooking by trying to introduce new flavor profiles into our home. While this is easy and exciting on a multitude of levels; it can quickly become more difficult (at least for me) when I try to integrate ethnic foods that I am not familiar cooking.  I am decent when it comes to Italian food and I have a few Chinese recipes in my repertoire but my husband loves Mexican food so I need to up my game.Of course I am capable of cooking our rather “Americanized” version of things like tacos, a few sauces, and a few dips but when it comes to true Mexican cooking I admit that I need a hand and think I may have found the right one courtesy of this Mexican Slow Cooker Cookbook.Now, generally I prefer hardcover cookbooks because … well … that is what I grew up with BUT I was able to get this cookbook in the Kindle format. The first thing that I noticed that is different about this cookbook versus others in my collection is that it provides history on Mexican cooking. It gives information on foods, origins, uses, and provides a list of ingredients that are common in Mexican cuisine. I love this because it allows me to grocery shop early and have essentials on hand when I want to play around with a recipe to make it my own. After providing a wealth of knowledge, the book moves into the good stuff … RECIPES!First, the pictures are absolutely beautiful. We’re talking lick the page pretty and they make you want to eat the food. As someone who searches out recipes on the Internet almost daily, I can honestly say there are recipes that I have passed because the pictures don’t make the food look good. We eat with our eyes first and this cookbook definitely kept that in mind!As far as the recipes are concerned, I love that they offer something for everyone. Of course there are main dishes but they also provide recipes for soups, dips, and desserts. Um yeah, you have to check out the dessert section! Seriously, I can’t say enough about the recipes. Once you see the pictures you will completely understand.The other thing that I really like about this book is that it has a section that talks about the dos and don’ts when it comes to slow cooker cooking and how to handle your slow cooker. I am sad to say that I am breaking one of the rules as I type this. Last night I was tired and I put my slow cooker in the fridge knowing that I would change it out this morning … I didn’t. You aren’t supposed to store food in a slow cooker so that means I need to pitch the leftovers from last night. I seriously feel as though I learn something new every day when it comes to cooking!I know that I am rambling but this book has opened up a whole new world to me and not just in the realm of Mexican cooking. I now better understand how to handle my slow cooker too! This is a great read and one that I encourage you to add to your collection as well!Disclaimer: I received complimentary product to facilitate this review.

"I love to cook and I love to experiment with flavor profiles but when it comes to herbs and spices I get a little nervous. Why? Because seasoning foods is the easiest way to enhance a recipe or destroy it entirely. I’m often either too heavy handed when added spice/herbs or I don’t add enough and the food ends up tasting bland. Thanks to the Essential Spices and Herbs book, I am hoping this will no longer be a problem … at least after a short period of trial and error.What I love about this book is that it features 50 herbs and spices that the author finds essential for cooking. The author starts by explaining the difference between an herb and a spice and then she provides background information on each herb and spice and how they can be used to improve our lives and recipes. For me, this educational portion of the book was extremely helpful because it gives me a better feel for the flavor profile and what to expect from each addition.The book also contains recipes that are pictured beautifully and give a rustic feel. Then again when I think of herbs and spices I think rustic so I guess the two go hand in hand; at least for me!We have been working on cooking at home more often and whenever possible, cooking from scratch. My hope is that as we venture through the fall months and holiday season that we will put this book to good use and better understand a multitude of herbs and spices by the new year. I’m excited to share this book with my sister who went to culinary school and my husband can’t wait to try a few of the recipes listed, after visiting a local whole food grocer, this weekend! This is a great addition to our kitchen and is perfect for cooks that deem themselves beginners or advanced.Disclaimer: I received complimentary product to facilitate this review.

"I love cooking and do it as often as possible; however, how I cook varies based on the day. Like everyone, we have a very busy, on-the-go lifestyle during the week so I like simple. During the weekend I like to roll up my sleeves, break out all the pots and pans, and go to town. To please both needs, I have started preparing our weekly meals during the weekend, placing the ingredients in a container, and then keeping it simple during the week. My favorite is one pot meals or more specifically, crock pot meals. Using a crock pot allows me toss everything in one pot first thing in the morning, then I give it a mix, and head off for my day. Upon our return in the evening, dinner is either ready or just about ready and then we have time to relax as a family.The problem is I only own one crock pot so that limits me a bit … at least until now. We recently became the proud owners of a Crock-Pot Cook & Carry 6-Quart Manual Slow Cooker and we love it!After giving it a quick wash in warm soapy water yesterday morning, I added my ingredients to make a pot roast, gave it a couple of stirs, and then headed off for a day of work. By the time we arrived home we had time to change our clothes, get our little one a bath, run a load of laundry, and then sit down to eat. It was perfect!What I love about this crock pot is that it is larger than the one that I have owned for nearly 10 years. Now I am able to prepare larger meals, which is extremely helpful for nights when I have my mom over for dinner or my sister and brother, and I don’t feel like have to settle on smaller portion sizes. I also love the simplicity of this slow cooker. It doesn’t have fancy bells and whistles but I am okay with that. This Crock-Pot has four settings: Off, Low, High, and Warm. I turned my Crock-Pot on high, left for the day, and the meat was fork tender by the time we were ready to eat. In addition, I love that this crock pot comes with a lid-mounted locking system which will allow me to cook at home and then take the pot with me during the upcoming holiday months when we all bring something for the table.I didn’t put my hand on the outside of the pot to see how hot it was but I could feel the heat coming off of it as I was dishing out dinner. Seriously, I don’t recommend putting your hand on a stainless steel surface that is heated; you are just asking for problems. My 6-quart pot has the ability to serve at least 7 people, the interior pot is made of stoneware, and as an added bonus … it is dishwasher safe! I admit that I always wash my crock pot by hand and will likely continue to do so. Cleanup was easy and the pot looks like new after being washed.I haven’t found anything that I dislike about my Crock-Pot to date but we have only used it twice in the past week since we received it. If something changes, I will update my review.This is a must have item for any household!Disclaimer: I received complimentary product in exchange for an unbiased review.

"I am new to the essential oil scene but I have been doing research here and there, when time permits, to determine which oils I should add to my small but powerful collection. After researching and researching and researching a little more, I knew that Tea Tree Oil is a must have.After reading article after article, I am yet to find another essential oil that is as versatile as Tea Tree Oil is. It works to fight foot odor, removes makeup, and aids in the battle against sunburn, chicken pox, psoriasis, earaches, rashes, insect bites, and much, much more. And did I mention that I can use this oil as a part of my household cleaning regimen as well?This week I have used my Tea Tree Oil as an insect repellant at my daughter’s soccer practice, to alleviate a few spots of acne, and mixed it with water, vinegar, and lemon essential oil to clean my counter tops. Versatile? Yes! And this stuff really works!I don’t want anyone in my family to suffer with illness but as the colder months are quickly approaching, and a new school year is about to begin, I will sit back and wait for some of the unpleasant visitors that will be driven to become better acquainted with those in my home. I’ll be ready with blanket in one hand and Tea Tree Oil in the other. Armed with a new, reliable friend, I am ready to fight a good fight!I can’t wait to learn more about Tea Tree Oils and daily uses for this amazing product. I am lucky to have received a 4 fl. oz. bottle with an accompanying glass dropper as only a few drops are needed for each use. This bad boy is going to last me well into the winter, if not longer. The scent is strong but pleasant and at times I even find myself opening the bottle just for a quick whiff of the goodness inside! No, that doesn’t make me strange … just happy with my oils.This is a great product and one that I urge you to add to your collection if you are into essential oils or ready to become better acquainted with them.

"As the unfortunate owner of very thick nails, both fingernails and toenails, I am always on the lookout for quality clippers that will get the job done without breaking or destroying my nails. This sounds like a really simple request, right? Clippers that clip nails; yeah, not so much! After seeing a 4.9 out of 5 stars rating and positive review after positive review, I decided to try the Premium Nail Clippers Set from Grooming District.The set includes a nail clipper, toenail clipper, emery board, and a case for easy storage and travel. The first thing that I noticed about the clippers is that they are quality. Hand-crafted and made from non-corrosive tempered Stainless Steel, both sets have sharp blades that cut through even the strong of nails with ease. Each set has a built-in nail file and the matte finish supports an easy, non-slip grip.Although this set is a bit more expensive than I am used to spending on clippers, they are well worth the cost. Anyone that has gone toe to toe with a flimsy pair of clippers knows that they come out with chipped nails, uneven nails, split nails, and sometimes uncut nails. If the blades are sharp, you simply clip away until there is nothing left. I’ve even cut myself in the process of trying to get clippers to cut through my thick nails.I love that I am able to use my Grooming District Premium Clippers on my nails, my toddler’s nails, and my husband is able to use them as well. There is definitely something to be said about quality. In my world, it lends itself to loyalty.I recommend the Groom District Premium Nail Clippers Set to anyone looking for a quality product with precision cutting. If the need arrives, I will purchase from this company again.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

"I have a love/hate relationship with sleep. I love to sleep but it has been difficult to find a pillow that is comfortable and holds its shape. This results in tossing and turning at night, punching my pillow, fluffing my pillow, and sometimes throwing it off the bed and sleeping on my arm.Over the years I have tried a variety of pillows made from different materials but I always end up back with my old trusty big and fluffy. Unfortunately, not all pillows are created equal a.k.a. they flatten in a matter of days and bye, bye Mr. Fluffy Pillow. I’ve been on the hunt for new pillows for a few weeks. I have been eyeballing the pillows from Exceptional Sheets but having a difficult time justifying the price. My husband put it this way … we have always had good luck with Exceptional Sheets and their products AND if these pillows hold up longer than others then we won’t be spending more money in the end because we will be repurchasing less frequently. Makes sense … click … purchase!Our new King Size Pillows arrived quickly and, as always, with a personalized note thanking us for our business. I opened the box and had them on our bed within a matter of minutes. Perfect size for our king size bed with a little extra pillow to spare; WIN! That night I could barely wait to go to bed and see if they held up to the ES standard that I have set over the years. I didn’t toss and turn and I didn’t spend half the night trying to fluff the pillow. In fact, I don’t remember waking up at all. SCORE!We are about a week in and the pillows are still holding their shape perfectly. Do I expect them to “flatten” in the future? YES! I move around a lot at night and that means I abuse my pillows. That isn’t a big deal though because I am big on keeping things clean and plan on washing and drying my pillows; this will clean them and re-up the fluff factor!Overall, I am extremely pleased with our new pillows and now I go to bed ready to rest, not fluff. Once again, a great transaction with ES!Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

"I am new to the essential oils scene but after a few issues, I fell in love. A friend suggested that I purchase a diffuser to keep my home “oily” so I picked up a cheap unit, gave it a whirl, and received compliment after compliment about how amazing our home smells. Thanks to the oils that we use, it also helps keep this busy momma calm; which is definitely an added bonus!Now, while I love the first diffuser I purchased, I’m not IN love with it. It was cheap and works well but it is also small, plastic, and not aesthetically pleasing. Since I have been housing it in my family room, I have been looking for something more striking and found it!Enter the ZAQ Paradise Glass Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser.Our new diffuser is beautiful and I have no problem with it being on display in the most commonly visited room in our house. I admit that I was shocked with how large it is, about the size of a small-medium sized pumpkin, but still love the unit. I especially love the color changing LED lighting. At night, I like to turn off all of the lights, snuggle up on the couch, and watch the diffuser; it’s definitely relaxing. There is a “favorite color” and no light mode as well but I like watching the shift. I also like that there is a large water chamber on this diffuser which allows it to run for a longer period of time. I can fill up the diffuser before I start dinner and it turns off right before bedtime, about 5 to 6 hours later. This diffuser is perfect for our family and everyday use!If there is one thing about the diffuser that I’m not a huge fan of it is the amount of oil that I have to use in order to “scent” our home. That being said, the water reservoir/chamber is rather large so it makes sense. I am adding 15 to 20 drops of EOs every time I run this diffuser and sometimes that isn’t even enough. It just seems like a large amount to me. Perhaps I am doing something wrong or using the wrong oil? Like I said, I am new to oils and definitely have more research to do!Overall, we love our ZAQ Diffuser and are thrilled to have added it to our small but promising collection.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.

"My sister has been all a tizzy about eating healthier since she found out she is pregnant. She decided that since I TRY to eat a healthier diet that this would be a great way for us to bond since I am attempting to re-up my efforts. Her husband brought home quinoa a couple of weeks ago and this “superfood” is all that I have been hearing about ever since. I admit that I have been avoiding the topic since I know nothing about quinoa but when your brother-in-law drops some off at the house and tells you to get cooking, that means it is time to learn. The best way to do that is with someone else’s recipes … at least to start.What I love about this cookbook is not only does it provide me with 150 Gluten-Free (a must have for me) recipes, it also gives me background on quinoa, the health benefits, and a ton of information on why I NEED this superfood in my daily life.More importantly, this cookbook shows me the diversity within this specific product. From breakfast foods to dinner, smoothies, and even desserts, quinoa can become a part of every meal offering a different taste and texture while providing the same benefits. Did I mention there is a slow cooker recipe? I love this because it allows me to get my side dish ready early in the afternoon while I debate what our main course is going to be. This doesn’t leave me grabbing for less healthier options when I am rushing to finalize dinner and get the meal on the table. Hmm, did I mention desserts too?I love the tips attached to a number of the recipes, the “resources” section which provides additional outlets to obtain more recipes, and the conversion tables and glossary; which this new quinoa-ian (I totally just made that up) found very useful.This cookbook is a great resource and I’m thrilled to have added quinoa to our meal planning!Disclaimer: I received this book for free in exchange for an unbiased review.

"Per my doctor’s request, I try to follow a low-carb, high protein lifestyle. The problem with this is there is only so much “meat and cheese” that an individual can handle before they start craving carbs; at least, that is what happens to me. Thankfully, Jennifer Koslo’s cookbook covers the cravings and much, much more in a carb friendly way!“Low-Carb Cravings Cookbook: Your Favorite Foods Made Low-Carb” covers just about everyone. Specifically: breakfast, sides, snacks, soups (stews and chilies), sandwiches and wraps, pizzas and pastas (yes, you read that right), desserts and more. In other words, she has created recipes that will not only keep the entire family fed but also healthier and perhaps even happier. We’re talking Cheese Sticks with Marinara, Bacon Cheeseburgers, Chili Dogs, Fettuccine Alfredo, Peanut Butter Cups, and even Ice Cream! Are you drooling? Yeah, I understand!What I love about this cookbook is Koslo introduces well-known foods, foods that we all love to indulge in, in a healthier way. I love that the recipes are family friendly so I don’t feel like I will have to beg my 5-year-old to eat “diet” food and I don’t have to stare my husband down and tell him to “enjoy” a tasteless plate in an effort to create a good example. These are awesome recipes for things that we already love to eat.Koslo’s cookbook also takes a more realistic approach which I love. She clearly states that the best way to satisfy a craving is to give in a little. She notes that it is all about moderation and choices. This is the right way to look at things. We can still enjoy things, just in moderation. As someone that has problems with gluten, I also like that the book offers gluten-free, vegetarian, and dairy-free options. In other words, this cookbook has something for everyone and that is a must have in my world.If there is one negative, I would say the book is a bit longer/wordier than it needs to be. You are likely thinking the same about me right now! If you are looking for a straightforward cookbook then this may not be the cookbook for you. Koslo includes “educational” portions in the book before ever reaching the recipe section. I really liked this but can see how others may not. Personally, I like that she gives tips, breaks down ingredients, discusses spices, and gives me more to think about in the realm of food and choices! Again, this is just me and may not be for everyone.Overall, if you are interested in following a low-carb diet and would like to get your family, including pickier eaters, to jump on the bandwagon, this book is a great place to start!Disclaimer: I received this book for free in exchange for an unbiased review.

"Now that summer is winding down and school is back in session I knew I was going to need something to keep me on track when it comes to staying on the move. My sister is a huge advocate of Fitbit so I figured I would give one a try as well. I’m not a huge fan of wearing anything on my wrists so I opted for the Zip which hooks on to an article of clothing.What I love about my Zip is that it isn’t intrusive. I clip it to my pants and head out for a walk, evening out, or trip to the park and nobody is the wiser. It keeps track of my steps, the distance, and the numbers of calories burned. I also like that I am able to sync it to my smartphone so I can keep better track of what I’m actually doing and where I need to improve. As an added bonus, I love that there are tools that allow me to log my food intake, workouts, and any weight loss so I can make note of trends. This allows me to make the best choices about not only my workout routines but eating habits.Unfortunately, there are a couple of negatives. First, the Zip is almost too small. There have been a few occasions when I have changed my clothes and forgot about the Zip entirely. This resulted in my freaking out thinking I washed it but so far, I have been lucky and found it in my laundry hamper. The wrist Fitbit may be more realistic for me. Second, I have noticed that there are times when my Zip tracks steps when I am sitting in a car. It is detecting movement and logging it; unfortunately, it isn’t the right kind of movement. This could really throw off my numbers, targets, and tracking. Third, my Zip has fallen off my clip and I’ve almost lost it. I’ve actually defaulted to sliding the Zip inside my pocket which is not what I was hoping for. I like the clipping concept which is why I bought this specific Fitbit to begin with. The Zip is sweat, rain, and splash proof; however, it isn’t “don’t get lost” proof. If I drop my Zip at the park, in the middle of the grocery store, or when I am climbing Kilimanjaro (okay, that isn’t really going to happen), I am kinda SOL and that defeats the purpose. I think some design tweaks are needed but that is just me.Overall, I still really like my Fitbit and the concept behind it, I am just not certain this is the right one for me.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.

"Mosquito bites are annoying and unfortunately, it is the perfect time of year for them. My most recent experience with them was at my daughter’s first soccer practice of the season. I arrived home with 9 fresh bites and 3 of them were on my head. It was then and there that I decided that I was going to have to fight back or succumb to the idea that I was going to be local mosquitoes’ appetizer for the season. I decided to fight back with Premium Mosquito Repellent Bracelets from Cravengreens.When the package arrived, the first thing that I noticed is that it is simple yet adequate. Each order contains 10 individually packaged bracelets, in a variety of 5 colors, and arrives in a large zipper bag. Each bracelet is housed in a re-sealable pack which is important as the “life” of one bracelet is 250 hours (nearly 11 days). I like the re-sealable packaging as it allows the bracelet to hold its effectiveness when not in use and it makes it easy for me to leave the bracelet in my car and keep track of it between practices and games.My daughter selected my color for the night (purple), I took it to the field with me, opened it up, and slid the bracelet on my wrist before even getting out of the car. The first thing that I noticed was I did not spend the entire practice swatting away and smacking at bugs; I was actually able to watch my little one practice. I admit that as I sat there I was a bit worried and wondered if maybe I should have worn one on my ankle as well; as the packaging does not indicate the circumference of protection. I didn’t feel as though I was being eaten alive while on the field so I had hope. I’m pleased to share that I arrived home with one bug bite. I’m embarrassed to share that it was on my bottom; a place that the bracelet couldn’t possibly protect as I was sitting on it. That means that the bracelet was able to protect my 5 ft. 4 inch circumference with ease. Hey, I can’t fault the bracelet for not protecting my bum … it did its duty!I find it important to note that I have extremely sensitive skin so I was a little leery and concerned about wearing the bracelet to begin with. I feared that it would cause itching, agitation, swelling, or even a rash of sorts. IT DIDN’T! The bracelet isn’t covered with liquids or DEET. It isn’t messy or sticky and I didn’t feel as though I was sitting inhaling chemicals throughout my daughter’s practice. Does the bracelet smell at all? Yes! I actually held it up to my nose when I pulled it out of the package and smelled a little repellent but that was it. I had to search for the “smell” in order to find it. That’s a win!I don’t know exactly why it works or how but it does. I’m thankful to have 9 unopened packages and a bracelet to wear a few more times before breaking in to the next 9. I also plan on ordering more! ;) This is a great product.Disclaimer: I received complimentary product in exchange for an unbiased review.

"I am rough on electronics. It’s so bad that recently when I got my new phone, my husband wouldn’t let me touch it until a protective case was in place. The problem with this was it weighed a ton and added unnecessary weight to the phone. Yeah, like additional weight is going to decrease my chances of dropping the phone, uh huh! Needless to say, this was a problem that needed a solution sooner rather than the later. Thanks to the Daswise, TPU Armor Full Body Protective Cover this is no longer a problem.The first thing that I noticed about the case when it arrived is that it is packaged like fine china. So much protection for a protective case; kind of ironic but I was happy with the extra steps taken as it shows the company cares about their product. When I opened the box the case came in, the first thing that I noticed is that it comes with easy to follow directions including pictures. That may sound silly but not all cellphone covers work the same.Now, on to the case itself! As I was removing the packaging I noticed that the case is very well made and durable. I like the secure grips on the sides as this makes it easier to hold on to the phone and pull it out of a pocket. I’m a huge fan of screen protectors as they not only provide protection but they also cut down on the dust and dirt buildup that tends to be attracted to cellphones. The case is easy to put on your phone and I like that the back is clear as this is a feature that most cases do not offer.My two favorite features of the case are 1) how light weight it is; as this does not make my phone feel bulkier and 2) the case is drop tested and has reinforced corners. I tend to be a klutz so anything that makes my phone easier to handle and/or anything that keeps my phone safe when I will inevitably drop it gets a double thumbs up in my book.The two possible negatives of the phone: 1) I imagine some people will find it difficult to access the charging port; especially if they do not have fingernails. That being said, this is an issue with almost every case and/or phone itself. 2) I wonder if the clear backing of the case will provide as much protection as the sides. So far so good but I hope that does not become an issue in the future.Overall, I love my new case. It is attractive, durable, and lightweight which is exactly what I am looking for when it comes to my cellphone cover!Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.

"I picked up this detangling brush for my daughter and I am absolutely thrilled that I did! She is 5-years-old and has decided that she wants her hair to be as long as Rapunzel’s (thanks to the movie Tangled) so we have been working on growing it out for about a year now. Don’t worry, it is only a little past her shoulders. ;)Anyway, like many young ladies, my little one suffers from “sensitive head” or at least that is what I call it. If I even get near her with a brush she scrunches her face up and starts to twist and turn trying to get away. She says I always pull on her hair and she is not a fan of tangles at all. Since I’m not willing to let her go out with her hair in a rats nest, we had to find a solution.Enter the InstaSkincare Premium Hair Detangling Brush!As pink is my little one’s favorite color she screamed with excitement when the brush arrived … that is until she realized it was a brush. After explaining to her that this brush is different and won’t create ouchies, I also explained that this brush is special and hers and hers alone. Her own special brush that won’t create ouchies? She wasn’t sold but she was willing to give it a try and IT WORKED!The Detangling Brush glides gently through her hair and removes the tangles and knots without causing pain. Thanks to the design of the handle it is easy for my daughter to hold and my little one loves that because it allows her to be in control of how beautiful she looks (her words, not mine).In addition to not causing breakage, we have found very little hair caught in the brush, it also somehow stimulates hair growth which is perfect for a little girl that is on the path to becoming the second Rapunzel.All and all, this is a great product and one that mommy loves too. Okay, okay, I may or may not have tried the brush a few times when she wasn’t looking! Perfect for all hair types and zero pain, you can’t go wrong with this one.This is a MUST HAVE for anyone that is tired of battling tangles and knots.

"Due to some recent health concerns my doctor and I have been looking for ways to create a healthier and happier me and the word Paleo came up.

Sweet and savory, low-calorie, high protein, and even kid-friendly! Anytime we hear something new associated with diet, many of us tend to shy away but with options, options, and more options the sky is the limit and everything seems friendlier and more inviting.

"I have always been a huge fan of my hair but as I have gotten older and processed my hair more, I have noticed that it is not always a fan of me. Between products, dying, straightening, curling, and every day “wear and tear” I can’t say that I blame my hair for fighting back. And over the years, that is exactly what it has done. I have been looking for a hair treatment, a leave in product that I am able to apply after I step out of the shower and then leave it alone to work its magic. I finally found it, the It 12-in-ONE Amazing Leave In Treatment.This is a leave in condition, a hair conditioner that has left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny; healthy shiny not greasy shiny. I have only been using it for a short time but now that the summer months are hear and I will be spending more time outside and in the pool I will be using it more often. It’s a 10, ladies, a TEN! I step out of the shower, towel my hair dry, spray a few sprays over my head, and comb it through.What I love is that it repairs dry, damaged hair which is perfect for someone that colors and styles their hair. It protects my hair from split ends and breakage; which is perfect for someone who is low maintenance and only gets a haircut every six months or so. And it makes my hair look happy and healthy. All of this from one little bottle of hair treatment. The leave in conditioner keeps my hair shiny, removes frizz, and protects my hair and its color, while making it look natural and beautiful. I couldn’t be happier with the overall look and feel of my hair after using this product.So happy that I have even started using it on my daughter! She is 5 and in the process of growing out her hair. It is a little past her shoulders but she seems to think it should be much, MUCH longer. The problem with this is she has a very sensitive head and brushing her hair can be a total nightmare. After we get her cleaned up we towel her hair dry, spray the It 12-in-ONE a couple of times and the tangles just fall away. Her hair looks long, lustrous, and healthy.Two happy users for the price of one? Sounds like a bargain!Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased review.

"What can I say, I love the conditioner. The smell is a little nicer but again, it would not be my preference as I prefer sweet. There is no lather to the conditioner but I don’t think that is a bad thing. What I love most about this product is how amazingly healthy my hair feels since I started using Amplixin a week ago. I was just coming off a really bad run with haircare products after I tried a new shampoo and conditioner that left my hair looking and feeling gunky. This was a true lifesaver.As I mentioned with the shampoo, it has been one week of use. The difference between the shampoo and conditioner is that I have completely exhausted my supply of conditioner in just one week. That is rather disheartening. The bottle of conditioner is only 8 oz so I am not surprised it is already gone, I am just not happy about it. I would have liked to have seen the results after two to three weeks of continued use but that simply isn’t possible.As with the shampoo, I would love for the conditioner to have a nicer smell but even more importantly, I would like a much larger bottle. For a product that only lasts me one week, $35 is really steep. That is $140 a month for conditioner and unfortunately, my budget will not accommodate that cost.Disclaimer: I received complimentary product to facilitate this review.

"I have to admit that the first time I used this product I did a double take and read the bottle not once but twice to make sure I wasn’t using a product that promotes hair loss. The amount of hair that I lost was rather frightening. On the other hand, what I did notice after using this product is how healthy my hair felt and looked. It doesn’t feel weighed down, it has a beautiful shine, and it looks and feels silky soft.I can’t say that I am a huge fan of the smell of the shampoo; however, I am kind of “girlie girl” when it comes to my haircare products and tend to lean towards sweeter smells. The shampoo lathers nicely; however, the lather goes away rather quickly. I assume this is because it is soaking into the hair so it can get to work. You leave the product in for 3 to 5 minutes and then rinse.My one pet peeve is that the bottle states that you should use a fair amount; however, that is a double edged sword. As someone with thicker, longer hair, I imagine that I use more shampoo that someone who has thinner, shorter hair. My thicker, longer hair and a bottle that directs one to use a fair amount means that I am going through some serious shampoo each time I shower. This is an 8 oz bottle so what that means is after a week, I exhausted my supply.I can’t say that I have noticed a change as far as hair regrowth is concerned but with my hair, I am not 100% certain that I would be able to tell at this stage in the game. I would imagine it takes longer than one week of use to really notice a difference.I would love for the shampoo to smell a bit nicer and for the bottle to be a lot bigger. For a product that only lasted me a week, $37.98 seems a bit high.  At the rate that I am going, that would mean $150 a month for shampoo alone. I would love to have more product to continue the regimen and see if it works; unfortunately, $150 a month for shampoo is well outside my budget.Disclaimer: I received complimentary product to facilitate this review.

"I already knew that probiotics are linked to decreased Yeast and Urinary Tract Infections but what I learned more recently is that probiotics are able to help in other ways. Taking two pills can benefit women. For me, these benefits alone are enough to have me hooked and vested in continuing to take a probiotic daily. BUT here are other reasons why they are great for any woman’s daily regimen. Probiotics have been shown to: reduce allergies, lower cholesterol, reduce diarrhea, reduce chronic bad breath, and reduce tooth decay. Mothers that take probiotics during pregnancy and while breast-feeding have found that it reduces colic and alleviates bloating, constipation, and gas in their babies; I’ll keep this in mind if we are lucky enough to have another baby.A daily dose of Number One Nutrition Advanced Probiotic consists of two pills. The pills aren’t small (a picture is included); however, I find them easy to swallow and they are a lot smaller than the multivitamins that I take daily. If you have difficulty taking pills, this may not be the supplement for you. The probiotic does not result in abdominal discomfort; which is good since part of their job is to aid in such occurrences. Due to the type of capsule this is, it does NOT start dissolving as soon as it hits your tongue which is great.The bottle says the product may be kept refrigerated to maximize shelf-life and potency; however, if you take the recommended dose daily that should not be necessary as this is a one month supply. At $19.99 for 60 capsules I think this is a great value for the product.Due to my past experience with Number One Nutrition and my current experience with the Advanced Probiotic I am comfortable in recommending this to anyone who is looking to achieve “gut health” and bring “balance” to other areas of their life.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate to facilitate this review.

"Like children and adults throughout the United States and other countries, my daughter is obsessed with everything Frozen! We will be leaving for a trip to Hawaii next week and as it will be a rather long plane ride, we wanted to ensure that our daughter had something special that she could use to pack all of her traveling goodies in; this 5 compartment Frozen backpack is perfect!The main part of the backpack consists of one large zipper pocket/compartment. For our purposes this will be perfect for coloring books, books to read, a notebook for drawing, and things of that nature. If we were to use this backpack for school it would be perfect for a folder and notebook; all “book sized” items. The next zipper compartment down in size is suitable to hold her iPad mini. What I love about this compartment is that this is where the Frozen family is highlighted with a picture of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf and it is “puffy” which will hopefully provide a bit of added protection when my little one bounces it around. The third zipper compartment is for carrying colored pencils, pencils, pens, erasers, and I am sure a few other trinkets that she will gather along the way while packing up. There is then a compartment that consists of netting to hold a water bottle or another form of drink and finally a compartment that has a fold over closure with Velcro that can be used to hold a small snack.The backpack is well made from a heavy canvas and after inspection I am able to confirm that it has great stitching. The detail is fantastic including a raised/sewn on pink flower. My daughter loves vibrant colors that are definitely ‘girly girl’ and the addition of the sparkly blue overtones around the zippered compartment areas. Her absolute favorite though is the eye catching main picture of the Frozen family. What I love about this backpack is the wide, adjustable straps that will allow the backpack to grow with her over the years while still providing comfort during wear.In other words, the backpack is perfect and we all love it. As for my little one, she can’t wait to pack it up for our trip and has been “practicing” every night.

"This is my first time trying Organic Matcha and I have to admit, I have been really nervous about it. The tea that I drink normally comes out of a tea bag or bottle so the thought of a tea in powder from that I can mix into smoothies, cookies, cakes, ice cream, and other recipes make me a little nervous. In my world, tea is just tea and now it is green, powdery, and complicated.After reading the front and back of the bag and trying to figure out why anyone would add tea to their cookies I opened up the bag and inhaled deeply. I know this will be shocking but it smells like tea. It has an earthy aroma and I really like it. The powder is fine and an absolutely beautiful emerald green color. In other words, the Organic Matcha Green Tea Powder that I received consists of green tea leaves that have been milled into a powdered form. It’s beautiful, smells like tea, and the bag was already open so I figured it was time indulge my curiosity.Before I tried anything, two people told me that when it comes to Matcha Tea, less is more. I kind of shrugged my shoulders at this, having no idea what they were talking about, and even commented that I prefer my tea strong. Famous last words, right? Clearly I was the one that I had no idea what I was talking about as I added a heaping scoop to a morning smoothie, took a big drink, and literally spit it out in the sink because it was way too bitter. Don’t fret, I lessened the amount, a great deal, the second time around and all was well. I could still taste the tea in the background and it added a touch of bitterness but it wasn’t overpowering and I actually liked it.Here is what I can tell you. As I was informed, less is definitely more when it comes to Matcha Green Tea. The bag that I received for review is 4 oz which I originally thought was a bit small for the money; however, I have since changed my mind. With the amount of product I will use each time, this bag will last me for a lengthy period of time which makes the price more than competitive. The packaging indicates that the recommended daily dose is 1 teaspoon once or twice a day.The product comes in an easy to reseal bag; however, I suggest keeping it in an airtight container. Why? There are two reasons. First, I am not a huge fan of products in bags that reseal as the seal often fails and I keep my tea bags in an air tight canister so it was a natural progression for me to place my Matcha Tea in an airtight canister. The packaging says the product should be stored in a cool, dry place away from heat. For it to last 12 months, it should be stored properly at room temperature and for 18 months if kept under cold storage.Now, down to the details, if you do not like tea … this product is not for you. In all actuality, even if you like tea, this product may not be for you. Organic Matcha is a concentrated formula and that is why I mentioned earlier that a little goes a long way. This is not a sweet product and has undertones of bitterness and that is why you should start with less and add more to taste. I recommend using a blender, frother, mixer, etc… when working with this product as a spoon may not fully incorporate the power into the other ingredients in your food or drink. Last but not least, have fun with it! As with anything, there are going to be things that we do and do not like. The only way to know what we enjoy is to put ourselves out there and try new things. That is what I did and even thought I started by spitting in the sink, I ended up really enjoying this new introduction.Are you interested in trying Organic Matcha Green Tea but nervous about what to do with the product once it arrives? No worries, a recipe eBook containing 50 recipes is included free with every purchase, and emailed after purchase, courtesy of uVernal.I have been experimenting with my Matcha Green Tea Powder for about a week and while I have not noticed a change in my memory, I have noticed that my energy is on point, and I am more willing to get up and go; especially outside, in the morning. The energy boost alone is enough reason for me to continue adding this product to smoothies but the other potential benefits such as a metabolism stimulant and fat blockers makes this a must have in my pantry; especially during the spring and summer months.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.

"I love that my Moroccan Argan Oil is multifunctional!First, my hair! I have thick, combination hair that is naturally wavy/curly. Sounds great, right? It is but since I have combination hair I have to be careful about the products that I use or my hair will look oil a few hours after washing it. In the same respect, if I don’t use product, my curls can frizz and make my hair look atrocious. I don’t use my Argan Oil on my hair daily; however, there are days that absolutely call for it. The past two days are great examples as it has been rainy which causes my hair to curl more and inevitably frizz more. On days like this or days when my hair is being unruly, I spritz some Argan Oil on and gently run my fingers through my hair. This adds a little extra bounce to my curl, keeps the frizz at bay, and leaves my hair feeling soft, and smelling great without unnecessary chemicals.Second, my skin! This two involves the world combination. I definitely have combination skin and the funny part about that is different parts of my body have different types of skin. It is important to note that I also have extremely sensitive skin. The real “combination” part applies to my face. Depending on the day, hour, minute, I can have dry skin, oily skin, red skin … you name it and I have had it. Then, there are parts of my body that are dry. Argan Oil is used as an anti-aging product; however, it is so much more. I have been applying the Argan Oil to the dry zones of my body and have noticed that the area is starting to look and feel a bit more supple. Is this an overnight fix? No, nothing in life really is but the essential fatty acids within the oil work to repair and my hope is that is exactly what it will do. Until then, I will enjoy the feel of the oil on my skin, the feeling that is left behind as I feel softer and more feminine, and the pleasant scent is an added bonus.Treat your hair and skin in the comfort of your home. Two big benefits in one little bottle.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate to facilitate this review.

"I have really gotten into makeup over the last 3 or 4 years. What I mean by that is, more than just foundation and powder. I have worked with blending shades; I even figured out that I wear two different shades of foundation and I have pink undertones. Crazy, I know! One of the things that I strive to better is blending. I started out by using my fingers but quickly realized that not only does it not really even out the tones but it seems to take forever and it is bad for your skin. I then went to those cheap foam things that look like a mini bike ramp. The problem with the mini ramps is that I feel like I lose a lot of my products and I can’t figure out how to actually clean them. So, I changed my tactic and went with brushes. I like the brushes, I really do, but I literally feel as though I am painting my makeup on. Yeah, end in the end I am really not as big of a fan as I thought that I was. A few people have mentioned using a makeup blender sponge so I figured I would give them a try. They all really seem to like them and they love that you simply rinse them out between uses and let them dry. Read that to mean, you rinse it in water, squeeze it gently to get the water out, and then store the sponge in a cool, dry place. Sounds pretty simple, easy cleanup, I’m definitely game.I was recently introduced to the Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge and I absolutely LOVE it. This is a non-streaking makeup application sponge that allows me to blend my bronzers, powders, and foundations so I am able to achieve a more evenly distributed and natural look. With the makeup sponge I am able to get in the crease of my nose and right to my hair line, without caking it into the crease as well as all over my hair. What’s even better is it is made of a non-latex, anti microbial foam, which is great for me since I have sensitive skin and have the comfort of knowing that my makeup sponge does not contain anything that will agitate my skin or get hidden and irritate it later on.Since I am kind of strange when it comes to my makeup products, I wasn’t a huge fan of the color of my Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge when I first opened the box. My initial thought was that the sponge looked a little bland but I then quickly reminded myself that there are no added chemicals to bother my skin so I’ll give the color a pass.A product that is packaged simply, user friendly, and at a great price point is a definite win in my book. You can’t go wrong trying the Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge!Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.

"I'm usually a sucker for time-travel stories, and was very into dinosaurs back about 1971, but I can't say this book is any better than ""OK.""Before ordering this book, I had understood the author wrote a previous book titled ""Chronal Engine"" but I did not know that this was a sequel to it. That became more apparent as I read into it, and I kept wondering how much I had missed.The book is super-heavy with Latin or whatever scientific names for a zillion dinosaurs. These names mean absolutely nothing to me, so they only tended to trip up the story.The story is told in alternating viewpoints, part is first-person style for one of the characters, and part is third-person following a different character. I never saw a book written this way, and it seemed a bit odd. Why not two first-person perspectives?When two generations of youthful family members meet together in the prehistoric past, talk about ""Dad"" and ""Grampa"" and ""Great-grampa"" starts getting mighty confusing. In fact I'm quite sure even the author was mixed up at one or two points, at least in my advanced copy.The characters seemed to blurt out oblique lines every so often, leaving me unsure if the conversation was somehow over my head or just redundant to what had just already been said.Warning: possible minor spoilers ahead.If a 25-foot-long critter like is pictured on the book cover once gets ahold of your leg while you are swimming, I'm skeptical that a swift kick from your free foot is going to send it fleeing the area.It is my understanding that one of the characters purposely hid a time-travel device for a couple of the other characters to find so they would unwittingly be transported back in time. Then later that same character warns the father of these two unfortunates that he needs to provide his kids with a time-travel device to allow them to return. Why the father was not simply warned about the first time-travel device and how to safely disarm it -- thereby preventing the whole problem before it started -- was never made clear to me.One of the characters is torn about telling another one about his future. What he finally does seems like the worst possible thing he could have done.Ah, then we have the obligatory girl with a bow and arrows.Well there was quite a bit of adventure in this book, but in my opinion too much of the story did not make sense. I sorta liked the characters, yet never really felt like I knew them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JYEGEJ9Q5Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544237110#wasThisHelpful","R22JYEGEJ9Q5Q9","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stapler staples fine using some generic standard staples I've had kicking around in my desk for years. The upper body seems to be formed sheet steel, while the base is probably die-cast zinc alloy. I had no problems stapling through some thin 75-page tool catalogs I had laying around. I suppose there must be NFL licensing fees to pay, but the price is pretty high for a stapler and as another reviewer said I don't think the decals will last forever.

"Like other Vine reviewers, I only received one beef stick and one honey/brown sugar turkey stick. I guess our time is not worth much.The beef stick tastes just like summer sausage to me. That is not actually a bad thing; I sometimes (usually around Christmas) spend money to buy summer sausage to eat on crackers with smoked cheese. But frankly, as a snack stick to be eaten bare, this cannot compare to much tastier products such as Jack Link's Hot Squatch sticks, or the good old Slim Jims. If I'm going to eat something this unhealthy and this expensive, I want a more special/intense taste experience.The turkey stick actually appealed to me more, though hovering somewhere between ham and hot dog in flavor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294AVPB8S5Z6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105DW2WU#wasThisHelpful","R294AVPB8S5Z6G","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, my feeling is really split about this one. It is colorful and musical and nice to touch, easily capturing the attention of our 8-month-old son. Our 3-year-old daughter loves it even more and has been watching the Dora and Diego cartoons so I think she can grasp that other languages besides English do exist. The problem is keeping this thing clean. We have a dog and two teenagers in the house, so the floors are pretty yucky. Our young daughter is not too fussy about what she touches or where she puts things. This toy is a natural dust mop, picking up dog hair and every type of dirt, yet due to the electronics inside your options for cleaning are pretty limited and ineffective. Then our baby boy wants to put every part of it in his slobbery little mouth, ingesting who-knows-what-kind of germs. In fact I was not going to bring this thing into our home initially, but my wife twisted my arm about it. The best compromise we have figured out is to strictly limit it to the crib where both little ones sometimes sleep. But then you know it is going to get tossed over the side sometimes.Well the thing has the heart button and buttons in each hand that each play 3 or 4 different tunes or whatever. Also one foot has a button that seems limited to giggling only. It is cute, it works great, the kids love it, but oh the cleaning issue!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YU2WLEJB3G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ST80HO4#wasThisHelpful","R14YU2WLEJB3G0","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got my first Chromebook about a year ago, the Acer CB3-111-C670 which is currently the #1 selling laptop here on Amazon. And it ought to be. So sick of Windows computers taking forever to boot up, Windows computers getting hung up by viruses and whatnot, Windows computers slowing down to sub-snail speed after a couple years of use, I was absolutely stunned how quickly the Chromebook fired up and got down to business. Also the touchpad works far better than any touchpad I'd ever used before, not leaving me missing a mouse very much at all. And the battery life is mind boggling. Over the last year that Chromebook has been my go-to machine for checking email, for checking the weather, and for watching and bidding on eBay auctions in particular. Our 3-year-old daughter also thinks it is hers, carries it around the house a lot, and it has frequently been a lifesaver by keeping her busy watching cartoons while in hospital and dentist waiting rooms. My wife and older daughters also use it a lot, and -- no joke -- it has become the most beloved computer I or my family have ever owned. I have seen those Acers selling for between $150 and $170 in the last few months, and in my opinion they are a fantastic deal at those prices.So, here we have this Toshiba Chromebook 2, which costs a great deal more... currently $430. What does it offer for that higher price?The weakest spot on the ""old"" Acer is the screen clarity. It is not at all blurry, but just seems like there is thin fog between you and the image, paling things slightly. Viewing angle on the Acer is also very critical. Probably more critical than any other computer I ever used. Well this Toshiba has a really great screen, close if not equal to the screen on my teenage daughter's late-model iPod Touch. Colors are brilliant and vivid, text is sharp and clear, and viewing angle is not at all critical. The 13.3 inch Toshiba screen is also bigger than the 11.6 inch Acer screen, obviously.The Acer has very good speakers. This Toshiba has GREAT speakers... easily the best of any laptop I've ever tried. The sound just seems to rise out of the keyboard, bounce off the screen, and reach your ears in superb form.The only ""bad"" thing about this Toshiba is the lit keyboard buttons. The buttons on my specimen are lit so dimly that at first I did not think there was any light coming through the buttons at all, and only light leakage around the bottoms of the buttons. When viewing a bright screen the light through the buttons is both drowned out and rendered unnecessary by the light from the viewscreen. Eventually, by shading the buttons from the screen light, I realized they really were lit. Personally I would trade this lit feature to save power and get longer battery life, but hopefully the letter and number markings pass completely through the keys and will at least ensure that the markings do not wear off as eventually happens on all my other keyboards.I personally live on a tight budget. As a Vine member, Amazon sometimes sends me over-priced dog food for my dog to test, and I never can give it 5 stars no matter how pure or healthy it is claimed to be, if it costs twice as much as my regular satisfactory dog food. In this case I'm making an exception to that policy. No way around it, this Toshiba costs WAY more money than the well-proven Acer. But here you are getting something significantly and visibly better for that money, so if you can afford it and want a really great Chromebook then I whole-heartedly recommend this Toshiba Chromebook 2. It is all that my Acer is, plus much more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYRJCV8PL3TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015806LSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OYRJCV8PL3TB","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good simple toy. Our daughter went through a phase where she liked to put things one-by-one into and out of containers, and I think the slotted top for the bucket will encourage that. The printed card faces are stickers, but the stickers are applied into a recessed area so I think the edges will be protected somewhat and not so likely to peel up so soon. Flash cards of any type are a great educational way for parents to interact with young children, and I do want my kids to grow up feeling comfortable with people of different cultures and languages. Obviously the scope of this little set is limited, but it is an appropriate starting point.The one big problem about this set for me is, I do not know the proper pronunciations of the Spanish words printed on the cards. If only they included a battery-powered super computer that would pronounce either English or Spanish depending on which end of the card I swiped.

"I had a low-end metal detector when I was a kid in the late 1970's. It probably cost the equivalent of $250 or more in today's dollars, it ate batteries like crazy, and the knobs needed constant re-tuning as the stone aged circuitry warmed up. I found quite a few rusty horseshoes around my grandpa's farm, and lots of bottle caps and pull tabs, but never anything of real value or interest. Part of the problem was I felt then (and would feel now) like a total geek to be seen metal detecting in any public place where actual coins might be found.This toy truck is probably toy-like in its metal detecting abilities compared to today's ""real"" metal detectors, but it seems about as sensitive as my old one, plus more stable and energy-efficient. Now instead of looking like a geek I can just send my kids out to do my dirty work for me, disguised as children playing.As far as sensitivity goes, this thing will detect a bunch of keys though a 1-1/2 inch thick wood table top, plus 3 or 4 inches of additional air space below the table. It will detect large metal object like our kitchen stove from 12 to 15 inches away. In operation it mostly makes a pretty cool pinging sound like the sonar on a movie submarine. The sound changes and the green light changes to red when metal objects are detected. It has 2 or 3 volume levels. The sound seems to begin instantly when you sweep over a metal object, but does not end immediately as you get past the object. This makes accurate locating more difficult, requiring more passes from various directions.The rear ""box"" of the truck is a removable digging scoop with a strainer type bottom. Dry sand will sift out, leaving your gold coins behind. I think this is a great concept overall.Negatives... The truck could be built a bit sturdier. It is not horribly flimsy, but still I'm afraid my 3-year-old daughter is going to break something before we even get to a beach. In that respect I think the toy is better suited to 4-year-olds or older; maybe they can understand to be more careful. Probably older kids can better appreciate the science of the metal detection process as well. So far my daughter just thinks it is a truck that beeps randomly. Matchbox shows the truck being used inside of houses, but our floors are so full of hidden nails that it can only confuse or frustrate my daughter. Not only is the detector tripped constantly, but then you cannot see the nail that is tripping it off. On the bed or the couch cushions, the metal springs below become the issue. I'm not enthused about my daughter using this around the lawn, as I can't dig up my grass everyplace she might locate one of those old pull tabs. Then at the beach or in a sandbox I suppose gritty sand will get in the wheel bearings, but that would be an issue with any toy truck. Obviously in soft sand the low-mounted detector ring might sink or dig in, but I think kids will be smart enough to adjust for that. You can play games in the sandbox or with coins under the rug, but I think the lasting interest in this toy will depend on discovering real ""treasures"" out in the wild.Despite a few issues, I like this toy and am excited to see my daughter begin to understand what it is doing better. I think we will have a lot of fun with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T65C2AYD5LEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHCV5AY#wasThisHelpful","R3T65C2AYD5LEI","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This lotion is very effective, but contrary to what others have said it still has a slight lotion smell to it. It may not be a ""fragrance"" that is added intentionally, but some ingredient in there has a bit of a sweet smell to it. I would much prefer no smell at all. Interestingly, our old bottle was marked ""fragrance free"" on the front but the latest bottle we ordered uses the word ""unscented"" instead. Must be the lawyers playing word games?Disliking this girly-type odor, I usually smear a bit of plain old Vaseline grease on the backs of my hands every day during the dry winter months. But that does not soak in and give immediate relief from the dryness like this lotion does.When I was a kid I suffered from extremely dry hands, which would actually crack and bleed during the winter months.

"I wanted to connect this thing to my daughter's PC, just to do simple recordings of her singing using a condenser microphone (requiring phantom power) that she already has. After downloading some very complex-looking ""recording studio"" software, I could not get the thing to work. Finally I tried it on my own PC, where I have some simple sound recording software installed. But my software refuses to start if it does not detect a microphone... which it did not detect. In the control panel I found the AudioBox under ""devices"" but was informed there was a driver problem. The attempts of Windows troubleshooting to fix the problem proved worthless, as usual for Windows troubleshooting. Finally I went back to the PreSonus site and found a driver --duh-- to download. A fairly slow process. But everything is working great now, putting me in a better mood, so I will give this thing 4 stars on the remote chance that I'm just a computer klutz. I'm sure I can get this to work on my daughter's computer as well, now I know what to do.The instructions could be better. And the metal box does have some sharp edges...

Also this one has the 1/x I use a lot... sometimes I divide two numbers the wrong way but my error becomes apparent as soon as I see the result... or I intentionally divide them the wrong way because the first number was arrived at by previous calculations... the 1/x button flips things around and saves me a lot of trouble.

Hydrocortisone creams have been effective, but are not good for frequent and prolonged use.

"The first unit I received was apparently defective. It would not pair as a Bluetooth speaker, and nothing happened when I hooked it to our TV. The manufacturer responded to my complaints, and exchanged the bad one for one that does work.As a Bluetooth speaker it really kicks butt. The sound is very impressive.The setup for karaoke was a bit of a pain... lots and lots of info to enter by limping around an onscreen keyboard by means of the remote control. The karaoke service was free for the first month, it is then $15 per month after that, or you can get a couple days of it for $5.You can select to have a voice singing the lyrics along with you... a full-volume voice, it seems like. Or you can turn off the vocals and just sing to the instrumental part, as you would normally expect to do karaoke.Searching for a specific song seems like a bit of a pain, largely because of the lack of a proper keyboard again.After my free month was up my card got dinged for the next month's $15 charge automatically. I'm not surprised that automatic signup for the service is the default, but I'm sure if the option to turn it off had been made obvious at any point during initial setup I would have certainly turned it off then. Now I'll have to log back in or whatever and search around for a way to stop the service. Our two teenage daughters, who both love to sing, have barely touched this unit since we first unboxed it and checked it out. Maybe they were just busy with summer activities and now school starting, but I'm sure the $5 doses will be the better option for us. If you really get into this stuff, and use it almost daily, $15 per month does not seem unreasonable to me for the service. The service is certainly convenient, if left on continuously.Personally I do not particularly like the shapes of either the speaker unit or the microphone/remotes. The speaker looks like a chrome plated salad bowl with a black puffball growing in it. I do not feel these globular shapes are very functional. I would rather have a rectangular speaker box with the speakers in the front and a flat top where I could stack DVD's or books or stand my Chairman Mao statue. This salad bowl thing is wasteful of space.I'd maybe give this thing 4 stars despite the minor problems and drawbacks, except the purchase price seems a bit high to me. It has several good points, but I can't recommend spending $300 for it unless you really like karaoke.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0V5AI8YKQCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMHG2SC#wasThisHelpful","R2H0V5AI8YKQCN","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I guess if a kid was softened up by weeks of general excitement about visiting the park, then this book might hold his attention long enough to learn something.Speaking of vehicles, the author apparently does not know as much about cars as he does about parks. Upon time travelling back to 1927, they meet a rich guy who thinks the Model T Ford is the fastest car in the world. In reality the Model T (while still produced in that year) was about 10 years behind the times technologically, about half as powerful as the average non-Ford car, and something of a joke all around by 1927.The most interesting parts of this book's plot all seem to be setup for additional books covering other parks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYELY2H213DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825307864#wasThisHelpful","RVYELY2H213DC","A1QK91G8NM5XI1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QK91G8NM5XI1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We were expecting a student to come from overseas, and one of the stipulations required of host families is that the student's bedroom must have a desk. Since it had to fit inside a small bedroom with his other furniture, and since we were buying everything brand new all at once, I wanted to keep it small and inexpensive, but I did not want to buy a hunk of junk, either.Our student has been using this desk every single day since the end of September. Note that it's not an item meant to hold a lot of books and papers. He has a reading lamp on the top shelf along with his Mac Book, and sometimes he also has a pen and a small package of cookies or chips. That's it. He doesn't lean on it. He uses it for its intended purpose. It fits nicely into a corner of a 10x10 bedroom, and he still has enough room for a dresser, waste basket, and to get past the desk into his closet onto the adjacent wall. (Bed on opposite wall.)I don't think you would want to put a full size desktop computer tower on this desk. It's great for a laptop, and if you wanted to put a scanner, small fax machine, or printer on the bottom shelf, that would work fine. If you are old school like me and keep a pile of books on part of your desk, you would bend or break this thing sooner or later. Some people are just hard on furniture; if one of them is in your household, you have noticed this tendency. If that person--the one that breaks or damages everything they touch--has this desk, it will be toast in ten minutes.Although our student does not use it, note that there is a separate slide-out panel so that if you have a flat screen monitor on the desk top, you can put the keyboard on the tray and slide it in when not in use.I should add that it's super easy to keep clean. Just wipe it off with a rag or damp sponge to get rid of the dust. Some metal furniture seems to be a magnet for dust; this desk doesn't do that.With one of my sons, this desk would never have lasted, but for a student with tidy habits and small personal movements, it is ideal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WJCD4AJEV62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QUYFE8#wasThisHelpful","R22WJCD4AJEV62","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this floss, as you might expect, for handmade embroidery projects. I've embroidered off and on for 40 years. This is the first time I have ever bought floss I didn't like.The first problem is a relatively small one: the colors that came in the mail didn't look like these; they are kind of muted, washed-out, and not bold and bright. But hey, my project is for a baby, and my color scheme is pretty flexible.The second problem is more compelling. For those that don't know, each strand of embroidery, when pulled out of its neat little bundle, has 6 threads. Sometimes one separates those 6 threads into 2 parts of 3 threads each; sometimes one might want to separate them into 3 pieces that each have 2 threads. The latter is preferable for outline work and other fairly fine detail. But you can't do that with this product, because even a fairly short piece (6 or 7 inches long) will tangle hopelessly into a knot before you get it apart. This holds true no matter how careful you are or how slowly you work. Just, NO. I had limited success using the piece divided into 2 sections of 3 threads each; by limited, I mean I had a 50/50 shot at getting it apart without it knotting to where I had to throw that piece away and start over. At the beginning I thought maybe it was a fluke, just one defective piece; it can happen, and no big deal. But it soon became clear that the problem was a persistent one caused by defective manufacture.On a couple of occasions I was embroidering happily when one of the 3 threads would break--not on the underside of the item I was embroidering (a baby bib) but on top. There was no knot or other obstacle, such as occurs normally once in awhile when we don't watch what we're doing carefully enough; it just broke because it was weak. Then I had to start a new piece of floss and go back and embroider over the top of a section I had just done to keep it from coming back out, or else I had to pick the whole broken section out and start again.Finally I had an epiphany: embroidery floss is not something that costs a fortune; why not load myself into the car, drive to a fabric store, and buy some decent quality stuff that I could inspect before purchasing? The product I bought in person in a brick and mortar store did cost a little bit more, but is infinitely easier to work with and is much more attractive to look at.I have become a person that buys almost everything online; for awhile, I even had amazon bringing me my fruits and vegetables (limited service area for Prime members). I had begun to believe there was nothing that could not be successfully ordered online, but this time I was mistaken. This product is inferior and a false economy.

"Jackson was a musical prodigy whose talent was almost limitless. His brilliant career was derailed by scandal, and his final 50 city tour was aborted by his death the night before it was to commence. Knopper does the best job of objectively recounting Jackson’s life and death that I have seen so far. His portrait is intimate without being prurient. Thanks go to Net Galley and Scribner for the DRC, which I received in exchange for this honest review.Jackson was born in the 1950’s, a time when the race barrier kept Black performers from being seen by a general audience, with only the rarest exceptions. Black folks could play music for Black folks, and nobody else. The family was terribly poor, with eight or nine people crowded into a house better suited to three or four. They lived in Gary, a steel town in which Black poverty was more the rule than the exception. His father was a struggling musician until it became obvious that his sons had inherited his talent plus some. By the time Michael was five years old, he was the charismatic center of the Jackson Five, who soon were contracted to Motown, the center of African-American music in the USA.Knopper explains how the family’s progression from a Motown act, where they were not allowed to actually play their own instruments on stage and could not use music they wrote themselves; to an independent family act, apart from one son who chose to remain with Motown; to the final day when Michael got himself an agent and a lawyer and set out on his own, divorcing his family so that he could have full control over a solo act. Until he achieved independence, iconic creations such as Thriller and Smooth Criminal could probably never be launched. And he recounts the family drama that ensued, with bodyguards pulling guns to discourage Michael’s angry brothers when they tried to force their way past the gates of his estate, shouting that he owed them money.As a fan of excellent music and performance, I was sucked into the maelstrom produced by the press both during his life and afterward. It’s embarrassing to admit how completely I was played. For years I would not permit Jackson’s music to be played in my home because I thought he was a sick creep who used his fame to gain private, inappropriate contact with smooth-faced young boys. Somehow it escaped me that he had never been proved guilty in a court of law; on the one hand, it made sense to pay one family off in order to take the heat off his career, and Knopper documents the advice experienced, famous musicians gave Jackson to do whatever he had to do to shut that s*** down so he could go back to focusing on music. But the press was merciless, and the payoff, which came too late to do damage control effectively, was portrayed as a tacit admission of guilt. And I bought it.A few months after Jackson’s death, I was in a hotel room on vacation with my family, and my youngest son, who is Black, turned on the television, and there was the second round that Knopper documents, the round of memorial tributes that brought a lump to one’s throat as we saw Jackson’s miraculous career unspooled. He pioneered music videos in so many ways I had failed to appreciate, and he employed so many Black musicians that might never have had a steady job, while at the same time reaching out to Caucasian performers as well, creating a bridge between Black music and Caucasian sounds, transitioning from disco-like R and B to the “King of Pop”. I was horrified at the way I had misjudged him.About a year ago, I read Michael Jackson’s memoir, Moonwalk, and while I took parts of it with a grain of salt, I also came to believe that the guy just didn’t know what was socially appropriate at times because he had never had a normal childhood. I was sold. Poor Michael.Knopper has a more realistic take on all this. He certainly should; he used over 450 sources, and he wasn’t anybody’s mouthpiece. And so the truth turns out to be more complicated.What left me somewhat stunned, in the end, was not the sex scandal, and it wasn’t the postmortem resurrection of Jackson as some sort of musical saint. Instead, I was absolutely floored at the number of people that worked for the guy, some of them for a lot of years, who he left without paychecks for weeks, then months on end. Jackson had a tremendous load of debt, was on the verge of bankruptcy and was saved only by his investment in song publishing, a piece of advice given him by friend Paul McCartney that he had followed through on. Yet he continued to buy one extreme luxury estate after another, holding residences he would likely never use again, shopping extravagantly (the example of taking a new friend shopping and telling him to do it “like this”, as he swept entire shelves of merchandise into his cart, astounded me) while leaving his employees, regular working folk with bills to pay for the most part, with no paychecks. There was no money for shopping, but not for them, and some of them took him to court for it. It made me a bit sick. This man knew what it was like to be poor, and he knew what hunger was like, but as long as he didn’t have to see the people that he had betrayed, he could continue to play out the Peter Pan thread, irresponsibly trashing the lives of those he had told they could count on him, then leaving them with empty wallets and eviction notices.Maybe you think I have over-shared.

"Oh my my, oh hell yes! If Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is a band that lights your fire, you have to read this biography, which comes out Tuesday, November 10. You’ll be happiest if you can do it near a source of music, and the very best of all is to be near a desktop or other screen where you can view and hear the music videos as you read about their inception. Petty made it big just as I graduated from high school. By the time my first-born entered elementary school, I had a backseat full of little kids who bounced their heads along to the unquestionable rhythm of his music playing on the radio. And right about now I am supposed to tell you that I got this DRC free for an honest review, courtesy of Net Galley and Henry Holt Publishers.Zanes has really done his homework here, interviewing Petty extensively, and also interviewing members of the band past and present, as well as other musicians (Stevie Nicks foremost among them) with whom he occasionally partnered. This was my first exposure to the Traveling Wilburys, a superstar group formed just for the sheer joy of it and consisting of George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, and Jim Keltner. Well, here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8s9d...and after Orbison died, his chair was represented in the circle, with his guitar (I assume it’s his anyway):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwqhd...Petty’s story is one of the ultimate success in spite of everything. Born into the kind of messed up, abusive, impoverished Southern home that America’s shot-to-hell social work system can’t even begin to repair, with a father that got along better with alligators than children and a mother who was stricken with both cancer and epilepsy, Petty was ready to get the hell away from the swampland and Florida immediately if not sooner. Petty tried school several times, but English (oh yeah, poetry right?) and art were the only courses that held any magic for him. He had one marketable skill, and unlimited ambition. As it happens, that was plenty.If you want to read his story, this is the place to get it. Zanes has filled it with lots of vignettes, some of which are very funny. When a particular episode or situation is remembered differently by different musicians, producers and what have you, he tells what each has to say.What you won’t find much here is his family, and that is oddly appropriate. Petty himself recognizes that when a guy is a professional musician doing the album cycle—write the songs, record the songs, make whatever changes need to get made, release the album, then go on tour to promote the album, and come back and do it all over again—family just gets left out. His first wife Jane developed some serious problems with chemical dependency and mental illness, and he experienced serious guilt over leaving their two daughters with her, but what else was there to do? Taking them on the road wouldn’t exactly be a healthy environment. Even if he quit making music, who’d pay the bills then? And so it went. So his elder daughter Adria puts in her two cents here and there, but mostly this is a story of Tom’s life as a musician. But reading about Jane’s addiction issues and then watching this video gave me chills (not great for small children, if you have them near you):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aowSG...There aren’t really any slow parts to this biography; the least interesting to me were the various bands he formed or joined prior to his success as a soloist and then as the leader of the Heartbreakers.That much said, this is the first, the VERY first time this reviewer (and all the reviews on my blog site are mine) has ever gone back to read a galley a second time before reviewing it, not because I didn’t get enough notes (oy, the notes!) but because it was just so much fun to follow Petty’s music and read the stories behind the songs.If you don’t like Tom Petty, I question why you are even still reading my review. But if you’re a fan, this is a great bio to read, intimate without being tawdry or prurient, carefully researched, tightly organized. I am glad I didn’t have to edit it, because he probably had a mountain of extra information that was either cut or not included in the first place. But from anyone that loves good rock and roll, it’s uplifting and absorbing.The ultimate holiday gift for someone close to you that loves Petty’s music would be his giant discography, the Traveling Wilburys DVD and CD, perhaps the documentary (which is on my own Christmas list), and this book. Rock and roll forever!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIS5GTDD6U19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPZVR0G#wasThisHelpful","R2IIS5GTDD6U19","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meg  is alone with a 12 year old in her isolated cabin during a Canadian blizzard, when three escaped prisoners land on her doorstep, one of them injured. She helps dress the wound of the injured man, but then is held hostage, along with Jid, who is like a son to her, and her puppy. This mystery is the seventh in a series, but it was the first I had read, and it is easy to follow as a stand-alone thriller. Thank you to Net Galley and Dundurn Publishers for the DRC, and my apologies in being so tardy with my review. The book has been released and is available for purchase now.Those that enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption or that are fans of Val McDermid’s mystery series will probably enjoy this story a great deal.Each of us has a threshold of tolerance for how much terror and violence they can stand in a novel before it stops being entertaining and starts to be just scary and violent. That’s what happened to me here. Roughly eighty percent of this book is set in and near Meg’s cabin, with one aborted effort at escape after another; the writer wants us to also be worried about the puppy, and she played the card well, maybe too well for me. The small moments in which interesting tidbits of Algonquin culture are released, or in which one of the escapees does some small, compassionate deed are eclipsed by the sheer weight of the isolation and brutality present, and I finally got to where I could not stand it anymore around the 65 percent mark, and I skipped to the end and traced it back. That said, I also know that my own tolerance is lower than most. I watch very little television and few movies, and so a little goes a long way where I am concerned.Harlick deserves a lot of credit for being able to spin a linear plot line with a limited setting, time span, and for most of the story with a limited number of characters. She never loses the reader’s interest or wanders off on a tangent; her facility with setting is good, and the tangibility of the place and people add to the terror experienced by the reader on behalf of the protagonist.Scary-as-hell fiction from a series writer worth following in years to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MW0J9N5K8WYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM4ROIO#wasThisHelpful","R3MW0J9N5K8WYE","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Anybody talk to a doctor?”“Guy came out of emergency and talked to the brother.”“Hear what he said?”“Just that they were very concerned with Mark’s condition, and were doing all they could.”“S***. Mark won’t make it then. They’re already hanging the crepe.”Sonora Blair is one of the most kick-ass female detectives to hit the shelves in a very long time. Lucky me, I read it free, thanks to Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media. The original publication date was 1995, and so the initial publishers must have dropped the ball big-time when it came to promotion, because I know this is the kind of story that resonates with large numbers of people, especially women.  And I am glad to see it being resold by Open Road, because they know how to do the job right.So back to Sonora. No wait, let’s go back to Hightower first. What a total bad-ass when it comes to setting! I loved seeing her enter the home where her children were asleep, and the explosion of naked Barbie doll parts in her daughter’s room. I loved the moment when her elderly dog had an accident in the living room, and she was so distracted by the hundred other things, personal and professional, all colliding at once, that it was not even the first thing she took care of once she found it.So we have two interesting threads here. One is the problem. A killer out there has murdered a man by handcuffing him to the steering wheel of a vehicle and setting fire to it…and him. It’s grisly business, but Hightower doesn’t overwork the detail to where it triggers my “ick” button; in other words, although it’s terrible, it is never so terrible that I just don’t want to read it anymore.  And the problem just becomes thornier and trickier the longer she works on it. Clues drop here and there, and the stakes go up.The other thread is Blair’s personal life, and the problems she faces in dealing with home and work. It sounds like a tired old song when I put it that way, but like any really skillful writing, it sounds brand new when the author rubs her own brand of English on it and sends it spinning.After having read several hundred mystery, crime fiction, police procedural, and thriller novels—okay, if I had starting keeping track sooner, I know it would be well over a thousand—there are a handful of devices that are so frequently used that my eyes auto-roll when I see them utilized. I was watching for them. But Blair never gets tossed into the trunk of anybody’s car; she never gets the phone call saying the killer has her kids; there is never a moment when we realize she has been framed for the killing herself, and has to solve it to save her own butt. I’m not saying a great writer can’t get away with any of those; there are some Grand Masters out there that have done it and before my eyes could make the full roll, they were glued back to the page. But once someone reaches into that worn, soiled bag of tricks, it becomes a lot harder to engage me, and I was delighted that Blair never went there.Her facility with setting is consistently brilliant throughout the book.One tiny odd bit: for the first chapter or two, I was convinced that Blair was African-American. When she turned up blonde later, I had to mentally reinvent her. It didn’t take long though, because I was riveted and had to get back to the story.For fans of outstanding detective fiction, this is a must-read. Order it now for yourself, or as a gift for someone you know will love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMET9T16MHD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01543FEAI#wasThisHelpful","RQMET9T16MHD6","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s a murderer on the loose, one that has killed across international boundaries. The weapon of choice? An ice pick. Happily, the case is assigned to total bad-ass Commander Jana Matinova, the best new female detective I’ve seen in emerge in crime fiction in decades. Thank you to Net Galley and Brash Books for the DRC. This title will be available for purchase November 3.Part of what initially attracted me to this novel was the setting. Though Matinova finds herself crossing into various parts of central Europe, she is based in Slovakia, a country not even on my personal radar. By way of apology, I will point out that for most of my life, a giant swath of Europe and Asia was designated as USSR, and the satellite states lined up like faithful guardians around its perimeter included Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, both of which have been carved into different nations since the Stalinist realm crumbled. So I thought I’d learn a little bit about the contemporary contours of central Europe in the most enjoyable way possible—through fiction.Genelin doesn’t disappoint. Along with Matinova, we have a collection of other cops, some of whom garnered truly fetching descriptions, such as this one: “With his thinning hair and lopsided smile he looked like a harmless, slightly unkempt beagle without its long ears.”In addition we have the sinister Koba, a master criminal that Matinova considers akin, perhaps, to Holmes’s Moriarty. Koba’s role in Genelin’s story is complex and fascinating.But most of all, I appreciated the development of Jana Matinova, both for her silver-bullet speed and cleverness, and also for that which is not included. We never hear about her hair, makeup, or her figure; we don’t need to know anything about her love life, and if she experiences any ambivalence about her lack of a domestic life, we don’t hear about it. In fact, Genelin treats his protagonist just as he would a male protagonist.Now isn’t that a breath of fresh air?The fifth star, which I would have loved to be able to add to this engaging story, is denied because of problematic passages that popped up often enough to warrant ten different notations in my kindle: “Too wordy! Tighten it up!” It seemed either as if there were two writers, one more capable than the other, co-writing the novel, or as if someone whose mother tongue is not English was struggling to say what needed saying. I noticed this was most frequent during passages of narrative, and less likely to occur during dialogue. Whatever it is, it could benefit greatly from either some rewritten passages or strong editing. But every time I found my eyes jerking through one of these verbose areas in the text, sooner or later we would come out slick as a whistle, and everything would commence to flow again. I don’t think a published text has ever confused me so much in this regard.That being said, I would cheerfully read other books in this series given the opportunity. Because when push comes to shove, Commander Jana Matinova is a champ!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JA44WUSMZICO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XBIVTE#wasThisHelpful","R1JA44WUSMZICO","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a treat! They say all stories have already been told once, but I’m telling you, this one hasn’t. Oh, trust me! And my thanks go to Net Galley and Brash Books for a wonderful DRC. This one will be up for sale November 3.Some may recall the TV series “The Streets of San Francisco”; the show was based on a set of police procedurals by Carolyn Weston. Characters Casey Kellog and Al Krug became TV characters Steve Keller and Mike Stone. In bringing the series back to us in the twenty-first century, new co-author Robin Burcell was asked to update it, since some of the over-the-top methods used originally could get a cop fired these days, and the old methods would not resonate with the public. Burcell has a lengthy background in law enforcement, and now I know that she is also a capable novelist. The pages flew by, and I enjoyed her improvement of the old series.As the story commences, there have been a series of murders at famous landmarks in San Francisco, and it has been inferred by the media that tourists are at risk. While sometimes life may be cheap, the tourist industry is key to the local economy, and there’s heavy political pressure set to find someone and solve this crime, preferably accurately, but if not…just get someone, haul them in, and charge them.So when Marcie’s neighbor and good friend Trudy turns up dead, there is speculation. Has she been a victim of this killer, or is it a copycat killing?We find out right at the get go that Marcie knows a thing or two. For example, she knows that Trudy and her husband are getting a divorce; they are no longer in love. And Marcie also knows that her buddy has been spending some private time with Marcie’s husband. And so while Trudy and her soon-to-be-ex are going to sell their house as part of dividing the spoils of a marriage gone bad, Marcie won’t sell her house. Because it is her house, along with the eucalyptus grove out in the backyard. Her grandfather left her the house, and he left her the trees. He used to tell her that this humble, quiet spot out back was “the last good place”, and Marcie won’t part with it. Not ever. Not even to increase the property’s value—for herself and also for friend Trudy—by making their homes bay view property. Her grandfather preferred the trees to the water view, and so does Marcie.It’s time to go jogging with Trudy, but Marcie hangs back and hides for a bit. We aren’t quite sure why, apart from the fact that she is suspicious that things are not what they seem to be. Trudy’s been a little strange toward her lately. And what do you know…Trudy dies on the morning jog before Marcie catches up to her.This is a really accessible story, and I thought I ought to be able to solve the mystery. Goodness knows I read enough of them! And yet, I really didn’t get it. The author doesn’t pull the rug from beneath the reader by introducing a lot of new information at the end, or any of the other unfair devices writers occasionally use in order to make their story’s ending a certain surprise; I had a reasonable shot at it, but I didn’t get it. And I loved the ending!The characters—the experienced, fatherly, crafty interrogator Al Krug, and his ambitious partner, Casey Kellog, are well developed and personable, but their personal lives don’t distract from the problems at hand. There are a couple of red herrings, but the plot is essentially linear and easy to follow.All told, this one is a humdinger, and you should read it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356JRGUKAIWN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XBJ5TO#wasThisHelpful","R356JRGUKAIWN0","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bruce Catton was known as a popular historian when he first published books about the American Civil War, because of his narrative nonfiction format. All of the books being released digitally now are ones previously published in a non-digital age. This reviewer hunted down Catton’s three volume Centennial History of the Civil War at a used bookstore some time back, and although they were among the best I have ever read by anyone on this topic, I was convinced that anything he had published earlier on the subject was probably repackaged in this trilogy, and so I stopped reading Catton, thinking I was done. Thank goodness Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media posted the galley for this second volume of Catton’s Army of the Potomac trilogy. Now that I am disabused, I will have to find the first and third volumes also, because Catton is so eloquent that he can spin ordinarily dry-sounding military history into as good a read as the most compelling fiction.Although his Civil War books are not written in academic format, there is no denying Catton’s research or his credentials. He was one of the founders of American Heritage Magazine, and served as its senior editor until his death. During World War II, he was the US government’s Director of Information for the War Production Board, then later worked in a similar capacity for the Department of the Interior and Department of Commerce.Frankly, in order to spin the story of the three battles that comprise most of this volume out in such a conversational manner, dropping anecdotes in at just the right moments and then carrying on so as to make us feel as if he is a journalist traveling with the Union forces and we are concealed cleverly in his knapsack, bespeaks a remarkable amount of research. Only after reading the whole thing, spellbound, did it occur to me that for every vignette he included to make the telling more personal and more interesting, he must have edited out ten or twenty. The result is a masterpiece.I came to this work as a former instructor in the field, and wished I had read his work in time to make use of it in the classroom. At the same time, it is sufficiently accessible that someone with no prior knowledge of the Civil War should be able to keep up just fine as long as they are able to read at the level of a high school senior or community college student. There is a definite bias toward the Union, which frankly is a requisite to my enjoyment of Civil War history. (Those that feel otherwise can go find Shelby Foote’s work.)I never in a thousand years thought I would even consider rereading some of this war’s most painful battles—the battle of Fredericksburg being perhaps the most prominent in this regard—but Catton has some little-told things to say about these battles, and in particular about Burnside and that Tammany Hall political general, Sickles, that I hadn’t seen before. I had viewed Burnside as a failure from start to finish, but he makes a case that a lot of the mishandling of this situation was due to an ungainly Federal bureaucracy that wasn’t good at receiving information and passing it along in a prompt, useful manner. It gave me pause, and reminded me that we should never assume we know enough about something to call ourselves experts.The Battle of Chancellorsville is likewise told in a manner fresh and readable, but the bulk of the text deals with that decisive, costly three day fight at Gettysburg. He gives an even-handed assessment of both Hooker and Meade, and again I learned some things I didn’t know before.Catton’s writing is so engaging that it is destined to live for a long, long time after he is gone, educating subsequent generations. I found myself resolved, at the end of this volume, to look for other galleys of his work to read and review, and when there are no more left, to track down those still missing next time I am out and about.For you, however, it is fortunate that Open Road is releasing this work digitally, so you won’t have to turn out the shelves of every used bookstore in the US in order to locate it. It is available digitally now for your phone, computer, or e-reader, and is highly recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in the American Civil War.Simply brilliant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O4HNTJN8IZMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DJ7DDE#wasThisHelpful","R1O4HNTJN8IZMQ","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brass-tacks biography of US Grant, who served as America’s finest Civil War general and also two terms as US president, was originally written for young adults. Now it is something of an anomaly, and yet not a bad read for the right audience. Thank you, thank you to Open Road Integrated Media and to Net Galley for providing me with the DRC. This book is available for purchase now.Reading this nifty little book reminded me—not entirely happily—of how much sturdier literacy in the United States stood during the 1950’s, when this biography was originally written, compared to now. True, it was a less egalitarian, less inclusive school house that could throw this level of reading at its teenagers, and that is a different debate for a different day. Right now, I just have to tell you that Catton’s boiled-down biography is going to be over the heads of most high school students. In addition, there are a couple of slang terms no longer in use that may confuse the reader. I understood one of them—and I was born in the late ‘50’s—but another phrase left me scratching my head. My two fields, when teaching, were literature and US history, primarily the American Civil War and government, so if I don’t get it, then high school kids will miss some of it also. The book could be used for honors students, most likely, but is no longer ideally suited to high school students.However, I can see its use today for community college students, and also for adults who are not doing research and don’t care to see Mr. Catton’s sources or argue his perspective. He takes a few enormously controversial aspects of Grant’s life and makes his own pronouncements, some bold, some bland, with absolutely not one shred of evidence to back them up, apart from his own excellent reputation, and so scholars in the field are more likely to find his Civil War trilogies more satisfying than this little nugget. But for the history buff who just wants a thumbnail sketch, one book and we’re finished thanks, this could be it. It is certainly less of a meal than Grant’s own memoir; also, unlike Grant’s inarguably excellent memoir, Catton addresses the rumors about Grant and liquor that Grant himself refused to even discuss.Catton focuses primarily on the Civil War years, which I believe is the right way to remember the man, but he also talks about the setting into which Grant was born, and in a relatively short amount of text provides us with the lifestyle and expectation of the average American farmer, which is what the vast majority of Americans were at that time. He carries us through Grant’s time at West Point, then through the wars with Mexico.He takes apart and casts aside, brick by brick, the nasty allegations that Grant’s detractors made then and in contemporary times, and shines an authoritative light on them. What about Grant and the booze? Was Grant really a bad businessman who lost his own money and that of other people? Was he really Grant-the-butcher, as a brief but ugly period in revisionism charged, willing to plow willy-nilly into any and every battle regardless of the number of soldiers’ lives lost? What about his presidency, and the scandal that clouded it?Grant is one of my heroes, and I appreciate the way Catton defends him here. I particularly was interested in his very convincing defense of Grant as businessman. I found Catton slightly abrasive in his tone toward Grant’s defense of the rights of African-Americans during Reconstruction; it was clearly this, rather than anything else, that caused the glow of his wartime glory to dim, because the Klan and Southern white reactionaries were absolutely hell-bent on creating a stratified society in which the Black man did not have equal rights to those of Caucasians, and one determined U.S. president was not able to stem that tide. That’s really what Grant was up against, and what tarnished his reputation. Catton feels he should have been more, um, “flexible”. I personally am pleased that he was willing to ride his principles to hell and back if need be…and that was about what happened.I find it so sad, so ironic that the vast overload of expensive cigars sent to General Grant by patriotic admirers are what most likely lead to his death; throat cancer checked him out of this world only 48 hours after his memoir was completed.Although there are no citations for the facts provided in the text, there is a nice little index that will prove useful to students.Recommended for adults at the community college level, and to history buffs who just want to read one relatively simple biography of Grant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R107MZAQ89PHXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DJ7D70#wasThisHelpful","R107MZAQ89PHXB","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey, these are really nice quality. I bought them because an international student was coming to live with us, and (perhaps because of the bedbug epidemic?

"I purchased this stencil to use as an embroidery pattern for baby bibs and blankets. I figured if all went well, maybe I'd get some more of them. But when trying to trace the insides with a fabric marker, the lines inside were so fine that I couldn't get a very exact shape. The lion's face is too big and his mane is too small.I haven't done any embroidery since the 1980's, and back then my mother told me the cheapest way to get decent patterns was to go buy a child's coloring book and pull out the best pages. After my disappointing experience with this stencil, I got back online. When I had searched for free embroidery patterns, I didn't have a lot of luck, but when I put ""coloring pages for children"" in the search bar, I got way more adorable patterns for absolutely free than I will ever even need. True, I will have to puncture the pattern in order to apply the fabric marker, but I have done that before and already know it works.Long story short--for embroidery purposes, this stencil is both unsatisfactory and an unnecessary expenditure.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26BTW2AAZ0LEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B2R07C#wasThisHelpful","R26BTW2AAZ0LEQ","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Feminist heroes are everywhere, but if I had to name half a dozen women that were at the core of the feminist movement that followed closely on the heels of the Civil Rights movement and the movement to end the US war in Vietnam, Steinem’s name would be among them. In fact, hers might be the first name out of my mouth. It was she who coined the salutation “Ms”, and who founded Ms. Magazine. When I saw she had written a memoir, I knew I had to have it, and when Net Galley and Random House gave me the DRC, I was delighted. But this is one of the few books that if I’d had to, I’d have been willing to pay full jacket price in order to read. Heroes are thin on the ground these days, and we treasure those that still walk among us.My reading records reflect over 300 biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs I’ve read, and I didn’t even start listing them until about 3 years ago, so who knows how many? The one thing I know to expect, when someone really famous sits down to tell us about her life, is that the ego will be there. It might be veiled, especially if the person is famous for writing as opposed to something else, or it might be big and bold. Once in awhile it’s been so bald-faced that I came away wishing I hadn’t read the book so I could go on liking the author. So for one of the most famous of living feminists, I was braced and ready.And this icon’s ego isn’t there. I don’t mean she hides it well; I just don’t find it. And it appears as if large amounts of time spent among Native sisters in struggle—Wilma Mankiller foremost among them—taught her so much about focusing on the circle, rather than a table that has someone at its head, a big-boss type, that she let go of whatever ego she might have been thinking about building. For example, when she works as an organizer, she dreads public speaking, but looks forward to the place at which one part of the auditorium begins to answer the questions from another part, and she knows a circle has formed, one in which she becomes just another person present. I was blown away!Steinem began her career in journalism, and she is one of the finest writers whose work I have read. For a brief time in years gone by, I dismissed her because of her sometimes-attachment to Democratic party candidates, but the sum of her contributions has been so much more that I missed the forest for the trees during that time of my life. Now I want to read everything she ever wrote.Travel is a great metaphor, but it’s also a material fact for Steinem. She grew up with a father who was a traveling salesman, and unlike most such men, he took his family with him. For most of her childhood, there was no home, merely a series of stop-overs. This rootless existence would leave some children traumatized. Kids thrive on routine, and not all would be able to translate constant travel into a sense of the usual. But Steinem mostly remembers it as a positive attribute, and credits her parents for their capacity to question social norms during a time most Americans were madly conforming. The fact that she continued to live out of a suitcase once she was grown and on her own is the greatest testament of all to her upbringing, and to her response to it.There are oh, so many stories, some of which made me laugh out loud, and others that made me think. You can go winnow those out for yourself. And of course, my favorites may not be yours.But the one thing I can promise you is a really great read, one with depth, yet not difficult to access. It’s friendly and feels as if we are having coffee with an old, dear friend, right at the table with one another. A circular table.You have to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AQ7ESH4573U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679456201#wasThisHelpful","R9AQ7ESH4573U","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a rule, I am not fond of British fiction; I prefer working class protagonists to the silver-spoon variety; and I like urban settings more than pastoral ones. But The Lake House is written by the author that produced The Forgotten Garden, and so when I had the chance to grab the galley, I went for it. And once more, experience proves that a brilliant writer can sell any story, in the setting of her choice, with the protagonists of her choice, and she can make it flow smooth as warm butter. This deep, luminous story came to me from Net Galley and Atria Books, a division of Simon and Schuster. Thank you once, twice, and a third time too, because Morton has done it again. The book is a must-read for all that love mysteries and literary fiction.Sadie Sparrow works for the Metropolitan Police, but her job hangs by a thread because she has become over-involved in the case of a missing woman. A toddler was found abandoned in her home, and Sparrow is haunted by the insistence of the child’s grandmother that her daughter would never, ever leave the child intentionally. Sparrow has been told to take some time off and stay away from the case; she retreats to her grandfather’s home in Cornwall, and becomes transfixed by an older, colder case, that of the mysterious disappearance of a child that lived in the beautiful old home nearby, Loeanneth, where a baby boy vanished many years earlier. Sadie sublimates her urge to follow up on her current, forbidden case by poking into the old mystery in Cornwall.Morton takes us deftly from one setting, both time and place, to another so seamlessly that we cannot help being spellbound; this is literary fiction at its best. We meet the various members of the family that once summered in the once-lovely, now neglected Cornwall estate, and we watch across the years over three generations of the Edevane family that lived there, both in the years before World War II up to the present, with its elderly descendants that remain living.Rather than a gripping page-turner, this is a well-crafted tale to be sunk into, like a feather bed or one’s favorite chair, with the phone turned off and a steaming cup of coffee (or tea, if you must) to go with it. Those without the stamina for a complex, well-developed story of the necessary length will find themselves frustrated; this one is for true literature lovers, so be prepared to give it the time it deserves.The characters are developed so expertly that they feel like people we have known a long time. My favorite was Eleanor, who in my own mental movie appeared as a young Vanessa Redgrave; readers of a later generation than mine will choose some other face to match Morton’s description. Every possible stereotype one might create having to do with women of that time and social station has been cleverly sidestepped in a fully credible manner. Even the haughtiest among them is presented with dignity and a certain grace.Some will find the ending a little too perfectly resolved perhaps; I find it congenial.The best news of all is that this outstanding novel has just been released, so you can get it now. It would make a great holiday gift for someone you love, or you could just indulge yourself for now instead. Do it quickly, before it is sold out. A solid five-star read by an outstanding author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO87RO11BUDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451649320#wasThisHelpful","R2AO87RO11BUDF","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vietnam , an impassioned journalistic effort by Mary McCarthy originally published during the US war against Vietnamese freedom fighters, is a once-stirring piece of research that, while worthwhile as a period piece or for specific types of historical research, is in general terms too dated to be of great interest to most readers. Instead, it speaks to the innocence and disbelief Americans with no axe to grind in Southeast Asia felt when they came to grip with the actual facts regarding the war, and how many responded after becoming enlightened.Thank you once and twice, first to Open Road Integrated Media, and next to Net Galley, for allowing me to read the DRC in exchange for this honest review. The book is now available for purchase.In many ways, the American mindset can be divided into two contemporary periods: one before the Vietnam War, and one after it. Before the war against working people in Vietnam commenced, Americans by and large trusted their government and believed what its political leaders said was true. As layer upon layer of lies was peeled away from the startling nugget of truth at the core of this conflict, many people—in particular, the youth of the USA and around the world—were outraged at the many ways in which they had been deceived. Most of those smooth-faced but indignant youth are now grandparents now, and most have learned never to believe something is true just because a politician—even the president of the USA—says so.McCarthy wrote this book during the metamorphosis of the American public from the former condition to the latter.McCarthy went to Vietnam as a member of the press, and was astonished by both what she saw, and by the things that were told her. In 1967, when this book was written, the military leaders she interviewed told her that roughly ten percent of the population, or 1.5 million people, had become refugees, “casualties of war”, because the bombing had destroyed their homes and defoliated large swaths of jungle. It was unclear to me whether they were speaking about all of Vietnam or only South Vietnam; her time there seems to have been spent entirely, or mostly, inside the city of Saigon, which had become so Americanized that there were more English-speaking Caucasians there than Vietnamese.At times, her outrage is sufficiently scathing to take this reviewer back to that time. I was just a kid, but the white-hot rage in the streets is hard to forget, even so.In describing her visit to Saigon, she speaks about the ways in which officers and GIs alike regarded a hospitalized child, a victim of the bombing: because they showered her with candy, dollar bills, had photographs of themselves taken with her, and brought her toys, they considered her to be a very lucky tyke indeed. They made reference to her owning more dolls than Macy’s, and one soldier said fondly, “That girl is so spoiled.”This type of rationalization, the notion that after wounding and possibly orphaning a child with bombs that destroyed her village and left her full of shrapnel, she had become “so spoiled”, is characterized by McCarthy as “Pharisee virtue”, a phrase I found startlingly eloquent.There are other moments when she appears a bit confused, and appears to be unconsciously using the terminology of the very military and government forces that she opposes.  My own youngest child is half Asian, and when I read an expository sentence in which McCarthy referred to the local children as “slant-eyed”, I almost dropped my reader. What the hell? She refers to the Vietnamese policeman that works for the US army as a “small Vietnamese policeman”, and from context, I got the distinct impression that he was not noticeably smaller than other Vietnamese men, and that in fact his size had nothing to do with anything.  If she were still alive today, I would advise the author to check her terminology, and then check her own assumptions about what “normal” looks like. It appears she was carrying around some ingrained racism that came out despite her finest intentions.One more strange factor here was her reference to the uniforms worn by the National Liberation Front, (otherwise referred to pejoratively as the “Viet Cong”, a term she uses freely), as “black pajamas”. Did McCarthy not understand that this was an expression used by the US military which was intended to demean Vietnamese fighters by suggesting they did not know how to design a uniform? Vietnam is a very warm place, and it’s humid as hell, which is why they used lightweight cloth to make uniforms. The jungles were dark and virtually impenetrable, and this is why black was a really good choice of uniform color. Pajamas are something one sleeps in. The Vietnamese soldier didn’t get a lot of sleep, and he did not fight wearing sleeping apparel.McCarthy is not always blind regarding the power of terminology however: she points up the fact that napalm, which had been made even more horrific in that it now adhered to things (and flesh) while burning, had been name-changed to “Incinderjell”, making it sound like a children’s dessert. Officials could publicly state that napalm was no longer in use, because now it was called something different. Likewise, defoliants were referred to as “weed killer”.The only photographs are of the author.For those that want to travel back to the time when Johnson was president and America’s youth were waking up to the fact that the US government did not always behave in accordance with its stated democratic ideals, this is a good work to drop into your reader. It’s very brief, and you can finish it in a weekend.I also recommend this work to students and other researchers looking at this volatile and transformational period in American history. Since she personally went to Saigon while the war was being fought, her own experiences constitute a primary document, and in such a case, I would not rate this book a 3 star work, but rather 4 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22D2HG8145S47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEZ25CW#wasThisHelpful","R22D2HG8145S47","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well of course it’s a five-star book; these stories are the winners! And having just read them, and changed my mind over and over as to which was my real favorite, rather like being at a banquet and being served all of one’s favorite foods, I was at something of a loss to find one that rose above the others…until the very end, and if I had to choose one of them, that would be it. That one, or Russell Banks’s “A Permanent Member of the Family”, a poignant, terrible, magnificent story that I had actually already read and reviewed about a year ago in a collection by that author. So, it goes without saying that Banks is a giant, and I just sort of set him aside with the knowledge that he was untouchable, and then read and compared the rest. But why take my word for it? Don’t just listen to me! Look here at how I’ve rambled on forever without mentioning that I got this book scot free (lucky me) from Net Galley and Knopf Doubleday Publishers in exchange for an honest review. This outstanding collection will be available for purchase September 15. I don’t know how you can bear to wait that long!Okay, let’s try this again. See, it’s almost impossible to compare them, but here are some things I can say about the collection as a whole: first, that it is a multicultural collection, but it doesn’t appear to me as if anybody laid out special rules that said anyone had to vote for this, that, the other culture. They’re all really strong. There was never a moment where something went thud and I wondered how the hell that story got in here. I obsessively made notes on my kindle whenever I came to something that was funny, interesting, or—oh especially this!—when I found incredibly effective, purposeful figurative language. If I still taught (well okay, if I still taught, I wouldn’t have time to read galleys), but if I still taught, I would get a good hard copy of this book to slide under the projector in order to illuminate what the various types of figurative language look like when they’ve been used well. If I still taught and had an actual book buying budget, I would get an entire class set so that students could go through and find the passages for themselves, which is actually a much more powerful way to teach, and then I’d have them write their own stories and be gob-smacked by how much they had improved over the course of a week or so, just from reading a few choice, selected stories.But I don’t teach anymore, and I do read a lot of books and write a lot of reviews, and I am telling you, this is better than what I generally read, and I’ve been reading good stuff, too. The last story in the collection, “Birdsong from the Radio”, by Elizabeth McCracken, is not only outstanding, but it’s chilling, horrifying, and absolutely fabulous read-aloud material for the month of October.But if, like me, you no longer have anyone except other adults surrounding you now, you should get this collection for yourself. Read it on the beach; in a chilly, air-conditioned motel room; or snug by the fire this fall. Because this is what excellence looks like. It’s gluttony for the voracious reader, and extremely tempting, I should think, for the reluctant one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S2W80NDELVQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4VBNX8#wasThisHelpful","R1S2W80NDELVQ0","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whoa now! The times, they have a-changed, and isn’t that a great thing? Thus this once-socially-acceptable novel, a spy thriller steeped in the Cold War politics of the mid-20th century, no longer works. But thank you for the invitation to review, friends at Net Galley and Open Road Integrated Media; I know you meant well.The author presents a situation in which escaped Nazis are developing plans to foment a second fascist government, developed abroad till the time is right. The ones we visit are sequestered in Egypt. At the same time, Israel’s equivalent of the CIA is out hunting for escaped Nazis, who will die quietly and unofficially so as to avoid international incidents. The writer knows his craft well, and shows considerable skill in building suspense by jumping us from one group to the other at critical, cliff-hanging moments.One single sentence caused me to climb off Craig’s bus, so to speak:“It was the brandy that triggered them to drag the girl off the streets and rape her for two days.”Had this been the perspective of a deranged psychopath, a mindset clearly different from that of the good guys, I would have been more generous with my rating and review, but this guy is supposed to be the marshmallow among his set, the old softy who gets himself into trouble by trying to save the suffering damsels.Give me a break.For this novel: no, no, and one more time: no!","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSQQUF7O2F84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S432TA#wasThisHelpful","R3VSQQUF7O2F84","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Morris considers DuBois the father of American sociology, and Morris is right. This is, of course, not the first time a Black man was robbed of credit for an accomplishment that was instead credited to a Caucasian American. It happens all the time. But until I ran across this scholarly study, I hadn’t thought about DuBois and sociology because I had never studied the latter. As an admirer of DuBois’ historical and political role, I was drawn to this book when I found it on Net Galley. Thank you to that excellent site as well as University of California Press for the DRC, which I was given in exchange for an honest review.It is available for purchase now.DuBois was a venerable intellectual, an academic light years ahead of most Americans of any racial or ethnic background. He was the first Black man to graduate from Harvard University, and in addition to his graduate work there, he also studied in Berlin under such luminaries as Max Weber and others. In Europe, he was treated as an equal by those he studied with, and I found myself wondering a trifle sadly—for him, not for us in the USA—why he chose to return here. And the answer is so poignant, so sweetly nave, that I wanted to sit down and cry when I found it. Because once he had the empirical facts with which to debunk the whole US-Negro-inferiority mis-school of mis-thought, he genuinely believed he would be able to elevate African-Americans to a state of equality in the USA by laying out the facts. The racists that created Jim Crow laws in the south and an unofficial state of cold racism that let Black folk in the Northern states know where they were welcome and where they were not, would surely roll away, he thought, if he could reasonably haul out his charts, his graphs, his statistics, and demonstrate flawlessly, once and for all, that discrimination against Black people was based on incorrect information.See what I mean? I could just cry for him.So although DuBois was the first American to go to Europe, study sociology, and return with more and better credentials than any American academic, he could not persuade anyone with authority to bring about change, was not even allowed to present his findings to anybody except Black people in traditional Black colleges, because another school of sociologists, the Chicago school, were busy promoting armchair theories based on little data, or bogus data, all showing that Black people simply were not smart enough to become professionals or take on anything above and beyond manual labor, and of course, he was Black, so he must not be that smart, right?Pause to allow your primal scream. It’s galling stuff. Caucasian professors in Chicago had done a bit of reading, and with regard to Black people, decided that their craniums were too small to hold enough brain-iums. And just as there is one reactionary in every crowd that the newspapers will flock to in order to show that there is across-the-board agreement, so did Booker T Washington stand before any crowd that would listen to him (and the white academics just loved him), in order to say that it was the truth, that  it was going to be a long time before the Negro was “ready” to do the difficult tasks involving critical thinking that had been so long denied him. Tiny steps; patience; tiny steps. Meanwhile, he extolled his fellow Black Americans to enroll their sons and daughters in programs teaching “industrial education”, so that they would be ready to do manual labor and put food on their families’ tables.All of the studies that backed this line of thinking were deductive, starting with the answer (inferior beings, manual labor) and then finding the questions to fit that answer. DuBois had done inductive research because he was searching for information rather than looking for a rational-sounding way to keep a group of people entrenched in an economic underclass.DuBois made the connection between the socialist theory he had studied and the material evidence before him: there were people getting rich off the backs of dark-skinned people, and they had a vested interest in maintaining Black folk as an underclass. Ultimately, he turned to political struggle, and that is how I knew about him, not as a sociologist, but as a Marxist. He also became the father of the interdisciplinary field of African-American studies. He helped  found the NAACP.This scholarly work, like just about anything produced by a university press, is not light reading. Rather, the author presents his thesis and synopsis, and then carefully, brick by brick, starts back at the beginning to build his case. His documentation is flawless, and his sources are diverse and strong. There is some repetition in the text, but that is appropriate in this type of writing. He is not there to entertain the reader, but to provide an authentic piece of research that will stand the test of time, so there is a little bit of a house-that-jack-built quality to the prose.For serious admirers of DuBois’s work, this will be an excellent addition to your library. For those interested in sociology as a field, this is for you, too. And to those with a literacy level that permits you to access college-level material and who have a strong interest in African-American history and/or civil rights, this is a must-read.For these readers, I recommend, in addition, The Souls of Black Folk, which I had not regarded as sociology-based material until now, though I have read it twice; and a collection of speeches by DuBois, which I have been intending to review for some time, and which will soon grace this page of my blog.Morris has done outstanding work, and I like to think that if DuBois were here, he would be proud to see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DTQRJ3LE68T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520276353#wasThisHelpful","R5DTQRJ3LE68T","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jan Walker has spent a large part of her life developing and implementing educational programs, primarily parenting programs, for inmates, and the textbook she has written for these classes is used in prisons around the USA. This book is her account of her work with prisoners of both genders in Washington State. Most of her material addresses her work with serious offenders housed on McNeil Island, a place with a notorious reputation locally because it houses sex offenders. Thank you, Net Galley and Picata Press for allowing me to access the DRC. This book is hot off the presses, and you should read it.The primary purpose of Walker’s memoir is to let us know that 95% of those currently incarcerated will be released to their families at some point in their lives. A small percentage have their parental rights terminated, and a small percentage are in prison–really and truly–for their whole lives. Almost everybody gets out, and almost everyone goes back to their family. Wasn’t it Robert Frost who wrote that “Home is the place that when you get there, they have to take you in?” And so it is with former inmates. They’re going back to those kids. It’s in everyone’s best interest that they know how to talk to them and how to treat them when they return, as well as while they are incarcerated. She points time and again–and there is so much information and so many anecdotes in between, that it’s a good idea to bring her point back to us–to the fact that most domestic abusers were themselves abused as kids. The only way to break the cycle is to teach inmates how to take responsibility for what they have done; and how to let their children know that they have made a mistake; that prison is the consequence; and that it is not the child’s fault.Some of this may seem obvious to you, reader, but the woman knows a tremendous amount. And as a former educator in a low income middle school, I can personally attest to the way that children internalize the things that happen to them. Some of them regard themselves as responsible for their parents’ divorces; I’ve had those kids in my classrooms. And when my first husband died in a manner both sudden and tragic, our children didn’t just think it was their faults; they knew it. They were absolutely sure. It took years of therapy to pull them out of that dark place.Inmates are frequently semi-literate, and literacy skills are crucial to the ability to think critically. So the community college classes that seem like an absurd perk for inmates to receive free of charge, the tab paid by the tax-paying public, are actually beneficial, not only to the inmates and the children that we hope will not repeat their mistakes; they also benefit society in the long run. Better readers are better thinkers; better thinkers make better choices, and they’re better parents in most cases.Walker has seen and heard plenty of the ugly underbelly of serious offenders’ lives, attitudes, and habits. There was more than one moment when she questioned her personal safety when the prison was short-staffed and she was alone with her classes, no one to help even within range of a good holler. She chose not to wear the gear that guards have because she wanted to differentiate her own role in her students’ minds. The gamble paid off more often than not. But she knew there were some mean, tremendously hard people there. This isn’t about that.So don’t think she is some bleeding-heart enabler, because she is far from it. We know that she has seen plenty of ugly more from the way she avoids telling us the most shocking material, rather than because she flings it at us (which she doesn’t). But the anecdotes she chooses to share–with names changed for the purpose of privacy, of course–underscore her talking points, and the work is also painstakingly documented. Do you read the sources and end notes in nonfiction? I do. That part of the book says a lot about whether a writer is just referencing other writers, writing up their own opinions, or speaking as an expert. Walker is an expert.The book starts out dry. Fight your way through that initial fifteen percent; by the time you hit the twenty percent mark, you will be really glad you stuck to it. Although I recommend this outstanding work to everyone, I recommend it especially to public school teachers, particularly those that teach at high poverty schools with large numbers of children of color. I did that for twenty years, and I have seen how deeply affecting it is for children and adolescents to have a parent in prison. Some are ashamed; a lot of them are angry or confused. Some go for a visit that involves a stiff weekend commute, sleeping in the car, and then they fall asleep at their desks on Monday. But the ones that suffer most are those that were promised a visit they didn’t get; that were expecting their parent to be released, and then the parent wasn’t; and those that are convinced their parent is innocent.And here, though you may roll your eyes, I have to address the one little nugget that ricochets inside my brain when Walker discusses teaching inmates to own what they did and tell their children that they made a mistake; prison is their consequence, it’s not your fault. I understand the rationale, because probably 99.9% of those incarcerated (primarily on McNeil Island, which is near Tacoma, Washington, about an hour from my Seattle home) are not only guilty of what they are in prison for having done, but more offenses for which they weren’t caught. It’s also true that there are no millionaires on death row, and anyone that has read Michelle Alexander’s study of the racial disparity in The New Jim Crow, or who has followed the data produced by the NAACP and other organizations centered on BlackLivesMatter, knows that Caucasians serve hard time far less often than people of color that commit the same crimes.  But that does not mean that those that are there didn’t do the crime; they did….most of them.At the same time, my mind kept going back to exceptional people–none of them on McNeil–that I am convinced are innocent. Should Leonard Peltier tell his children that he made a mistake, when he was framed? What about Mumia Abu Jamal? What about the lesser-known Mark Curtis, whose rape case was so clearly bogus that the local chapter of NOW endorsed his case? I know that in the last case, parole was denied over, and over, and over again because he refused to sit down and be rehabilitated for a crime he did not, did not, did not commit and would rot in prison for his entire life before he would crumble and confess to a lie just to get out of that place. He’s out now, but he sat through his whole sentence because he could not have parole by maintaining his innocence.So although these cases are exceptions rather than rules, and I actually think Walker’s program is both strong and essential, it’s worth bearing in mind that once in awhile, someone that says they didn’t do it, really didn’t do it.I have so many outstanding passages I flagged, so many poignant anecdotes, so much compelling evidence. I finished reading this book a week ago, but it is the really excellent ones like this that I have to mull over for awhile before I can write the review. I had 187 notes, and it was impossible to select some over others. I went back and reread them, and apart from a few paraphrased instances mentioned above, I think you’ll do better to read them in context, the way she wrote them.The heartbreaking thing is that now that her classes and text have been adopted around the nation, they have been canceled at McNeil. Some wise ass somewhere decided that volunteers could be found to do this work. Sure, maybe once. Really sturdy do-gooders might last six months, even. But the work has to be done consistently, and you can’t fire a volunteer who phones in sick all the time, or just doesn’t show up, and those that are incarcerated need to develop a relationship with a single reliable professional instructor. I hope the Washington State legislature will reconsider this critical, valuable part of rehabilitation in our prisons. If we can’t raze those prisons to the ground, as the old folk song suggests, then let us at least make a difference for the children of those that are in them.Highly recommended for all educators, for Civil Rights activists, and for anyone concerned about social justice. Actually, I recommend it to everyone. You can get it right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F67YRILPKT2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990310256#wasThisHelpful","R3F67YRILPKT2U","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't play sports, and I spent countless summers dripping sweat while I barbecued in the hot sun before it occurred to me that sweat bands are not just for athletes and not just for young people; they are for anyone that sweats and doesn't want the sweat to trickle into their eyes while they are working!These are nothing special, and they don't need to be. I got a full package of them so I can keep a couple of clean ones in a kitchen drawer with the linens, and another couple of clean ones in the outdoor area where my barbecue supplies are kept.Why didn't I do this sooner?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBQD1L2VVL4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XRLMF4#wasThisHelpful","R3TBQD1L2VVL4D","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sad. So sad! I snapped this deal up when it was an Amazon deal of the day--or week, or something. Limited quantities, great price, but not returnable unless defective; make up your mind quick! So I grabbed it. My daughter's birthday was right around the corner, and she didn't have any summer jammies that fit. What a nice idea, with enough money left to get her something additional.She was pleased when she unwrapped it. But when she went to put it on, the proportions were all wrong. It wasn't really too small, and it wasn't really too big; the lengths on the torso, the sleeves, the legs were all just too weird to even get it on her.This is the very last time I buy something on impulse when it says right there that I cannot return it unless it is defective.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3QMRT0IM71L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URWLN1G#wasThisHelpful","R3P3QMRT0IM71L","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good buy if you know what you're getting into and have a particular purpose in mind. It isn't going to be a good substitute for a regular garden hose unless you live in a condo or downstairs apartment and are just watering a small flower bed or pots by hand. The good part is the very light weight, especially if you are disabled, arthritic, or both. The bad news is that it has to be babied along, and won't take the kind of treatment a heavy rubber garden hose will.I have a small yard inside the city. Most of my yard is reachable by soaker hoses, but I have potted plants on my front porch and a small bed nearby that aren't reached by my soaker hoses. Every day in summer I step out, turn on my little 50 foot hose (mine is royal blue), and I water my pots and the little pansies and petunias beside my porch. When I am done, I turn off the hose, hold about half of it upside down to drain it, and then I coil it carefully on top of a plastic crate on the porch (and out of the sun), where it waits for me to do the same thing the next day. Lather, rinse, repeat, right?I really like the fact that it is so lightweight. The only thing I feel is causing any weight at all on my sore joints is the water inside the hose, and that goes with the territory. We have had temperatures close to 100 degrees, unseasonably hot, and the hose has been fine.So the bottom line is to follow the rules:* drain it every single time* don't leave it where it can be stepped on by someone* don't drag it across anything prickly like rose bushes with thorns, or pine needles*don't put it on a hose hangerIf all of those are too limited for your purposes, this is not the product you want.

"I got this hose somewhere else, 50 foot size for twenty bucks. I bought it after reading the reviews, and so it has a particular purpose. For most of my yard, I use drip hoses, but I have a few plants that are in pots on my front porch and in the flower beds around the porch, and they don't get the drip hose. These I would ordinarily water by filling up a watering can and dousing them one by one.My front porch is covered, and does not get a lot of direct sun, though temperatures here have been past 90, unusually intense for Seattle.I had read that this thing would leak like a sieve if it was exposed to any rose bushes or other prickly plants (pine bushes near my flowers, for example) so I am quite careful not to yank it across those types of plants.Because I got it really cheap, and because I have a particular purpose, I am happy with my purchase. It is much lighter weight than a rubber hose. I know everyone says to drain it every time, and I do, but I swear not more than a few drops come out. But then, I also don't turn the faucet on as far as it will go, only about halfway.When not in use, it is not on a rack, because other reviewers advised against it. I have a crate on my porch and it lays coiled there happily until I go back for it the next day. The one I got is royal blue, and it's kind of pretty.Under these circumstances, I would do it again. I would not pony up big bucks for it, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34630P41E0RZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UK2ZUVC#wasThisHelpful","R34630P41E0RZX","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess I was intrigued by the title and description of this biography. Mr. Rogers came on television when I was entering adolescence, and so I didn’t watch it for myself. When I had children of my own, I tried to limit their time spent in front of TV, and so I tended to watch Sesame Street with them and then reach for the off button. But my son wanted to see Mr. Rogers, and I confess that although the magic escaped me—who wanted to watch this dull man with the puppet on his hand, seriously?—my son, who was three years old, thought differently. I watched the little smile play on his lips as Mister Rogers spoke to him, face straight into the camera. It made my kid feel better. And so I decided to plunge into this biography and see if I could figure out what made the show so appealing to little kids. I went all the way through a Master’s degree in education and came out still clueless, so why not? Thank you to Net Galley and Westminster John Knox Press for the DRC. The title was published in March and is available for purchase.On the whole, I never did find the magic, but from an analytical standpoint, I could see where the work done by Fred Rogers was effective. He treated small people with respect. He was an expert in the psychology of very young children, and his show was crafted around gently, reassuringly addressing some issues that parents might not know how to talk to their children about. This is not to say that he had a superior attitude or spoke down to parents, when he acknowledged our presence, but I was a mom who had spent my entire pregnancy unemployed, sitting around the house reading books about pregnancy, childbirth, and the raising of young children, and I had no idea that my son had been afraid he might go down the drain after the bath was over. And I watched his little face light up when Mr. Rogers sat at the piano and sang, “You can never go down, never go down, never go down the drain!”The first twenty percent or so of this biography deals with Rogers’ religious beliefs, and I nearly had to stick myself with a pin to stay awake through it. The guy was a pacifist, and so although he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister, his belief system and his quiet, subdued manner was largely that of the Friends, or Quakers. So for those who have a strong interest in examining the intricate details of faith as it relates to war and children, this will be more absorbing than it was for me.Just at about the point at which I had decided that grabbing the galley had been a mistake—seriously, 176 pages and I had only read twenty percent? It felt like forever—and gave myself permission to skim and review this thing, it became more interesting. And although I think the author very much overstates his case in calling Rogers “subversive”, I agree that he openly, if subtly and carefully, disagreed with Presidents Reagan and HW Bush about the wars in the Middle East, and before that, with the Vietnam War. He never carried a sign, our writer points out several times, but chose to work behind the scenes and to use his television show as a platform for peace.“War isn’t nice.”He was no radical; during the Civil Rights movement, rather than encourage integration, he held fundraisers to buy supplies for the African-American schools that were separate and entirely unequal, to try to level things out a little bit, one school district at a time. Good luck with that.But the real gift that he gave to small children was that of absolute acceptance. Children were valuable no matter what they looked like. He acknowledged that we feel mad sometimes, and talked about ways to work out the mad without hurting anyone. He recognized that sometimes girls want to play with machines, and sometimes boys might like to hold a doll, to dress it and pretend to feed it. His was a gentle persona, and he let everyone know that men can also be nurturers. And when a company presumed to use his likeness on a tee shirt with a gun in his hand, he took their ass to court and made them not only stop selling those shirts, but destroy every last one they still had in their possession or for sale.He also had blind spots. He was raised in a wealthy family—Mr. McFeely, the neighborhood postal character in the Make Believe neighborhood where Mr. Rogers filmed, was also the name of his grandfather, who built the family fortune. And at Christmas time, the staff of Mr. Rogers’s TV show each got a nice card with a note saying he had made a gift in their name to a charity; but one of the staffers pointed out to the author that some of them were paid very low salaries, and sure could have used the holiday bonus instead.A documentary that was filmed about Fred Rogers was made with the understanding that the cameras must not show “the tasteful opulence of my home”.Ahem.The writer does a fine job of analyzing where Fred Rogers stood on all of the key issues of the day before his rather sudden death due to stomach cancer. If this man was important to you, or if you have an interest in the connection between social justice and religion, or children’s television shows, this might be a great book for you. If you are not interested in religion, you may want to skim through the first chapters and get to the meatier parts.Either way, Fred would’ve liked you exactly as you are now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8546Y63W8DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664260470#wasThisHelpful","RB8546Y63W8DL","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In years gone by, when the fly population in the house got to be annoying, I would tuck a piece of old-fashioned fly paper near the kitchen window where it wasn't too obvious, and it worked. When it was ready to be thrown away, I could cheaply replace it. This year, though, we tossed our old heavy drapes and put light new shades in the dining room. The flies all wanted to hang out in the dining room window, and I could not place flypaper right where our eyes would be drawn while we ate. Gross. So I figured I would try this fly trap.Here's the deal: the picture looks as if you don't see the flies inside, but actually, that yellow label has all the instructions on it, and when you pull it out, you have a cup greatly resembling a plastic drinking cup that you might get at the movies or fast food places. You will still see all the flies. But the good news is that instead of hanging it by the cheesy, awkward little hanger on top, you can just set it somewhere--such as our dining room windowsill--when nobody is going to be there except those flies. Dinner time comes, I move the cup away. Dinner is over, I go put it back.The worst part, which would have made this review 2 stars if I hadn't found a way around it, is that it is intended to be single use. The little packet of fly bait does not divulge what is inside, apart from that it isn't poisonous (the flies are going to get tired and drown, not be poisoned). It vows to work for a couple of hours. So do you really want to buy one of these cups for every day of summer to keep your house free of flies? Of course not.After a Google search, my daughter and I mixed some orange juice, a little dish soap, and a dash of vinegar in the bottom of the cup (after dumping the old solution and a dozen dead flies in the back yard). Works just fine. Eventually the plastic will get old and break on us, but if I only have to buy one or two more of these this summer, I'm okay with that.The container is very cheaply built, so don't plan on modifying it or trying to do anything fancy in terms of placement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHSS0B0NW0MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RBDZ#wasThisHelpful","R1MHSS0B0NW0MJ","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was nervous about this purchase. We had never made creme brulee before, and I wasn't sure I was up for it, but my daughter (teen) was game. And I had seen mixed reviews, too, so I wondered whether these could go in the dishwasher and whether they would shatter beneath a broiler.Not to worry. Everything came out great. They can go (for a brief time anyway) under the broiler; they can go in the dishwasher, the microwave, the oven. They are relatively small (note the specs) and some people prefer a shallower, wider ramekin so they can make creme brulee with more surface area carmelized. Hey, that's up to you. We went the traditional route, and could not be more pleased.Although purchased for a specific purpose, these are also handy for putting small servings of snacks--nuts, small candies, whatever--around when you have a party.

"This is nothing fancy, but exactly what I wanted for a barbecue on my own back deck with my own family. Our outdoor table is metal, so I always toss a cloth on it before serving food. The cloth looks just like it does in the picture. It repels moisture for a brief time, so if you slop something liquid on it, you have the chance to blot it up before it soaks in and makes a mess of the cloth. I washed it, pulled it out after it had sat in the dryer for a few minutes, so not immediately as I would with my husband's work shirts and pants, but fairly soon, and there were no wrinkles.So if you are having a big-deal occasion and want fine linen, I guess you will have to go find fine linen tablecloths and then find someone to iron them, unless that's your idea of a fun summer activity.

"Hallowed Ground packs a great deal of information regarding Gettysburg, past and present, into a tight package. I own an earlier edition, and I used the photographs in it as part of my lectures when I was teaching a unit on the Civil War.McPherson is a renowned author, winner of the Pulitzer for Battle Cry of Freedom. That volume should be the go-to book for anyone looking for a first highly literate glimpse of the American Civil War. This book is only about Gettysburg, as it is today and as it was then. McPherson has not only walked every square inch of the area involved, but also takes his students on tour there. He tells the reader what parts of the standard park guide tour script are actually incorrect, which is particularly useful for those visiting the park. In fact, this guide is primarily targeted for those planning to walk the large area encompassed, but I haven’t been there, and most likely won’t, and I never regretted the purchase of that earlier edition. If I were teaching still, or mobile enough to be able to do that tour, I’d buy this one as well.I am delighted to be able to review the DRC for the newer edition, which contains even more digital photographs. I couldn’t see a lot of them–got a blank, gray box instead, which happens with galleys sometimes–but the quality of what I could see was excellent. Put this together with a lot of other primary sources, including battle plans, letters written by those involved at the time, and photographs that were already in the earlier edition, and it’s clear this is a volume that belongs on the shelves of every Civil War buff or instructor, as well as any other interested party.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3M9UVUB49NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076034776X#wasThisHelpful","R2M3M9UVUB49NN","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Everybody in the country got color on the brain…white folks trying brown themselves up and looking down on everything that ain’t white at the same time; black folks puttin’ each other down for being too black; brown folks trying to make sure nobody mistakes them for black; yellow folks trying to convince themselves they’re white.”Timely? Why yes! So isn’t it interesting that this book was initially published in 1994?My many thanks go to Net Galley and Brash Books for a fascinating DRC.The Blanche White series is a mystery series, but Neely uses this approachable medium as a forum to discuss race, primarily the unspoken caste system that has developed about and among people of color in the United States.In our story, Blanche is invited to visit a black resort on the coast of Maine. Her sister is dead, and Blanche is now a parent to her two children.  This book is the second in the series, and we are told that during the first, Blanche had come away from a bad situation with a bundle of money that she dedicated to the excellent education of her two elementary-aged children. Now Taifa, her daughter, is anxious that she use a hair “relaxer” to straighten her ‘fro. It’s bad enough that Mama Blanche is eggplant-dark. Bad enough that she is not part of the black petit bourgeoisie, but a working class woman…a maid, no less! And so Taifa’s loyalty is divided; she wants to fit in with these pale, wealthy folk, but she also loves her Mama Blanche. Blanche in turn is torn. She doesn’t fry her hair, but she does have a conversation about it with the children.Meanwhile we learn that a woman named Faith is dead, and it may not have been accidental. Like Agatha Christie’s Murder On the Orient Express, it seems just about everyone here has a reason to want Faith dead. That isn’t Blanche’s business, of course…until it is.I do love a good mystery, and will cheerfully sit down to a tower of Blanche books if I can find them.The cover is what drew me initially; I looked at the wide hips and thought this was surely my kind of woman.But race is more than academically interesting for me; my own family is blended and my Caucasian children grown and gone, which has left me the only white person in the house. Most days I don’t think about it, but for years, planning the family vacation was both eye-opening and interesting. One child at home is Caucasian and Japanese; the other (was) African-American. We enjoyed Yellowstone, but heartily regret having been forced to stop for gas in the Idaho panhandle, an experience we will avoid in the future. Now my African-American son is grown and out of the house, but I will never look at the world the same way. It’s been a real education.Surely anyone who looks at this book’s title understands that s/he is in for more than just a mystery story. The depth of analysis kept me flagging pages and rereading passages. I love the feminist spirit our hero embodies.I did find it interesting that although skin, hair, and attitude were discussed freely, African immigrants never even made it into the discussion, let alone into the exclusive resort.The social message somewhat dominates the plot, but the mystery is also a fun read.  Highly recommended for those willing to confront today’s issues.As for me, I loved the blend of story and message. Because really, until the United States deals with the escalating issue of racial inequality, particularly regarding African-Americans… I can’t breathe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEBMB8LZR5JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6NDETK#wasThisHelpful","RBEBMB8LZR5JZ","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Smith is one helluva writer. The Death of the Detective is complex yet hazy, with a million details both enumerated and obfuscated, not unlike a day in Chicago, the city in which it is set. All told, an enormously satisfying read. Tremendous thanks go to Net Galley and Brash Books for the DRC.The time period is the post-war era. With the Great Depression well behind it and World War II a recent triumph, the USA is at the pinnacle of its wealth and worldwide power. Death of a Detective is spun around the lives of a handful of men , all Chicago during this time period, men whose lives intersect and then trail away from each other, sometimes joining again, and sometimes not. The style is a lot like that last sentence, compound sentences that last a long time and yet build up to something rather becoming unwieldy. I have never read a voice like his before.But back to our story. First we have the protagonist, Magnuson. He is retired from his life as the head of a locally famous security firm, and life has not been the same after his wife died. He is depressed. He's invited old friends over to play cards and perhaps talk about their glory days, but the evening is ruined, because one of them has invited a man he detests without consulting Magnuson first. He is so irritated that eventually he abandons his guests and goes to bed. If only he would stay there!Next up we have Farquarson, at least for a short time. Farquarson is a wealthy old man, and a mean one. Perhaps it is fortunate that he is dying. Unfortunately, he has just enough time and evil intent to send out a number of extremely unkind messages, some of them whispered, others sent as poison pen letters through the US mail. Once he is gone, his parting actions send things spinning in all sorts of directions, disrupting and ending the lives of good and decent people...and others' also.In addition there is Cavan. Cavan has lived his life in the self-absorbed, irresponsible, idly dilettantish manner of a sole heir to a vast fortune. After all, Farquarson has no children, and he is the only nephew. He spends and drinks recklessly while planning his scholarly (and expensive) trip to Africa. His field is anthropology, and his budget is one he assumes to be bottomless. What a surprise he has awaiting him.Finally, we have our assassin. The man would probably be considered bipolar today; he has delusions of grandeur and a lot of other strange notions too. He was committed to a psychiatric hospital, but then getting over the wall is sometimes just a matter of persistence and athletic ability. Once he is out, he takes on a number of identities, foremost among them, Death. How fortunate, then, that he has wandered into a murder mystery where he can be useful.At times, Smith's noir fiction is reminiscent of the late, great Donald Westlake. At one point I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud over a wry turn of events.Smith's well-braided story also pulls in additional supporting players with more limited roles. We have a klatch of criminals, members of an organized syndicate, and we also have some hoods that want in and will do terrible things to prove themselves. We have local cops. We also have an assortment of young people associated with Cavan, as well as ordinary people across whose paths our story marches.Because we're all in this together, ultimately.One thing of which the prospective reader should be aware is that the main characters are all Caucasian, and they are generally racist. The ""N"" word drops in now and then, and although its use is entirely consistent with the characters who are either using it out loud or thinking it--think of white Chicago businessmen and cops during the 1950s and 1960s--it is jarring. Perhaps it would have been more offensive simply to assume, as many writers still do, that characters in the story are all Caucasian; yet I think I would have enjoyed the novel more without that particular word, and perhaps with fewer racist statements and thoughts by the characters involved. This is my sole complaint about what is otherwise a truly outstanding mystery.Smith is brilliant at conveying the emotions and thoughts of his characters through action. This reviewer was hooked at the end of the first paragraph, when the man in the diner cut his meat and then stole the knife. Smith's internal dialogues are lengthy but so well done that rather than reacting with impatience, the reader must instead feel as if she is getting extra time with a remarkable story for no extra cost.  His facility with figurative language, particularly simile, metaphor, and repetition are so skillful that I found myself flagging pages to share with students I no longer teach. It was both wondrous and disappointing.I no longer have my students, but I have you, reader, and unlike most of them, you read what I have to say by choice. Pay attention! Sit up straight! Spit out your gum! Oh hell, I'm sorry; I forgot myself for a moment.What I really want to point out is that not only do I consider this book well worth your time and money, but it was nominated for a National Book Award, and the author has an impressive list of credentials. But had he not, I would still recommend this amazing novel on its own merits. Originally released in 2007, it was re-released February 3, 2015.

"We have a family member who chews up a backpack a year. Come birthday or Christmas time, I start looking to see what his backpack looks like. Sure enough, he went through the last one. It's always a challenge to try to find one he can't destroy.It's only been a month, so we won't know for a little while whether Samsonite can break the record, but this pack has sturdy-looking zippers, good strong seams, and he likes the amount of padding in the arms for carrying. His laptop fits in there and he still has enough room for a lightweight jacket or other items.I got a great deal on this pack from amazon, and the young man in question really likes it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EV57ZFWTU4UE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007B5POVC#wasThisHelpful","R2EV57ZFWTU4UE","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was early December. We had finished rocking around the Christmas tree, and had moved on to baking. And then our old DVD player, which we kept in the kitchen since my daughter and I do a lot of cooking and baking, died. What? Couldn't make Christmas cookies without music!I was actually sort of surprised to find a machine that would also play cassettes, of which we still own a few, but mostly I just wanted a simple inexpensive CD player that would fit on top of the shelf neatly (which it does, even with the antenna) and play music without a lot of fuss or trouble. The buttons are easy to understand without consulting a manual. To open the CD compartment, one pushes gently on the front right corner. It opens on its own, so even somewhat floury fingers can reach in, nab the old CD out of it and plant another one in without a thorough hand-washing. Perfect! The sound is not as sophisticated as an expensive machine with speakers all over the room, but it is a better sound than the one we had before it, and we are quite happy.I have not used the radio feature except once accidentally, so all I can say about that part is that my radio seems to work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRMGLSV9ZSSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INEG8W4#wasThisHelpful","RMRMGLSV9ZSSP","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've had this microwave for less than a week, but so far so good. The old one, which we bought at the local hardware store in 2005, went out with a flash and a sizzle. The air smelled like burning hair; it was quite convincing! Since we had a Sharp last time and it had been good for nine years, I thought we would just get another by the same maker, until I saw the amazon reviews for that brand. BIG change of plan! Glad we got this one, and here's what I like:* 1.6 cu ft capacity, just like our old one, which is the largest family size microwave (so to get larger, one would get a commercial machine, I guess)* white exterior looks nice with our white appliances but so far does not attract fingerprints* chrome ""start"" button and some of the other buttons slightly protrude from the face to avoid prints on machine* window is transparent while food is heating, but opaque when it isn't*popcorn button causes machine to weigh the bag, thus helping avoid burned-popcorn smell* dimensions are kitchen counter friendly*turn table is smooth and roomy enough for a large plate or a big bowl of food* features are clear* owner's manual is clear, not that you will need it* We have a few items we store on top of the microwave & below the counter. There is no vibrating sound from them when microwave is in use (but have not tried putting metal on top, only plastic, paper, and ceramic)Here are the things I don't like:* noisy* very, very heavy* 5 beeps. This may not bother you, but we got used to 3 beeps, and so right now 5 makes me wonder what's wrong.If you are a senior living alone and you order this machine, you will need to arrange for a strong person to bring it in, pick it up, and set it up for you. The high noise level does not bother us, but we all sleep at about the same times, and our microwave does not back onto anyone's bedroom. I think if this machine were in a staff room at work where meetings are held, it might be annoying and hard to hear over if you were seated close by, but for the average family, I don't think you can find a better microwave.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15XUP24SEBJCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009KMYGY#wasThisHelpful","R15XUP24SEBJCP","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Andrews has created an historical masterpiece in this massive tome, a biography of Napoleon.  Thank you and thank you again to Net Galley and Viking Adult Publishers for the ARC.Andrews is well known among historians; his scholarship and experience firmly establish him as an expert in the field of European history, especially military history and biography.  The recent availability of a vast treasure-trove of primary documents made this biography possible, together with a tremendous amount of work and travel. He visited and battle sites where Napoleon had been before him, before all of us. (And he set off the alarm in Napoleon’s throne three times!)How long did this take, I wonder? By the time it was published, Andrews must have felt an overwhelming sense both of loss and of satisfaction.As for your humble reviewer, I came to read about Napoleon, whose military career, rule, and downfall I had studied only at the shallowest level during my undergraduate years a whole long time ago, through the back door. My field is the American Civil War, but I was intrigued by the number of Civil War heroes (and others) who had studied Napoleon’s methods in detail, and referred to them when creating their own battle plans. What was it about Napoleon?Generally, my advice to those contemplating reading a lengthy biography is to get the basics down first, but I didn’t follow my own advice here. I had the opportunity to get the ARC at the end of November, and it was now or never. I decided to plunge in, poorly prepared though I might be. When I was finished, I found I had bookmarked or made notes in over 700 places in this 926 page work. So whereas I won’t use all of my references, I can truthfully say that there is no filler, no fat. If you haven’t the patience for almost a thousand pages of Napoleon, then don’t go there, but for heaven’s sake don’t pretend that more is included here than is necessary for a thorough, scholarly, yet interesting treatment.Having said that much, I also have to confess that I struggled somewhat with the ARC. My knowledge of European geography is pretty basic. I know where most of the countries are, what their climates are like, and for the most part, where the borders are located. When we morph into the Napoleonic era, I really, really needed maps, and that’s the price one sometimes pays for an ARC: your “map” is [map insert] noted. There will be a map; I don’t get to see it. So I gamely brought myself to my desktop for the first four Coalition Wars, and was lucky enough to find an interactive map that gave me part of what I needed to know.  In some places, Andrews explained what took place so well that I could see most of the battle inside my head. But as of the fifth coalition forward, I quit trying to find my own maps when I couldn’t follow the action, and just read what was in the book.All told, Andrews corrected some misperceptions I had developed regarding Napoleon. My own view had been that there was a heroic French Revolution, followed by what are usually termed “excesses” by the Jacobins who began the Revolution. (Today these en masse trips to the guillotine would be called atrocities.) But could the whole thing be salvaged? It seemed such a terrible waste to have a popular revolution, throw out not only a monarchy but one unusually lacking in decency toward the peasants and urban poor of France, and then have it all come tumbling down. And it also seems like a waste to have an autocrat take over. This was my perspective before reading Andrews’s biography.Though his approach is both scholarly and balanced, Andrews offers a positive portrait of Napoleon, whom he treats with a fond, almost affectionate narrative. He points out that Napoleon kept the Bourbons off the throne for over twenty years, and it’s true that they returned in 1815 after Napoleon’s first abdication. Things got really ugly then.  And he also points out that Napoleon’s career was unusually complicated. The point is well taken.For example, who invades neighboring nations, overthrows their leaders, presumes to rewrite their constitution without consulting anyone that lives there…yet bestows upon them more civil rights than they have ever had before? And who else would insist in his terms for peace not only remuneration so that he can pay his troops and the annual benefits of military widows, but also demands that great works of art, privately owned, be turned over to him…whereupon he places them in a gallery where all visitors can enjoy them?Mind you, the man is no Robin Hood. Far from it! He makes it clear from the beginning that he has no use for the ‘hoi polloi’, and whenever he ceases privately held property, he also sees to it that the previous owner is compensated.The word “hubris” is often applied to Napoleon, and if not him, then who? Andrews argues that he might have been successful…if only. And there’s the rub, right? Because initially, he and his troops travel fast and hard. In the beginning, he asks nothing of them that he would not do himself. His opponents, on the other hand, are spoiled and effete. They travel with vast amounts of personal baggage and servants. They can’t move until they personally have this, that, the other. And in the end, that is the guy that Napoleon becomes.The text is made more lively throughout with quotations of Napoleon himself, a prolific writer and a brilliant, articulate speaker.The chapters are organized according to place, generally speaking, and this is very useful when the reader needs to go back and fact-check.Andrews argues that Napoleon’s autocracy-as-meritocracy might have been successful if he had applied the standard to all of the dynasties he created after toppling their rulers that he applied to France. Nepotism created endless problems, and though Napoleon somehow thought that he personally might make up for the failings of his relatives, there is only so much one man can do. The many, many worthless siblings and other relatives he installed as instant royalty drained his resources and made problems that didn’t have to happen. His first wife, Josephine, was such an obsessive spender that one hates to think of the number of children under age six who might have lived had the wealth been more widely distributed.Napoleon’s most loyal base of support was within the military, but he fought so aggressively that too many soldiers died, and the backlash was bound to come sooner or later. Yet the military base he so depended upon wanted him back again after just ten months of Bourbon reign.Could Napoleon have been successful if he had left the Iberian peninsula alone? If he had avoided attacking Russia? Napoleon himself, upon looking back while in exile during his last years, recognizes that trying to best Britain, with its unstoppable navy, was folly; yet he certainly kept them busy for a good long while.At one point, he reflects that if he had known he would end up defeated, he could have made different choices. He would like to be allowed to emigrate to the United States; who knows, he could have founded a state there! And here, my jaw drops as I imagine that instead of selling the Louisiana Purchase (which doubled the size of the USA) to the USA via President Thomas Jefferson, he had decided to settle it. But being Napoleon, would it have even stopped there, I wonder? He hated Britain and had nothing against US rulers; maybe he would have been able to kick the British out of Canada instead of fruitlessly attempting to rout them from their homeland.Suddenly I can see how Andrews has become spellbound by what might have been. He has spent a lot more time with this material than I have, and it’s starting to affect me, too!I know that some of those who read my reviews are teachers. I don’t see this as high school material; a small portion of it could be selected for honors level seniors or community college students perhaps, but then you have huge books to buy in order to use just a portion. I don’t see even the most gifted teenager sticking it out from start to finish. Though the narrative is engaging, the definitive biography is epic .It requires patience and dedication on the part of its readers. Developmentally, most young folks in their late teens and early twenties just won’t be there yet.But if you are in doubt, buy one copy and read it yourself, then pass it around a little bit and see how it goes. Likewise, if you are homeschooling a truly extraordinary teenager that you think would gobble this up, buy it, read it (because you can’t home school anyone using a text you have not personally read), and then if you still think it may work and your student is game, give it a try.All told, the price you will pay for this remarkable single volume biography is nothing compared to its worth in your own library, even if only used as a reference source.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OOFLJZ0LQ4YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025321#wasThisHelpful","R1OOFLJZ0LQ4YQ","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sloan Wilson was a veteran of the second world war, and he served in the Greenland Patrol. Here he uses his knowledge of the place to create an entirely unique setting. In fact, Greenland itself is very nearly a character in Ice Brothers. This book deserves 3.5 stars , and as usual I have rounded it upward, as I generally do when I am unable to denote a half-star. Thank you to Net Galley and Open Road Media for the ARC.At the start, I was torn. Although I enjoy both historical fiction and military history a great deal, I deliberately avoid World War II stories that take place in the Pacific theater. My reason is that I don't like to see Japanese people referred to with racist slurs, even though I know that at the time it was commonplace among many Caucasian members of Allied nations. The""J"" word is every bit as offensive to me as the ""N"" word is. I understand that there was a time when Euro-Americans freely bandied both terms about. However, most editors have the sense to remove it and substitute a less heinous term these days, unless the use of the term serves an important purpose in the story. (For example, check the use of anti-Semitic language by the villainous skipper, Lowery, against whom we develop the bright and personal Nathan Green, who hears his name misused one time too many and vows to change it back to ""Greenburg"" once he is back in the US.)So I wanted to read this book, about which little description was available, for two reasons: one was the setting, which will serve as the hook for a lot of readers. What did I know about Greenland? I didn't even know it was Danish territory! A trip down my upstairs hallway to the large world map hanging on the wall there confirmed the story's assertion: sure enough, right there underneath the word ""Greenland"", writ large albeit in parenthesis, it says ""Denmark"". How typically North American of me to have assumed it was Canadian! I surely needed to learn more, and good historical fiction is the most enjoyable way to learn many things.The second reason for my interest was that it was described as a story in which the protagonist hunts for a Nazi ship. GOOD. So, Japan is unlikely to surface, and I can comfortably read without the story exploding in my face.So when I hit the ""J"" word, which was not at all important to the story, but thrown in perhaps as set dressing or to set the tone of the story, I was shocked. The further extraneous reference by a character in the story who asserted that ""...those little yellow bastards can't fight"" made it worse. (Of course, there was no reference to the internment of Americans of Japanese descent; extraneous material here is limited to that which is ugly and prejudicial.) I told myself I would take a break and read it a little bit later.Every time I remembered my obligation to Open Road and Net Galley, I picked up my e-reader, but I had other galleys and other obligations, and each time I thought I would give Sloan's work another try, I found myself reading a different ARC instead. This persisted for over a month; I can usually finish and review a book faster than that, unless asked to hold my review for publication.Finally, I had to make a choice. I went back and reread the introduction. I steeled myself and forged onward. It's a good thing that the plot, setting, and character development were so well done, because that word was used about ten times, and it never contributed a single thing to the story itself.All right; let's look at the story, then.I know very little about watercraft, and was delighted with the accessible, instructive manner Sloan used to clarify the various types of ships and boats and the nautical terms that are most commonly used. I was also surprised and bemused by the stratification of resources apportioned to the Coast Guard as opposed to the Navy, with the Coast Guard serving as the poor cousin that receives whatever the Navy doesn't need. The ingenious ways in which our fictional Coast Guard officers and crew work around the lack of resources, often not at all legally, must have had at least some basis in fact. I found it really interesting, and it drew me closer to the story as I sympathized with the men on the trawler (The Arluk).Sloan's approachable way of describing Greenland's weather and geography were also really useful.Greenland is a dangerous place to sail. Today it is different than it was during that time period. I did a web crawl and was horrified to see how much of it has melted now. Back then, at least, it was possible for a sturdy ship to weave its way into a fjord (which is like a peninsula made of water that pokes into the ice mountains), and then have everything freeze, and the ice might crush the ship and its crew against the mountains. The ever-present tension of a possible encounter with Nazis created a sense of suspense that made the book hard to put down after a certain point was reached, even with the racist terminology, which continued to grate and became worse when Paul and Nathan discussed the loyalties of the ""Eskies"" or ""Eskimos"" with the Danish inhabitants. The Inuit people were treated as cartoon characters, and the static, repeated description of their faces as round and copper-colored and their mentality as ""child-like"" made me wonder where this capable writer's otherwise outstanding skill with varied language had gone. Yet the story still tugged at my interest, and so I made a note in my e-reader and forged on.Another facet of the story that kept me reading late into the night was the ambiguity of the Danish residents of Greenland, and in particular, the character of Brit. Were these folks really held by force by the Nazis that we could not even see, or were they complicit? Whose side were they on? Would Brit betray Paul to them? When he acceded to her request to see the ship, and she curiously nosed into every odd corner, asking technical questions about the engine and radar, I wanted to pick her up bodily and toss her off the ship!Sloan was a strong writer for a very different time. His work could still be really compelling, but I doubt I am the only reader who will take exception to the racial slurs that do nothing to drive the plot or develop the characters. I hope either his heirs or his editors will go in and update this work. It can only improve the story to do so.Recommended, with the qualifications mentioned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWZSS3TOSEQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8KUEKI#wasThisHelpful","R2TWZSS3TOSEQ2","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was planning to order my teenager some new shoes for Christmas, but her old comfy loafers were so worn out from chasing city buses that the sole was flapping. I gave them to her early. She's been wearing them nearly every day for over a month and absolutely loves them. She is on her feet a great deal, takes two buses to get to school and two more to get home in the Seattle rain. Apart from being muddy (ha), they still look great. The leather has stretched very slightly to conform to the shape of her feet, but they still look good. The black color and the fact that it's actual leather and not synthetic means that when they start to get scuffed, she will be able to go over them with a damp cloth, then use shoe polish and keep them looking good a long time. The gradual heel height keeps them from killing her feet, but it adds a little height, which of course makes a person look a little bit thinner. All told, it's a well made shoe, both comfortable and flattering. I expect these to last her years, even though she will wear them often. This was a great investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXTWXOCPYE4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I69GL2S#wasThisHelpful","R3GXTWXOCPYE4O","A1JMKPA2U1X8LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JMKPA2U1X8LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good leather shoe is only good if the manufacturer is willing to use enough leather for the average person to fit their foot inside. Look at the height of this toe box. We should not have even tried it, but since leather stretches, we went ahead and ordered a pair. It does not matter what size shoe you order if there is too little leather for a human foot height-wise. We tried ordering it a half size up, but it made no difference. It is just a badly designed shoe. We sent it back.

"Books that promote a clear message can sometimes trip over the message rather than telling an entertaining story, but this isn't the case with Sweets the Witch and Her Sweetswitch. Delightfully told in rhymes that entertain throughout, this cool kids book promotes exchanging an overabundance of Halloween candy for other good things, such as wishes and toys. There's a real sense of fun throughout, rather than lecturing, and the author and illustrator do a fab job overall.

"This is a delightfully illustrated children's book that seems very re-readable for little ones. I particularly enjoyed some of the messages underlying the story, of getting out into the world and not staying in your burrow, and that there are people out there who will care for you, among a big world of strangers.Miki is a meerkat who's cautious about leaving the burrow, but once outside revels in all there is to see from low to the ground.. A love of exploring almost creates trouble though, until Miki is helped by an old friend and returned to the family, getting a different view of the big wide world along the way. The terrific illustrations and underlying messages were particularly great, while the text of the story was nicely simple for little ones to follow.The only thing that prevented a five-star rating from me was that sometimes I felt the text could have been a bit livelier, in terms of rhymes or language chosen that would delight little readers even more. It is a good children's book though that my infant daughter will hopefully enjoy again and again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I4513T8PXS3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745965970#wasThisHelpful","R2I4513T8PXS3X","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First-time Kiwi crime writer St John, who has written in other genres under another name, explodes onto the scene with this dark and thrilling young adult tale. Jack “Spade” Miller is a wayward teenager left looking for answers when his ex-girlfriend Ella Lewis is found dead.While others lay some of the blame for the apparent suicide on Spade, he can’t believe Ella would kill herself, and sets out to find the truth. A dangerous quest that scratches at the veneer of stable suburbia and takes him deep into the Auckland underworld, where nefarious deeds are committed behind closed doors.St John isn’t scared to take readers into some pretty dark and nasty places in this terrific debut; although it’s tabbed as a young adult read, with a teenaged ‘hero’, there are some very adult themes. Spade is a compelling centerpiece in a fearlessly told tale packed with intriguing characters. A new voice well worth listening to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5ANYQ446S82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=047325011X#wasThisHelpful","R3S5ANYQ446S82","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wellington-based novelist Neil Cross is a transplanted Brit who still sets his own dark psychological thrillers back in his home country. CAPTURED novel contains several of the ingredients that earned him deserved acclaim (including a Booker long-listing) for his previous books: flawed characters thrust into emotionally harrowing situations; menace lurking beneath bleak settings; crisp and spare prose; situations quickly spiralling horrendously out of control; and occasional literary flourishes. Those same menacing elements can also be seen in the award-winning TV show Luther, another Cross creation.In CAPTURED dying artist Kenny makes a list of four people he feels he's let down in the past. Determined to put things right with each of them before he shuffles off his mortal coil, Kenny then discovers that his long-lost childhood friend Callie Barton, the young girl who showed an awkward Kenny much-needed kindness when they were kids, has gone missing. Although Callie’s husband denied any involvement, and the police eventually stopped digging, Kenny believes he’s hiding something. With time running out, Kenny decides to take matters into his own hands, and use any means necessary to get to the truth – unwittingly bringing danger down on not only himself but the few other people that are close to the dying artist.CAPTURED is one of those one-sitting books that can hook you early and have you entranced to the final page. Cross takes the reader to some uncomfortable places, as Kenny’s increasingly obsessive investigations and actions upset the balance in many lives. What starts as a simple mission to find an old friend and say thanks quickly escalates into something far darker – and Cross had this reader on the edge of his seat, engrossed and fully invested in Kenny’s story even when things got a little crazy, violent, and extreme. Crisp and vivid prose powers a pacy and tense story that has some mystery and plenty of thrills, while touching on wider themes like justice, the importance we can place on fleeting events, memory and reality, and what legacy we leave when we go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LEZ5F230ASZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497692741#wasThisHelpful","R2LEZ5F230ASZ6","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young Aucklander Ben Sanders, who juggled novel writing with his university civil engineering studies, burst onto the books scene with The Fallen, a gritty crime thriller that introduced Detective Sean Devereaux and ex-cop John Hale, and was packed with murder, kidnapping, and police corruption. All set amongst the seamy streets and suburbs of our largest city. By Any Means is the follow up to his #1 NZ bestselling debut.In the first sentence, a bus driver is killed, shot by an unknown gunman on Auckland’s bustling Albert Street during Friday rush hour. Detective Sean Devereaux picks up the case, only to discover wildly conflicting witness accounts then a sense the victim wasn’t the true target. But then, who was? At the same time Devereaux is dealing with a double killing in the affluent suburbs: the wife and daughter of a prominent finance company director. Murder-suicide or double homicide? The police turn their attention to the husband, but Devereaux has doubts. Meanwhile, John Hale is largely unavailable to assist, as he’s witnessed a kidnapping, and finds himself the target of a dogged senior police officer as he tries to do his own private investigations.Sanders writes in a crisp and punchy style, powering a storyline that can hook you early and keep the pages whirring. He often has a very nice way with words when it comes to pithy descriptions of people and places, using some vivid imagery, although at times some of the travel around Auckland, and the use of musical references, can get a touch too ‘listy’, which could bother some readers. Overall, By Any Means is a solid sophomore effort, and shows that Sanders is no one-hit wonder. I’m certainly looking forward to the next Sean Devereaux and John Hale tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZMYJUA78ORK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1869508777#wasThisHelpful","R1AZMYJUA78ORK","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liam McIlvanney's debut novel is an intense and thought-provoking thriller that enlightens as well as entertains, showing us the lesser-known links between Scotland the 'Troubles' that ravaged Northern Ireland.Gerry Conway is a political editor at a Glasgow daily newspaper, always receiving unbelievable tips about various scandals. However one persistent caller assures Conway he has front-page-news dirt on popular Minister of Justice, expected by many to be the next Prime Minister. The Minister, rumour has it, was once part of an organised group of Scots involved in the Northern Ireland violence, and there are grainy photographs to 'prove' it. Conway is skeptical, but the more he researches, the more it seems there's some fire to the smoke. He heads to Northern Ireland to investigate, encountering all sorts of resistance and danger as he looks to dig up the past to find the truth.McIlvanney shows a really deft touch for compulsive but thriller writing that also has plenty of depth. His prose is punchy but not lightweight, packed with nuance and subtext. It can be a tough read at times, because there is so much bleakness and violence in parts, and McIlvanney doesn't write in an easy breezy way where little is said as the pages whir by. Instead, this is a higher-level thriller for those who like a bit of literary skill with their crime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWHFW9STZCOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571239846#wasThisHelpful","R2BWHFW9STZCOZ","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having moved from short stories and multi-generational family sagas to psychological thrillers, Dunedin-based Paddy Richardson centres her third novel on the horrifically realistic situation of a young girl vanishing, leaving behind a devastated family and community.A summertime picnic by a beautiful lake marks the final time Gemma Anderson is ever seen. Seventeen years later, older sister Stephanie is working as a psychiatrist, helping heal gaps in others’ lives, while never having truly addressed her own. When a new patient shares a strikingly similar story, Stephanie is spurred to revisit her past, embarking on a journey that takes her around the scenic South Island, and back to her long-abandoned childhood home. Can she uncover what really happened to Gemma?Hunting Blind is an accomplished and compelling novel from a writer that has clearly stepped up, honed her style, and found her ‘voice’.Richardson takes readers into the aftermath of high-profile tragedies; the ongoing effects that remain long after the media circus leaves, and the rest of the country forgets. The plot lags just a touch during several chapters of psychiatry sessions, before kicking into high gear, but overall this is a good page-turner - a very enjoyable and thought-provoking read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZZGL9M8H46P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFQXZOW#wasThisHelpful","R3GZZGL9M8H46P","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Debutant British author Belinda Bauer burst onto the scene with this CWA Gold Dagger-winning tale of a nave but determined 12-year old investigating the long-ago disappearance of his uncle - an event that decades later still hangs over his working class family like a choking mist.Fatherless Steven Lamb feels overlooked by his struggling mother and his emotionally crippled Nan, who still waits by the window for her son, Steven’s uncle Billy, to come home, more than twenty years after many people think the 11-year-old was snatched, murdered, and buried somewhere on Exmoor by notorious child killer Arnold Avery. While Steven’s schoolmates hang out and swap football stickers, he spends his afternoons and weekends digging the moor, hoping to uncover his uncle’s body and allow his family to heal and move on. Getting desperate, Steven decides to ask the only person that might know where Uncle Billy was buried. He writes to Avery, who’s spent 18 years behind bars, kick-starting a dangerous cat and mouse game with the bored paedophile.On its surface, Blacklands is a deceptively simple story, yet Bauer imbues it with layers; fully-realised characters struggling at the margins of society, a well-evoked sense of both the wild beauty of the moors, and the ongoing effects on a family and community of horrific crime, long after the headlines have faded","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17PKZVT2KK7FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439149453#wasThisHelpful","R17PKZVT2KK7FM","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"n BLACK ICE, her third in a series featuring city detective Jill Jackson, Giarratano picks at the scab of Sydney’s murky drugs underbelly; a world where everyone from glamorous A-Listers to addicted streetkids to and vicious gangs, all collide.The publisher's blurb states: ""Living in a run down flat and making unlikely friends Jill sees first hand what devastation the illegal drugs scene can wreak. Jill's sister Cassie has a new boyfriend Christian Worthington. Like her, he is one of the beautiful people of Sydney, rich, good looking, great job, great car and seen in all the right places. He is a high flying lawyer doing pro bono work to keep a drug dealer out of gaol. He is also Cassie's supplier, keeping her supplied with cocaine and ice. When Cassie overdoses and is dumped at the hospital her life begins to spiral out of control. Seren Templeton is just out of Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre. Two years in gaol away from her son for something she didn't do. And now she is ready to get her revenge on the man responsible. Things start to go awry when these worlds collide and Jill and Cassie meet on opposite sides of the law.""I really enjoyed this book, and I found myself enjoying it more and more as it went on. I ended up giving it a 4-star rating for a short review I did for Good Reading magazine (I mark reasonably hard - I've only ever given two five-star reviews out of 40-50 reviews for them).I must admit that initially I wasn't that enamoured with Jackson as a main character - this may have been because I didn't have the full background on her from the first two books of the series, so some of her behaviour seemed a touch eye-rolling/contrived to me, when it may have seemed more organic and believable if I'd known more about her and her past. But Jackson (and Giarratano's writing) really grew on me throughout, and by the end of the book I was keen to read another tale centred on the (overly?) ambitious, complex, and flawed detective.I particularly liked Giarratano's mix of setting (the gritty urban Australia underbelly), good dialogue, interesting plot, and some unique and memorable characters. BLACK ICE has a real modern, contemporary feel - not just because of the modern lifestyles and drugs involved, but the punchy way in which Giarratano writes, and her fresh evocation of the different layers of Australian drugs culture. Overall Giarratano pens a taut thriller; she excels in bringing the gritty world and her unique characters to life with realism and freshness.If I have a quibble, it's that at times at times I could see the psychologist in her coming through a little too much, especially when it came to 'excusing' or mitigating the actions of some characters (particularly any female character - whose flaws always seemed to come down to how badly she'd been treated by some man in her past). The consistency of this pulled me out of the story a little at times, as I was left thinking about the author and her approach, rather than being completely and totally involved with the characters and story - you could 'see the author's hand' a little, which isn't a good thing. However, this was a very minor flaw in an otherwise great read.The freshness of Giarratano's writing, her wonderful scene-setting, her unique characters, and her good plotting, will all bring me back for more. A good read for anyone looking for some very modern and contemporary city-set Australian crime fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYU0T8YZE6CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741668093#wasThisHelpful","R1SYU0T8YZE6CT","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Burdett's debut introduces his unique hero, Thai police detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep, a fair-skinned Thai and a devout Buddhist who commutes daily between the sacred precepts of his religion and the profane delights the city has to offer.In BANGKOK EIGHT, Jitpleecheep's partner and 'soul brother' is killed when the pair come across an African-American marine sergeant locked inside a Mercedes with a maddened python and a swarm of cobras. Sworn to vengeance, Jitpleecheep works his into the seedy underbelly of Bangkok, where 'desire rules and the human body is as custom-designable as a raw hunk of jade' - and where Sonchai eventually tracks the killer, a predator of an even more sinister variety.Quite simply, BANGKOK EIGHT is one of the best debut novels I've read in a long, long time. It stays with you weeks after you finish reading it. The writing is fresh and original, as are the characters, and Burdett does a great job weaving both the halluconigenic and contradictory atmosphere of Bangkok, and some interesting philosophical questions, into the exciting storyline.Jitpleecheep is very much a character worth following - full of unique touches and contradictory emotions and actions - a fully-rounded protagonist that I will enjoying reading more about throughout the series.Burdett seems to have struck that great balance between exciting storyline, interesting characters, evocative description, and good dialogue and wider insights, that writers in the upper echelon of the crime fiction canon have mastered, eg Michael Connelly, Mark Billingham, Val McDermid, James Lee Burke etc. BANGKOK EIGHT is not a book where one strong aspect overwhelms or overshadows other weaker ones - it's a fully-rounded story from an excellent writer.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKA1FH6QI74Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400032903#wasThisHelpful","R2PKA1FH6QI74Z","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A nicely illustrated children's tale that has a cast of jungle characters running a race. While most are scared off by a slimey snake, two heroes emerge to show that positive thinking can overcome fear. It's a good message for children to learn, and the book has some nice rhymes. However the verses are a bit consistent - some of the rhyming and phrasing feels clunky or forced, while others are smooth and full of delight. A mixed bag in terms of the text, the illustrations are very good overall, full of colour and life. This is a book that many parents can enjoy reading to their children, a fun wee story with a good message","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQGZEH7GMNCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1490432523#wasThisHelpful","R2HQGZEH7GMNCY","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very intrigued by the idea behind Brisbane journalist Belinda Pollard's debut novel - a 'who's the unknown killer in the group' adventure thriller set in one of New Zealand's most ruggedly gorgeous national parks: Fiordland. A sort of And Then There Were None in the heart of majestic Lord of the Rings locations. So there was a lot of promise behind the premise, and setting.Unfortunately, for me, the book only semi-delivered, falling short of what it could have been. At the beginning, I couldn't quite pick what was bothering me. The story starts with a historic day in Queensland, a group of high school friends witnessing a tragedy. Then it kicks forward to Callie Brown, one of those high schoolers but now a successful television journalist, contemplating a long-planned reunion of sorts with those same friends, many of whom she hasn't spoken to in years, in the wilds of southern New Zealand. She's not sure if she, and some of the others, can hack such an arduous adventure trip. Or if she wants to confront some of the longheld mixed feelings she has about some of the others in the party.It's a good set-up for what could be a great thriller. As the story unfolded however, I found myself regularly pulled out of the tale by bouts of unnatural and over-expository dialogue. Things were laid out for the reader - and not in subtle or subtextual ways - in the characters' conversations. At other times long-simmering misunderstandings were neatly resolved with a few 'confess all' statements that just didn't seem to ring true. The author's hand was evident a lot, rather than things seeming to naturally unfold from the set-up and characters and storylines. Things felt a little 'on the nose' and forced - and subsequently a little 'thin'.Despite being irritated by this, and other faults, I was intrigued by the story set-up, and Pollard created enough of a 'I want to know what happens' effect, a bit of narrative drive, that I found myself persevering and continuing to turn the pages. I was rewarded as the action picked up, and death(s) were visited upon our intrepid adventurers. There were also some nice descriptions of Fiordland, and ideas of how the wilderness, for all it's phenomenal beauty, can be a very tough and unforgiving place. As those left behind begin to worry about the missing hikers, and we cut between those in town and those in the bush, Pollard did a great job of keeping me hooked on what was happening. I wanted to know how it would turn out.There are also some interesting themes that arise throughout the story, such as the nexus between media coverage and tragedies, the complications of childhood friendships and secrets withheld, and how we can be quick to (mis)judge those around us. Overall, POISON BAY was a pretty good read that I imagine many readers would enjoy, but for me I was left with a feeling that the pieces were there for something more, and another edit or partial rewrite could have polished it to something really great","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F36ZAJ3N22TE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0994209800#wasThisHelpful","R1F36ZAJ3N22TE","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Luther is one of those television shows that divides people, viewers and critics alike. To say the psychological crime drama received a mixed response when its first season, created and written by Wellington-based novelist and screenwriter Neil Cross, debuted in the UK last year, doesn’t do justice to the divergent viewpoints it incited. Some hailed Luther as one of the very best things on TV in years. Others wrote it off as violent, over-the-top nonsense. One prominent UK critic even publicly changed his mind mid-season, backtracking on an earlier negative review – almost unheard of. The show received awards acclaim – including Golden Globe and Emmy Nominations for Best Actor for lead Idris Elba (who plays John Luther) and a prestigious TV writing award for Cross – but first season ratings were so-so.Given all the above, it was with more than mild curiosity that I recently popped the first disc into my DVD player, and settled in to watch Cross’s creation, and make up my own mind. As the title credits rolled, I wondered, would I love it, or hate it? Or fall somewhere in between.Luther (Elba, of The Wire fame) is a near-genius detective with an explosive personality. He gets inside the heads of the worst criminals, but his work weighs heavy on him, and his personal life has fractured. In the first episode, Luther returns from extended leave (months earlier a child killer he was pursuing ‘fell’ and is now in a coma) to investigate a brutal killing, a case that introduces him to Alice (Ruth Morgan), a young woman with much going on beneath her cold exterior. His planned reconciliation with estranged wife Zoe flops – she’s met someone else – and he throws himself even more into work, the very thing that’s undone his equilibrium in the past.Elba is magnetic as Luther, bringing a gravitas to the role that transfixes even when things veer towards theatrical. Whether he was throwing things through windows or sitting quietly alone, I was mesmerised by his portrayal of a troubled man treading a tightrope between intelligence and insanity. But it’s not a one-man show; there are strong performances across the board, from Morgan’s Alice, to Indira Varma as Zoe, Saskia Reeves as Luther’s boss, and Paul McGann as Zoe’s new lover. Each brings emotion and authenticity to the roles, none are caricatures.Viewers will quickly notice Luther ‘looks’ different to other British TV. It is shot beautifully, giving it a more cinematic than ultra-real ‘police procedural’ look and feel. Each of the six episodes of the first season is exciting in itself, while at the same time ongoing issues bubble away in the background, exploding by the finale, where Luther is accused of a brutal murder and must enlist some unlikely allies to help catch the real killer before his colleagues – who think he’s finally gone off the deep end – catch him.Overall, I absolutely loved Luther. Was it over-the-top, less than realistic, as some said? Yes. Did it verge on theatrical? Yes. But damn it is good. Very, very good. For me, one of the best TV shows I’ve watched in years. I accept it’s the type of show that not everyone will enjoy – it will ‘click’ or resonate with some, and not others. I’m just glad it works for me, because now I can really look forward to season two, which recently screened in Britain to widespread acclaim, and much higher ratings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXNEAHJABU86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041QSZFG#wasThisHelpful","R2NXNEAHJABU86","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In short, The World of WearableArt is the perfect ‘coffee table’ book; ideal for flicking through again and again, admiring the ideas, intricacy, and brilliance that went into many of the garments on show. The more you look, the more you see, and the more you’re impressed. Car parts, wood shavings, potato chip packets, seaweed, slices of toast, old telephone parts, paper clips, corrugated iron, gloves, feathers – a mind-boggling array of unusual materials have sparked entries from fashion designers, artists and costume makers the world over.In effect the book is a lovely photo-essay of a remarkable Nelson-born competition and award show that has become a cultural phenomenon, deservedly lauded here and overseas.

"A delightful, classic tale of less-than-monstrous monster Mervyn, who is not your typical monster and finds his place with the local villagers, who learn to appreciate him after overcoming their fears.A children's book that is bright, colourful, and smile-inducing in its simplicity, it smacks of another age (it was originally written in the 1970s by a legendary Dutch children's author and illustrator), which may be criticised by some. But my daughter and I enjoyed the tale.There is some nice prose, two good if straightforward stories, and some morals and themes beneath the plotting. One quibble is that some of the best illustrations are not on the pages matching the words (ie you need to turn the page to see what has just been 'told'), but that's not that big of a deal. A lovely book, that could be read repeatedly to smaller children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSWJN8QNVMV0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0735841071#wasThisHelpful","RSWJN8QNVMV0Z","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paroled rapist Richard Knox decides he wants to make a new life in the Aberdeen, forcing Granite City’s finest to protect him from an outraged populace. Meanwhile MacBride's recurring hero DS Logan McRae is under the cosh from all directions: his superiors are overloading him and questioning his attitude; he’s hitting the drink increasingly hard; he’s spending more time before Professional Standards than dealing with his massive caseload packed with counterfeit money and goods, murder, flashers, and robbery; and the local crime lord is leaving him envelopes of cash...MacBride’s touch for character interaction and team dynamics (complete with realistic if coarse language and off-colour humour) is once again to the fore, as he delivers another solid instalment in an excellent series. Readers can’t help but feel for (and follow) beleaguered McRae, as he tries to weather the storms both natural and political, solve several cases, pull himself from his malaise, and decide if he even wants to remain a cop.Not the best in the series, but a good read nonetheless - with several ongoing issues between recurring characters moved forward (or moved, anyway). I still miss DI Insch, but DI Steel is once again at her entertaining foul-mouthed best, McRae also has more to cope with in terms of his barely-competent colleague 'Beardy' Beattie being promoted to DI ahead of him, and several other colourful characters are also introduced. An entertaining and enjoyable read that isn't quite as brutal as the recent Blind Eye and Flesh House, but still has plenty of MacBride's usual mix of grimness, gore, and guffaws.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLJQ5PQENZJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007362544#wasThisHelpful","RTLJQ5PQENZJU","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long before movies like Shrek or Finding Nemo offered multilayered humour and storylines to entertain children and adults alike, there was Asterix; a vibrant French comic strip that could provoke belly-laughs with its satire and slapstick, while weaving in thoughtful commentary on history, politics, and culture. The fun-filled adventures of a pint-sized Gaul and his friends, with meaning beneath the merriment.Fifty years on from Asterix’s debut in Pilote magazine, this 34th Asterix ‘album’ (only the sixth in the last 20 years) was released as part of the jubilee celebrations. However, those anticipating a brand-new Asterix adventure will be a touch disappointed; this is more a homage to the beloved characters, and the fantastic series. Twelve birthday-related ‘short stories’ show various villagers and guests proposing different ways to celebrate the birthday; everything from Cacofonix’s parodies of famous album covers, to Cleopatra forcing Caesar to provide a gift.It’s fun, but The Golden Book will make you smile rather than laugh out loud; the humour not really matching the layers and high standards of yesteryear (RIP Rene Goscinny) or the continued vibrancy and brilliance of Uderzo’s illustrations. Recommended for longtime Asterix fans and collectors, rather than those wanting the best introduction to the mirth, mischief and magic of the indomitable Gauls.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXF8X1DO17CDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444000950#wasThisHelpful","RXF8X1DO17CDY","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As renowned Master of Wine Bob Campbell says in the introduction to this gorgeous book, “there is a strong connection between scenic splendour and quality wine, and many of New Zealand’s best wines are made in spectacularly beautiful regions”.And who better to capture the visual allure of that connection than Blenheim’s own Kevin Judd? A key figure in the worldwide recognition of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (as Cloudy Bay’s founding winemaker), Judd is also renowned as New Zealand’s finest wine photographer. And it shows, in this stunning tome.Through his lens, Judd takes us on a tour of all of New Zealand’s wine regions, from Northland to Central Otago and all the vine-filled valleys and plains in between. He and Campbell also introduce each region with fascinating details about its history, as well as the climate, topography, and wine styles that make it special.The beautiful landscapes in Marlborough and Nelson are, of course, well-represented in this collection of ‘the best’ of Judd’s vineyard photography. Many of the photos are simply stunning – and a stark reminder that even in this age of digital cameras and photo-sharing image overload thanks to the Internet, there is still something truly special, artistic, and evocative about a superbly-taken photo.Judd particularly shines in highlighting the beauty of the changing seasons and his mastery and use of natural light.

"Amongst the myriad of fond memories from childhood is this: heading down to the local Public Library to excitedly get my hands on a copy of Rhythm and Swing – the great playing days autobiography of my then sporting hero, cricketer Richard Hadlee.Now, a knighthood and twenty years later, Sir Richard has delivered a thoughtful and worthy follow-up with Changing Pace: A Memoir. Picking up where the previous book left off, Sir Richard shares stories, anecdotes and insights from the final years of his playing career, the tumultuous period of his personal life following retirement, his life as a selector, and his thoughts on the evolving state of New Zealand cricket.The sporting recollections and revelations alone make Changing Pace a great read. Sir Richard shares personal insights and opinions on everything from his own playing days to recent events like the Indian Premier League, Stephen Fleming being dropped as captain, and the vitriolic personal criticism he faced from certain sportswriters.But Changing Pace is much more than sporting reminisces; it is also a very personal and candid account of the life of a committed and passionate man, who just happens to be one of the greatest ever at his chosen sport. The first chapter starts not with cricket, but with his grief over the death of his father Walter, three years ago. Sir Richard writes in a very readable and honest style, and there are many moments of both poignancy and humour as he recounts everything from surviving a debilitating heart attack and the disintegration of his marriage of 22 years, to rebuilding his life, and his thoughts on the future of the game he loves.Marketing and reality don’t always go hand in hand, but in this case when the publishers describe Changing Pace as the perfect gift for a sports-loving father, they are absolutely 100% right. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIPYRS78RW3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1869711289#wasThisHelpful","R1HIPYRS78RW3Q","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In A BALI CONSPIRACY MOST FOUL, her second in a series featuring irascible and portly Sikh detective Inspector Singh, Flint sets a murder mystery in the debris and aftermath of the horrific real-life ‘Bali bombings’ that devastated the tourist Mecca several years ago.I quite enjoyed this book, I must say. The characters and setting are fresh and interesting, and Flint writes well. There’s a bit of a dichotomy with Flint’s Inspector Singh novels – the brightly-coloured covers, almost comic or cartoonish main character, and ‘light’ writing style bely the fact that the stories deal with some serious issues, and aren’t in any way bloodless cosys. People are blown up, the detectives examine bits of bullet-holed bone, and not every ‘good guy’ character survives the 292 pages. But it’s still a ‘light’ read, in a good way. Enjoyable, definitely.Inspector Singh is an intriguing main character. A food-loving rotund Singapore policeman of Sikh descent, famous for wearing white sports shoes, he has a good record with murder investigations, but is tolerated rather than liked by his superiors, who are more than happy to send him away to Bali to help with the multi-national investigation into the bombings, despite Singh’s complete lack of terrorism expertise.In A BALI CONSPIRACY MOST FOUL, he finds himself paired up with Bronwyn Taylor, a ‘big-boned’ policewoman of the Australian Federal Police that Singh initially finds annoying and tiresome. Taylor has little experience with murder investigations, but like Singh, she has been somewhat sidelined by her superiors – and her and the pot-bellied Sikh find themselves working together to investigate the bullet-holed bones found at the bombsite. A pair of castaways marooned on a murder case seen as largely insignificant by their respective agencies, who have far more important things on their plate - tracking down the culprits behind the horrific nightclub bombings.Singh is kind of a lovable grump; when he’s not plying himself with nasi goreng and Bintang beer, he can be a sharp and shrewd operator in a murder investigation. He often rubs those around him up the wrong way (sometimes as an intentional tactic, sometimes through indifference), but beneath the gruff and irascible exterior he does have some compassion for the true victims. Unlike Taylor, he doesn’t extend any sympathy to those peripheral victims (eg the murdered man’s wife and friends) that could perhaps have actually been involved in some way, at least until he’s completely ruled them out as suspects.Flint creates a nice tension between Singh and Taylor, a begrudging respect mixed with irritation at the other’s different viewpoints and ways of working. She also evokes the setting of Bali well: its tourist-centric nightspots trying to come to terms with the devastating bombing; its friendly local populace; the split between the lives and perceptions of the ex-pat community and the ‘real’ Bali for the native population; the hustle and bustle; the food, sights, sounds, and smells.Flint also touches on some deeper political and social issues, but not in a heavy-handed way (eg Singh at one point is abused by a grieving Australian, who mistakes the turban-wearing policeman for a Muslim rather than a Sikh)Overall A BALI CONSPIRACY MOST FOUL, with its grumpy hero and vivid setting, is a welcome addition to the crime and mystery genre. It’s an enjoyable story that isn’t a dark or heavy read, but still has some seriousness to it, amongst the lightness and comedic moments. I will definitely read more of Flint’s Inspector Singh tales. I am looking forward to more in the serious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFYUYNKBHPRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312596987#wasThisHelpful","R3VFYUYNKBHPRX","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It can be very tough to keep a long-running series fresh, and avoid slipping into formula. Kathy Reichs has been writing about forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan for more than fifteen years now, and seen her creation gather a legion of fans, and a popular television series.Fortunately, Reichs shows there is still plenty of life in her Temperance Brennan tales, with this latest instalment which finds the forensic anthropologist up to her elbows in murder and intrigue in the lead up to the biggest NASCAR race week of the year.A hand sticking out of a concrete-filled barrel in a landfill neighbouring the Charlotte Motor Speedway is the last thing NASCAR wants, and Brennan finds herself battling on multiple fronts to uncover the truth. A NASCAR crew member shares how twelve years earlier his sister, an aspiring race driver, and her boyfriend (who was tied up with a militant right-wing 'Patriots' group) disappeared. The FBI briefly investigated, then stopped. When the FBI confiscate and cremate the recently discovered body, Brennan wonders what everyone is hiding, and embarks on a twisting trail entangled with murder new and old, race cars, and right wing extremists.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. There are a few differences in this, the fourteenth instalment, which may affect fans differently. It is a very North Carolina-focused tale, unlike the Quebec-based stories or others that bounced around North America earlier in the series. For me, having spent plenty of time in that state, I enjoyed the way Reichs evoked various aspects of life in the American South, including the passion for NASCAR. There is also far less of Temperance's on-again-off-again beau Detective Ryan, and more of a focus on other aspects of Brennan's personal and family life. I thought it worked here, for this book.In FLASH & BONES, Reichs combines her trademark touch for forensic detail, characters and relationships, breezy pacing, and dashes of humour, with a well-evoked setting, giving readers a nice insight into NASCAR – the people, the pageantry, and the passion. It's an easy and enjoyable read, and a notch above the previous instalment MORTAL REMAINS (aka SPIDER BONES).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R378R64T8DHZK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451646690#wasThisHelpful","R378R64T8DHZK1","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"South Africa is definitely gaining in stature on the international crime fiction stage. Deon Meyer has garnered plenty of acclaim, and other authors like Smith and Margie Orford, amongst several others, are certainly putting their local crime fiction on the map.In MIXED BLOOD, reluctant bank robber Jack Burn is on the run after a heist in the United States that left $3 million missing and one cop dead. Hiding out in Cape Town, he is desperate to build a new life for his pregnant wife and young son. But on a tranquil evening in their new suburban neighborhood they are the victims of a random gangland assault that changes everything.Benny Mongrel, an ex-con night watchman guarding a building site next to Burn’s home, is another man desperate to escape his past. After years in the ghetto gangs of Cape Town he knows who went into Burn’s house. And what the American did to them. He also knows his only chance to save his own skin is to forget what he saw. Burn’s actions on that night trap them both in a cat-and-mouse game with Rudi ""Gatsby"" Barnard - a corrupt Afrikaner cop who loves killing almost as much as he loves Jesus Christ - and Disaster Zondi, a fastidious Zulu detective who wishes to settle an old score. Once Gatsby smells those missing American millions, the four men are drawn into a web of murder and vengeance.I really enjoyed MIXED BLOOD. It twists and turns in a violent yet engaging journey that is filled with memorable characters. It's quite dark in parts, but Smith keeps the pace up and his lively prose means it never feels that we're wallowing in that darkness. I'll definitely be reading more of Smith's work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9MU9JBL1CDSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312429509#wasThisHelpful","R9MU9JBL1CDSB","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to crime and thriller writing, there are few bigger names than Michael Connelly – a man critics have called “the greatest living American crime writer”, and the heir to Raymond Chandler. Whether it’s his series featuring LAPD detective Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch or his acclaimed standalones introducing new protagonists, Connelly’s mix of engrossing plots, vividly-drawn characters and well-evoked settings (all sprinkled with wider issues) is loved by readers, critics, and literary awards judges worldwide. Full disclosure: I'm a long-time fan.The fifteenth Bosch novel, Nine Dragons, marks something of a shift in the series; not only is it arguably the most personal storyline yet for the embattled detective, but he also finds himself an ocean away from his LA home, battling to cope in a completely unfamiliar environment.A seemingly straightforward case of an elderly Chinese liquour-store owner gunned down in South LA becomes far more dangerous when Bosch uncovers potential Triad involvement. After ignoring a warning to back off, Bosch receives a chilling message that spurs him to rush to Hong Kong. He’s now got to find not only a killer, but a kidnap victim; his own teenage daughter.I wasn't quite sure what to think of this book. I like some of the freshness Connelly brings to the series, and Nine Dragons is another solid addition to the Connelly canon. Particularly early on, however, some of the dialogue and description fell short of his usual very high standards, and I found myself scratching my head. Things were intriguing and with a good narrative drive, and it was still very enjoyable. However as things move to Hong Kong, Nine Dragons quickly hits its stride and readers will find the pages whirring, and be glad they’re on another enjoyable adventure with one of the best-written detectives of modern times.An ideal summer read, without being the first book in the Bosch series you'd recommend to someone new to Connelly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124WBRAJMYB3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446561959#wasThisHelpful","R124WBRAJMYB3I","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new voice on the Irish crime writing scene, but not a new writer; Casey Hill is a pseudonym for husband-and-wife writing team Melissa and Kevin Hill (Melissa is a bestselling 'contemporary women's lives' novelist).Turning to the dark side with their crime debut, the Hills introduce forensic investigator Reilly Steel, an American who’s moved to Dublin for several reasons: to slow down, drag the Irish crime lab into modernity, and keep an eye on her Irish-born father following a family tragedy.Then a series of brutal deaths intercede; a seeming suicide pact becomes something much worse as more bodies pile up, and it becomes clear a terrible serial killer is on the loose, seeking to highlight the so-called ‘taboos’ that some people may truly live, hidden behind a faade of society’s norms.With any new-to-me writer, I hope to uncover a gem, a voice worth following over many books. In recent years I've struck gold with several debuts from new crime scribes, including Vanda Symon to Stuart MacBride to John Burdett. In each case it was immediately apparent I was in the hands of a talented storyteller with a unique voice who'd created a rich 'world' of characters and setting. There's an electricity beneath the prose, something unseen that elevates standard formulas and structures. Like a musician who has influences, but still brings something fresh and authentically 'them' to their songs and performance.Unfortunately, TABOO disappoints on that front. Many of the pieces that make up the recipe (or sheet music, to continue the analogy) for a great crime novel are there - an interesting heroine with promise, potentially intriguing characters, setting, and crime - but it never really gels for me in terms of those intangibles. It reads a little write-by-numbers, like any originality is outweighed by the influences, so it comes across as a so-so version, an artist mimicking others rather than having yet found their own strong voice. I don't mean to be too harsh, as it's still an okay read - I'm just trying to put my finger on what was lacking.I guess in the end, for me, TABOO doesn’t engage enough to stand out amongst the good and great crime writing that is widely available. Not helped by a weak ending. But Reilly Steel shows enough promise to hope for better next time from Casey Hill.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K3B0R3SGQF34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502836645#wasThisHelpful","R3K3B0R3SGQF34","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Florida, like California, has a strong tradition of crime storytelling, and back in 2002 Jonathon King strengthened the Sunshine State's ranks when he debuted with THE BLUE EDGE OF MIDNIGHT. That novel introduced a fascinating and multi-layered hero, former Philadelphia cop turned private eye Max Freeman. It went on to win the prestigious Edgar Award for best first novel, and kick-started a terrific long-running series.In SHADOW MEN, the third book in the series, Freeman is living in an isolated shack in the Florida Everglades when he's approached - via his good friend Billy Manchester, a lawyer - by the descendant of three men who vanished without a trace while working as labourers on a dangerous road building project 80 years ago. The client has discovered old letters from his ancestor detailing all sorts of injustices and horrors faced by those building the Tamiami Trail through the Everglades, horrors that may have lead to a violent end.King demonstrates a really nice touch for evoking this swampy corner of the world. From the opening chapter, he brings the Everglades vividly to life on the page – the atmosphere, the setting, and the history of an area filled with murky water and even murkier deeds.But SHADOW MEN isn't just a good crime novel with a great character in an intriguing setting: as we follow Freeman on his chase for a truth mixed in history and mystery, larger themes of corporate greed, the strength of family ties, senses of self, and more are all interwoven into the well-crafted tapestry.SHADOW MEN is a fine novel from a fine writer: packed with excitement, color, and memorable, fascinating characters; highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3HQ612Z11JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBPW7H2#wasThisHelpful","RN3HQ612Z11JP","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aussie crime writer Robotham cements his world-class status with this top-shelf geopolitical thriller that's a rollicking taleLuca Terracini is an Iraqi-American journalist living recklessly 'outside the wire' in Baghdad. When he uncovers a billion-dollar bank heist, he's determined to find the money, spurred on by a suicide bombing that killed his true love.As Luca investigates, other lives become entwined with his, and THE WRECKAGE becomes a tale of four people: Luca, willing to risk everything since he's lost everything; UN accountant Daniela Garner, who knows plenty about the heist; a petty thief who stole a notebook from a high-flying banker who might be able to explain where the stolen money has gone, but has since vanished himself; and London ex-copper Vincent Ruiz, who gets scammed.Luca knows there are plenty of dark and shady corners in this war, but as he seeks to uncover the truth of the missing billions, the manhunt for the missing banker leads to Luca being evicted from Iraq and separated from Daniela, putting his investigation in dire jeopardy. As well as his life.In Robotham's seventh and perhaps most ambitious novel, the Australian author eschews his usual style of claustrophobic psychological thrillers to pen a broader story of global intrigue that intersects the war in Iraq and the global financial crisis. And what a fine job he does. For me, this was the best thriller of 2011, an impressive tale that pierces the murk surrounding the billions of dollars being poured into Middle East military operations, and the fear, confusion, and danger around every corner for those there on the ground.THE WRECKAGE crackles with pithy description, insights and observations in throughout its compelling storyline. Various threads entwine secretive powerbrokers in big business and government. Combining the scope of a Tom Clancy novel with a finer balance between character, suspense, and technical detail.This is tense storytelling of the highest order, with an authentic ‘feel’ that grips emotionally as well as intellectually.

"NYPD detective Kat Donovan decides to brave online dating only to stumble across the profile of her ex-fiancée who broke her heart 18 years ago. Reaching out goes badly; he doesn’t seem to remember her, then becomes a suspect in a potential abduction. As Kat digs for the truth she’s consumed by an investigation that threatens all that she’s ever loved and believed.Harlan Coben is one of the true modern masters of twisting tales where ordinary people are caught up in extraordinary events, where sinister machinations and secrets from the past erupt in the present.In MISSING YOU one of the main characters is in fact an NYPD detective, but this story is not so much a classic cop-based crime novel as a thriller where a number of everyday people get caught up in something very dark and dangerous. It’s not her job, but NYPD Detective Kat Donovan’s personal life and her past that pulls her into a troubling situation, when she sees her old fiancée on an online dating site. Over the past 18 years she’s thrown herself into her career, trying to bury multiples hurts and heartbreak deep down. A friend’s pestering gets her to dip her toe into the romantic waters again, but Kat’s past resurfaces in the most bizarre way.At first, Kati is stung when her old fiancée seems cold to her contact. Is she such a distant memory that what they had all those years ago doesn’t matter at all anymore? Then when a young man comes to her saying his mother has gone missing – she was apparently heading away on a romantic holiday with Kat’s ex, having met him on the dating website – the pieces don't quite seem to fit. She needs to know what's going on, but the deeper she digs, the more it seems like the cover stories and obvious realities aren't quite right.Coben spins a gripping yarn, drawing the reader in and making the pages whir as the story twists upon itself and the reader finds themselves face to face with some very very evil people doing some very evil things. There are plotlines and themes both broad and personal as Coben takes us on a heck of a ride. Kat is forced to confront a lot of things she’s put away, and face darker truths about just what happened when her father died and her fiancée vanished all those years ago. Coben does a brilliant job making us care not only about Kat, but many other characters involved in this tale. Characters who are unique, quirky and memorable, while never being caricatures or ciphers. They’re more than their quirks, deeper, and we can connect with their humanity.Coben has set a high standard over the course of his career, and while this book may not reach the peaks of his very best work, it is still an intriguing and enjoyable tale that powers along, inviting the reader to care as we ride along with Kat and the others, prodding our hearts, not just our ‘whose behind this’ curiosity.Chilling and very dark in parts, this is compelling storytelling from a true master.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K7OXMQ095295/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451414128#wasThisHelpful","R1K7OXMQ095295","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Award-winning Auckland cartoonist Ant Sang has now released his first graphic novel; an exciting, modern take on Chinese traditions and kung fu mythology.Shaolin Burning tells the twin stories of Deadly Plum Blossom, a feisty young woman rescued at birth, raised by a Shaolin nun, and trained in a new style of kung fu, and a vengeful former monk who’s cut a swath of destruction across China after escaping the razing of the Shaolin Temple. Deadly Plum Blossom is determined to prove herself, and sets off to challenge the most dangerous foe of all; the former Monk Who Doubts.Sang’s debut novel-length effort is intriguing. His illustrations are stark, violent, and evocative; but a dash of colour instead of greyscale could have raised them to spectacular. Overall the story is an interesting fusion of myth, history, fantasy, and contemporary themes. Tattooed teenaged fighting gangs give a lively feel to old China, although their dialogue ‘clunked’ at times - the author appearing to try too hard for ‘modern’ with ‘bro’ and ‘waste them’ type slang that seems contrived.But overall Shaolin Burning is a well-drawn, page-turning tale that would be an enjoyable read for many.

It is packed with recipes that could become firm favourites for you and your family, regardless of background or religious persuasion. There are lots of pies, and other hearty dishes, from savoury to sweet.At first I was wishing their were more images of some of the meals, photographs and other things to break up the text. But as I read through the recipes I began to appreciate how the stripped-back nature of the collection really worked both thematically and practically.

"What Remains Behind is an archaeological mystery Fowler worked on while completing her Masters in Creative Writing, under literary icon Witi Ihimaera (THE WHALE RIDER)'s tutelage. She was also mentored by award-winning novellist Emily Perkins during the course, which the Waiheke Island resident took after getting hooked on storytelling courtesy of an undergraduate creative writing paper taken as part of completing her degree in archaeology as a mature student.Fowler’s debut combines her twin passions, centering as it does on a dig near a small rural town in the Kaipara. Chloe Davis is a contract archaeologist who has returned to her family-owned farm to excavate, before the farm is subdivided for lifestyle blocks, the ruins of a religious community that burned to the ground in the 1880s, killing several people. Already under time and budget pressure, Chloe and her team soon encounter local resistance, ranging from bar fights to sabotage and vandalism. Is someone worried that uncovering the past could upset the present? Chloe’s life and work is further complicated by the unknown motives of old acquaintances and interfering relatives.The story switches regularly between Chloe’s present-day narration, and journal entries made by Charity, a young girl living in the isolated religious community in the lead-up to the tragedy. It’s a literary structure that could flourish or fall flat, but overall Fowler does a very good job, utilising the linked but 120-years-apart storylines to collectively build towards her novel’s denouement. Each has its own voice and language, different enough to seem authentic, without being overdone.Fowler also creates a nice sense of authenticity with the small-town setting, filled with the spider-web of shared histories, and secrets past or present, that can be prevalent in a place where everyone knows everyone (or at least presumes they do). Fowler also shines with bringing the reader into the world of archaeology, striking a balance between enough details to fascinate and ring true, without overwhelming with technical jargon.Depending on what sort of mysteries readers are used to, some may struggle with the slower pacing in the early part of the novel; Fowler employs a slow burn, with events unfolding leisurely until the final third of the novel. There’s a growing sense that something is not quite right with the excavation and the nearby town, rather than any sort of focused investigation being sparked by an early hook or crime.Beyond the alternating narratives, the impact of history on the present is also a wider theme in What Remains Behind. Fowler weaves the colonial and more recent past into the fabric of the story, and things are brought together very well, and not in an entirely predictable way, in the latter stages. Overall, an enjoyable read and a promising debut from a new voice in New Zealand writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NFBFDYVXSWMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007U7TLHO#wasThisHelpful","R1NFBFDYVXSWMN","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five years before STANDING IN ANOTHER MAN'S GRAVE, Ian Rankin rocked the crime fiction world by retiring, to howls of protest, one of the most popular characters in the history of crime writing: anarchic yet noble Detective Inspector John Rebus of the Lothian and Borders Police. Readers around the world were devastated.Rankin had always said Rebus would age in real-time, so when the copper reached retirement age, he retired. Such was the outcry that there were even talks in the Scottish Parliament to up the police’s retirement age, so Rebus could return to the beat.But now Rebus is back, as part of a team of retired detectives who sift through cold cases, hoping to find something long overlooked. He's tempted by a return to CID duties, thanks to a rise in the official retirement age (mirroring real life, Rankin inspired or not). But does the police force, especially DI Malcolm Fox of Internal Affairs, want the maverick copper back?In Rebus’s absence, Fox has become the central figure in Rankin’s tales, starring in two very good crime novels. He’s the anti-Rebus, a straight man who upholds the system rather than giving it the proverbial middle finger. Intriguing in a completely different way.While delving into a series of seemingly unrelated disappearances dating back more than a decade, Rebus stubbornly continues to put himself, and those around him, in jeopardy.Sparks certainly fly in STANDING IN ANOTHER MAN'S GRAVE - not just between Rankin's two series heroes, Rebus and Fox, but also Rebus and plenty of other people. Series favourites like Siobhan Clarke and Ger Cafferty feature strongly in this page-turning story that also muses on the passing of time and an ever-changing world. The world is shifting, will Rebus too?A cracking crime novel that demonstrates Rankin is still very much at the top of his game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PHCSXGM49L6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031622460X#wasThisHelpful","R3PHCSXGM49L6D","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not just for her two eyes of different colours. Although they played a part in the twists her life took.Years ago Lex was Milena, a young girl in Olissa, a state that has been battled over by the Russians, Iran, America and others. Recruited to Perun, a training academy for spies, she was groomed as a sleeper agent, indoctrinated to the quest for Olissian independence, then inserted into her mission: replacing the real Lex Gladstone, who died in a tragic car crash with her parents. Milena/Lex is raised by Albert, her American grandfather, who himself works for the CIA. She doesn't know when she will be called on to activate and undertake a mission. Until then, she's a regular American teenage girl. Even if she keeps everyone at distance.Then she gets her mission, to assassinate the US-friendly President of Olissa, and pin the blame on her grandfather.TA MacLagan weaves a page-turning tale, that is slickly written, and full of intrigue both in terms of the twisting plotline, and the character of Lex herself. An accomplished and highly trained young woman who battles with herself and where she fits, just like any teenager. Who tries to find a balance between her mission and her life.There are some echoes of the likes of THE HUNGER GAMES, with its intriguing and kickass heroine up against the world, making choices that affect her and others' lives, and fans of that series may easily be hooked by the adventures of Alexandra Gastone. But TA MacLagan also brings something fresh in her storytelling. A great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYN2RVFLG36H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633700607#wasThisHelpful","R2OYN2RVFLG36H","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Died in the Wool is one of four Alleyn tales Marsh set in her native New Zealand, and is made even more interesting as it was actually published during the Second World War, and incorporates aspects, issues, and perspectives on the war climate into the murder mystery plotline. Being written before Marsh would have even known when or how the war would end, some of the settings and characterisations can give insights into New Zealand at that time that no recently written historical novel, no matter how well researched, can match.One summer evening in 1942, formidable Member of Parliament Florence “Flossie” Rubrick goes to the wool shed on her high country property to rehearse a patriotic speech, and disappears. Three weeks later, she’s found – dead inside a bale of wool at an auction. Inspector Alleyn, in New Zealand on war security matters, comes to the high country sheep station more than a year later, after Rubrick’s husband has also passed away from illness, and tries to piece together what really happened to the polarising MP, based on the testimonies of several acquaintances. At the same time, concerns are raised about the top-secret security work being carried out by two young men – have the blueprints for the new anti-aircraft device been leaked?In effect, Marsh has transported the classic British ‘country house’ murder mystery, with its closed environment and small amount of characters – all of whom have a motive for killing the victim, into a rural New Zealand setting during the war. But she also does a few things differently that help Died in the Wool stand out. Alleyn arrives months after the murder, so can’t rely on the crime scene clues and observations usually available to detectives – instead he has to weigh the differing recollections of the residents (each has its own chapter, eg “According to Terence Lynne”). This device gave Marsh not only a different structure and investigative method, but the opportunity to ‘voice’ varying views and concerns about what was going on during the war, through her different characters.In general, Marsh’s plots weren’t quite as intricate as Christie’s puzzles, but she was the superior writer when it came to setting, description, and giving her characters more depth and layers. Compared to today’s crime novels, the pace is somewhat languid, and at times, the language used dates the book, but decades after it was published, Died in the Wool remains an absorbing, enjoyable read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPA7T0M7E3XC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193738456X#wasThisHelpful","R3NPA7T0M7E3XC","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An enthralling instalment in the doyenne of Tartan Noir's popular Tony Hill and Carol Jordan series sees a malevolent old foe creating havoc for the fragile harmony between our heroes.Val McDermid writes some outstanding standalone thrillers, but for many fans it is her series starring dysfunctional criminal psychologist Dr Tony Hill and ambitious and gutsy DCI Carol Jordan that is most eagerly anticipated. The pairing, further popularised by the Wire in the Blood television series adapted from McDermid's books (which starred Robson Green as Hill), have a pretty unique and unusual relationship in terms of crime fiction duos.Dr Hill is a socially awkward man carrying the scars of emotional abuse received as a child, but he has a brilliant mind and keen insight into the darkness in serial killers' souls. His ability to understand the worst of the worst enables him to hunt them down. Although there is a professional and personal connection between himself and Jordan, he's long resisted any romantic entanglement. They've lived in the same house, but aren't partners. They're closer than friends, without crossing a physical line.While RETRIBUTION is McDermid's 25th crime novel, it is only the seventh in her popular Hill and Jordan series, and it contains plenty of fodder to stir the passions of long-time fans, for good or bad. For not only do Hill and Jordan return, but so does notorious celebrity TV host turned serial killer Jacko Vance.Vance was the arch-nemesis from WIRE IN THE BLOOD, the second book in the series. And now, just as Hill and Jordan have found some measure of harmony in their relationship and thoughts of taking themselves to another place, professionally and perhaps even personally, Vance escapes from prison. After years behind bars he's out for vengeance, and throws their lives, and those of their colleagues, into disarray.Vance matches Hill in cleverness and wits, and has a charm that the profiler could never attain. Convicted of the murder of one teenage girl, Hill and Jordan know in their bones Vance has many more bodies on his resume, including a colleague, and that he'll stop at nothing to get whatever it is he wants. He simply doesn't see anything wrong in what he does. Given Hill and Jordan played a big part in putting him behind bars more than a decade ago, his escape casts a long and sinister shadow over their lives. Meanwhile, Jordan's team is investigating another serial killer who is on the loose in Bradfield, killing prostitutes.The twin investigations in THE RETRIBUTION make for an intriguing read. Vance is such a fascinating antagonist that we can be left wanting more of his scenes, but at the same time by drip-feeding them to us while Jordan's team is allowed to shine chasing another killer, McDermid creates an interesting tension. I found the book quite propulsive overall, and McDermid has crafted another pulse-pounding storyline that generates a visceral not just cerebral reaction, but for me her writing shines brightest in the emotional turmoil of her characters' relationships. She takes Hill and Jordan to some places that may dismay some long-time fans, who perhaps feel an ownership over their favourites (as you often see with TV viewers being upset where the writers take 'their' characters in later series), but for me things worked pretty well overall.A slick, pacy read that provides plenty of entertainment, featuring one of the better villains in British crime fiction, and leaving the future of many characters completely up in the air, professionally and personally.This book was originally reviewed for Crime Watch: www.kiwicrime.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXSFD9HMAASBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080212044X#wasThisHelpful","RXSFD9HMAASBY","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A disappointing tale that has some good murder mystery pieces, but is very poorly put together.The heiress to a New Zealand business empire is climbing in the Himalaya with a group of friends and family members, when she falls to her death off the side of a mountain. A New Zealand detective is vacationing nearby, after a fall-out with his superiors back home, and is pulled into the case by Nepalese counterparts, interviewing each member of the party to determine who might have had the means and motive for the killing.It's not a bad set-up, with an interesting setting, and plenty of classic traits of an old-fashioned murder mystery (pool of suspects, isolated crime scene, lots of motives and secrets, a few clues, intertwining relationships etc), but unfortunately the author fails to bring it together  well. The most disappointing aspect of the short book (25 pages) is the writing itself. It reads very clunky, with lots of poor phrasing, repetition, and just flat-out strange ways of putting things. At first I thought it just needed a good editor to significantly tidy it up - it reads like a min-dump unedted first draft or synopsis - but then I began to wonder if the author was actually not an English speaker, given the way some things were put. It does read a lot like a Google translation from another language.The characters in the party have promise, but in such a short book are a little cipher-ish in nature. Their interactions with the New Zealand detective are pretty straightforward, and there is plenty of expository dialogue. It was a nice nod to Everest history to have characters called Hillary, Mallory, George, and Edmund (one for the history buffs). After interviewing each suspect and examining some evidence found on the body, the detective rushes to the airport to prevent the party leaving, before gathering them all in a room to reveal the killer. All very classic cosy mystery.Unfortunately, here yet again the writer drops the ball - the eventual unveiling has some interesting background, but none of that was ever hinted, even in a much-hidden way, to the reader. The detective does things off screen we never hear about, even in an aside or briefly mentioned way, and makes conclusions about evidence the reader wasn't allowed to see or deduce, because the writer never shared any of that information.So it's a big fail on the fairplay stakes too.Overall this book reads like the author is a fan of mysteries, and has created some pieces with potential, or a rough blueprint, for their own tale based on that understanding. But the execution has let down the idea, the pieces haven't been put together at all well,To crime readers, I'd say don't bother with this book at all. To the author, consider a rewrite and some editing - there are some gold flakes amongst this slurry, it just needs a bit more work to bring them to the fore. Right now, feeling generous, I'd give it 1.5 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RW5A4DPJKF2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157N46I6#wasThisHelpful","R2RW5A4DPJKF2H","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A cracking debut that introduces intriguing young Alabama detective Carson Ryder, and launches a superb series set in the sweltering South.There's something special, and fun, about absorbing the first raw notes of a new crime fiction voice, crossing fingers and hoping to uncover a gem of an author, and perhaps a character worth following through books and years to come.One of the finest debuts I've read in the past few years is advertiser-turned-author Jack Kerley's first Carson Ryder tale, THE HUNDREDTH MAN. It's the type of book that has a distinct style and voice, a twist on standard tropes, delivering a fresh take in a crowded genre that made me want to go and read more of Kerley's work (I discovered this book when Kerley had already published a few novels, and in fact I was inspired to go and buy and read all of them in the following couple of months).For me, THE HUNDREDTH MAN earned Kerley a rare, immediate elevation to 'must read' author status.Kerley’s debut tale hits like a hammer right from the opening pages, quickly moving from missing fingers to missing heads, all in the sweltering heat of Mobile, Alabama. Two headless bodies scrawled in barely decipherable ranting spark junior detective Carson Ryder (something of a young upstart) and veteran partner Harry Nautilus onto the trail of another serial killer, one that dredges up past secrets for many people, including Ryder himself. He's forced to do something he doesn't want to, as he's trying to further establish his career. Ryder and Nautilus are the Mobile Police Deparment’s Psychopathological and Sociopathological Investigative Team (PSIT), which is dismissively called “Piss-it” by other police colleagues.Ryder is a fascinating character - both admired and loathed by colleagues and superiors, having hitched onto the fast-track following a successful serial killer pursuit the year before – seemingly thanks to Ryder’s innate understanding of “crazies and freaks”. The thing is, Ryder has a secretive ace up his sleeve, or perhaps more of a wildcard: his brother Jeremy, an incarcerated serial killer. Ryder has done a lot over the years, including changing his name, to hide this part of his past, but sociopathic Jeremy helped Ryder on the case that helped kickstart his promising career, leading to plenty of internal and external tension for the young detective.The whole serial killer helping an investigator trope isn't that unique in crime fiction, but Kerley brings a fresh take to it, not just because of the familial relationship, but the well-drawn characters of Ryder and Jeremy. The relationship between the brothers, as well as Ryder's conflicted feelings about his sibling, add extra layers to what is a well-plotted and exciting book, storyline-wise.There are some great possibilities to see how things might evolve both with the character of Ryder, and his relationship with Jeremy, over the course of more than one book (that did prove to be the case). Jeremy is one of the most fascinating 'villains' I've read in any book series in a long time.Detective Carson Ryder is a little different to the typical detective, although exhibits some classic traits: doggedness, courage, a murky past (despite his youth) that created ongoing issues to deal with, etc. For me, the best storytelling strikes a balance between the familiar and the unique, and matches engaging characters with exciting plots and well-drawn settings.In THE HUNDREDTH MAN, Kerley’s writing puts a huge tick in all boxes, but more importantly, brings everything together into a gripping tale unfolding naturally from the characters, backstory, and setting – never feeling forced by an authorial puppet-master. It was a gem uncovered, and made me want to read more.This review was written for and first published on Crime Watch: http://kiwicrime.blogspot.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ICL8YW2A25F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007342292#wasThisHelpful","R19ICL8YW2A25F","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The seventh book in the Lake District Mysteries demonstrates Martin Edwards is a very fine writer of contemporary crime.I first came across Edwards a few years ago in relation to his CWA short story anthologies, mystery criticism, and encyclopaedic knowledge of the crime genre. Most recently, he's been involved with resurrecting forgotten classics and an outstanding, authoritative tome, THE GOLDEN AGE OF MURDER. But solicitor by day, writer by night Edwards has also penned many modern mysteries set in the north of England (the Harry Devlin series and the Lake District Mysteries).Not that there isn't some history to this modern-day mystery. DCI Hannah Scarlett returns to the fore, as she and her cold case team re-investigate the three-year-old disappearance of a young woman when another local teenager vanishes. A coincidental, perhaps disturbing, wrinkle for the police is the fact the fathers of both girls are connected by an historic and horrific murder spree.Twenty years earlier, the owner of 'the Dungeon House' manor went on a drink and jealousy-fuelled rampage, slaughtering his wife and daughter, then killing himself. Both men with missing daughters were at the party the tragic family had held on their property earlier that day (one, a relative, lives there now), as was Hannah's old boss and mentor, Ben Kind. When the ex-girlfriend of one of the fathers returns to the tiny village on Cumbria's wild west coast, all sorts of secrets being boiling dangerously to the surface.The Dungeon House is an impeccably plotted tale where Edwards vividly brings the picturesque national park region in the north of England to vivid life. He adroitly conjures rural, small-town life, with its dichotomy of surface inter-connectedness and hidden secrets. Everyone feels they know everyone, but knowing this, the locals also keep things hidden from their close neighbours. Let alone outsiders. I've not yet visited the Lake District, but Edward's descriptions brought it's rugged beauty to life for me. The combination of harsh nature, pleasant countryside, and small-town commerce all threads throughout an absorbing mystery tale.The main characters - from Hannah and her team, to historian Daniel Kind (Ben's son and Hannah's lover) and returning Joanna Footit, who sparks more chaos as she reminds people of things they'd rather forget - are all well-drawn and brought to life. Likewise, Edwards does a good job creating a memorable broader cast to his mystery, from eccentric locals to victims and perpetrators alike. The real-life lawyer has a canny ear for vernacular and perspective, subtly showing how people see the same events differently, without resorting to unreliable narrator tropes.A very fine mystery that delves into the darkness and doubts that tickle all of our souls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R180DAS13KE4WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464203202#wasThisHelpful","R180DAS13KE4WH","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Through the keyhole of a door-bolted wine cellar in a country estate, a man is seen sprawled. Dead, not drunken. After the hinges are removed and death confirmed, many in the gathered gathered crowd assume heart attack, only for the doctor to later proffer poisoning, kick-starting an unwanted police investigation.A locked room mystery in a country manor? It sounds like the start of a classic Agatha Christie or Ngaio Marsh mystery from the Golden Age, but in reality this is the set-up for a delightful tale from a modern-day Italian crime writer - although it is set in 1890s Tuscany.Elderly merchant Pellegrino Artusi, a famed writer of cookery books, is one of two guests invited to visit a Baron's castle in Tuscany for a boar hunt and a few days relaxation (the other is a photographer). Artusi, who has travelled far and wide throughout nineteenth century Italy sampling cuisine for his tome The Science of Cooking and The Art of Eating Well, is keen to learn the secrets of the Baron's kitchen.Instead finds himself caught up in a troubling murder mystery when the Baron's young butler is found dead in the cellar beside a port wine glass. The arrival of a policeman puts everyone on edge, and fingers are pointed in various directions by the Baron's spoiled and lazy sons - one a lothario, the other dreams or being a famous poet - including towards Artusi himself. Then someone tries to shoot the Baron on a boar hunt, and Artusi must use his own highly attuned senses to uncover who's the true cause of all the violence.THE ART OF KILLING WELL is a deliciously enjoyable tale - moreish without leaving you feeling overstuffed. It's relatively short, at less than 200 pages, and is a smooth, smile-inducing read. Malvaldi peppers the story with plenty of mischievousness; it's almost like the author and narrator both have a wee smirk on their face throughout. The setting in nineteenth century Tuscany adds some extra flavour: Italy has just been unified, and all the regional and class prejudices are on show as the characters are coming to grip with the changing face of a modernising nation. It was a time where the old pastoral fiefdoms were mixing with the increasing industrialisation of the world, changing work and leisure for everybody.Malvaldi manages to craft a story that follows the classic cosy murder mystery recipe while also sprinkling something fresh and tasty for modern readers. There's an eclectic cast of memorable characters ensconsced at the castle, from the boorish libertine Gaddo to a dog-loving elderly Signorina who sees potential husbands at every turn, and Malvaldi provides plenty of suspects, red herrings, and twists to the murderous dish.A very enjoyable read from a talented writer.This review was written for Crime Watch: http://kiwicrime.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/review-art-of-killing-well-by-marco.html","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKDFFKPZVMQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782067809#wasThisHelpful","R1FKDFFKPZVMQF","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot to like about this novel, which creeps up on you in its storytelling. Ward does a terrific job evoking the environment and daily life of the ruggedly beautiful Peak District, as well as creating a beguiling cast of characters who manage to seem fresh even if on the surface they conform to classic crime fiction tropes.DC Connie Childs is an ambitious young cop on the rise, itching for action and advancement in a quieter corner of Britain. DI Frank Sadler is her more reserved superior. Superintendent Llewellyn was a fresh-faced constable on the 1978 kidnapping case, and is troubled by Yvonne Jenkins' suicide. He asks Sadler and his team to take another look at the original crime, to see if modern police methods can help shed new light on the oh-so-cold case. The spirited Childs is pleased for the chance to shine while her colleague-rival junior detective is distracted by the stresses of his upcoming nuptials.Meanwhile, Rachel Jones finds her own past brought painfully back to light: she was the girl that was found. It's an incident that's affected her in a myriad of ways ever since, even though she claims to have no memory of the events. She recovered from the kidnapping thanks to her strong-willed mother and grandmother, and is now a genealogist who specialises in the matriarchal lines of family histories. While Rachel fears the media frenzy once the press links the suicide to the old tragedy, when one of her former teachers is strangled a few days later, she realises that Pandora's Box has been opened, dark secrets are seeping out, and she'll have to take steps to protect herself while trying to work out what really happened.Jones and Childs/Sadler investigate the past and present in separate and inter-linked ways, building to a thrilling conclusion as the disturbing truth is uncovered, and the guilty parties are backed into a corner.This is a very female centric mystery novel. Two girls are kidnapped, by a woman. The case is resurrected due to the suicide of one woman, then the murder of another. The two main leads are female: a policewoman battling for her place in a still male-dominated world, and a middle-aged history-buff who was raised by a woman with a deep suspicion of men, and now researches and shares the forgotten stories of women in her genealogy clients' family histories. But as a male crime fiction reader, I really liked it.Ward does a great job of evoking many issues faced by woman, historic and contemporary, without painting the male characters as caricatures (which I've seen in other such novels) or paper-thin pieces just there to play antagonist or make a political or social point. The rivalry and collegiality between Childs and her fellow DC feels authentic and multi-layered. The relationships between Childs and Sadler and Llewellyn, or Jones and other characters, likewise feel very real. Ward inserts little touches and complexities that mirror real-life into all the working, personal, and other relationships, giving them a fuller feel.A strong theme of family history, and questions about how best to deal with troubling situations from the past, runs throughout IN BITTER CHILL. Thematically, Ward nicely balances provoking questions in the readers' mind while not getting up on a soapbox or delivering clear-cut answers. Accordingly many of those issues and questions enjoyably linger after the storyline itself is wrapped up in the final pages.Overall, I was very impressed with this first effort from Sarah Ward. IN BITTER CHILL is like a modern take on the classic British village mystery, evoking those Golden Age trends of puzzling plots in picturesque countryside settings, delving into dark issues and secrets without being gritty or graphically violent.I look forward to more from DC Childs, DI Sadler, and this talented author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEIJ65XWK836/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDE2LNU#wasThisHelpful","RNEIJ65XWK836","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB by David Lagercrantz, translated by George Goulding (MacLehose Press, 27 August 2015)Reviewed by Craig SistersonShe's back. After all the waiting, anticipation, and controversy, Lisbeth Salander is back.It starts with a hand, beating rhythmically on a mattress in an unknown bedroom. Why is the hand beating? Whose hand is it? Whose bedroom? What does it mean?None of those questions are answered until much later in THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB, and by then David Lagercrantz has taken readers on a heck of an absorbing ride.Let's address the elephant in the room: not everyone will be happy with this novel. Many people in the books world seem to have decided to avoid it or dislike it on principle: that no-one should continue Stieg Larsson's series, the three books of an intended ten that he'd written but never published before his heart attack.But those who approach THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB with at least a partially open mind will find themselves pleasantly surprised; it's a very good book. It's terrific to see Salander, who is much more than an antisocial goth hacker, back fighting against injustice in a new adventure. In her own inimitable way.Undoubtedly the creation of Salander was Stieg Larsson's greatest genius in his initial trilogy: while his tales were swirling epics addressing some dark issues simmering below the seemingly perfect surface of Scandinavian society, Salander was the lightning rod that elevated the stories into something more.In THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB Lagercrantz does a fantastic job at delving deeper into Lisbeth Salander, offering readers more of an insight into this 'grown up version of Pippi Longstocking' (as Larsson considered her). Lagercrantz treads the fine line between providing more texture about an enigmatic character, without losing the mystery and uncertainty that makes them so compelling in the first place.Salander is the kind of iconic character who doesn't even need to be in the room to have a presence. Like James Bond, Zorro, Robin Hood, or Sherlock Holmes, she casts a shadow over a wider world, lingering in the minds and hearts of those she's touched, friends and foes alike.Early on in THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB, Mikael Blomkvist is battling against money-driven evisceration of Millennium, the magazine he loves, when he meets a potential source in a bar to discuss a story tip. Things are stock-standard, and Blomkvist's eyes are glazing as he listens to chat about technology and corporate espionage, when he - and the reader - is suddenly electrified by the passing mention of a female hacker. From there, the story becomes much more interesting, for Blomkvist and the reader.As Blomkvist delves deeper, the story gets bigger and bigger. A world-renowned Swedish computer scientist, a verifiable genius, has seemingly abandoned his work and boarded himself up in his home. He wants to talk to Blomkvist, but is attacked before they can meet. His work has disappeared, and the only witness is an autistic child, who now becomes the target of a shadowy criminal organisation.Lagercrantz does well juggling all the players in this tale, from the driven staff of the NSA, who see spying on everyone as the way to protect their country's interests, to Eastern European gangsters, Swedish authorities, and dangerous figures from Salander's own past. While Salander and Blomkvist are the stars, there is a broad cast of fascinating characters who add texture and intrigue - and Lagercrantz does an elegant job keeping THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB building then racing along rather than becoming convoluted.For those who love Scandinavian crime for the way it delves into social and personal issues, there is plenty of that on offer in the fourth Salander book, from issues of privacy, what the public is entitled to know, to the various ways technology can be used and abused, the changing face of the media, and much more.For me however, it is the evocation of Salander, who is one of the finest characters created in contemporary fiction, which is the real highlight of THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB. Much like Christopher Nolan did with his tremendous re-imagining of Batman, Lagercrantz delves deeper into Lisbeth while keeping her very much who she is. We see more and understand more, but remain fascinated, intrigued, and unsure.And when the final page came, I was no longer doubtful of whether the books should be continued or not. In fact, I am very much hoping that we will see more from Lagercrantz, Blomkvist and Salander in future.This review was first published on the Crime Watch website: http://kiwicrime.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/review-girl-in-spiders-web.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HF0XG7DV0LB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJPZCWE#wasThisHelpful","R3HF0XG7DV0LB2","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second instalment in British author Woodhouse's 'Amsterdam Quartet' is a very fine European police thriller, with a twisting plotline and intriguing cast of characters.A headless body is found on an Amsterdam rooftop, hands blow-torched. Torture, or is the killer trying to slow down identification. Inspector Jaap Rykel then finds something even more chilling: his own image on the victim's phone. What's going on? Then the killer publicises another headless body. Meanwhile a homeless woman is pushed in front of a train, and some of Jaap's closest colleagues are dealing with personal strife. Troubles they're keeping from everyone, even Jaap.Woodhouse crafts an enthralling tale, with a plotline that encompasses violent murder, war crimes tribunals, the drugs trade, kidnapping, and more. Although there are some brutal moments, it never feels gratuitous - Woodhouse defly treads the line between darkness and dirge. While the storyline is fascinating, perhaps the greatest accomplishment is Woodhouse's creation of a police squad that includes many of the clashes, tensions, and pressures you'd expect to see in crime drama, but still manages to feel fresh and not cliched.Amsterdam cops Jaap, Tanya, Kees and Smit all seem like fully-formed people, not caricatures or moving pieces for the plot. Other, including Jaap's ex Saskia, a war crimes prosecutor, and drug squad cops and villains are also given moments to shine, and not just be wallpaper.It's all plotted so smoothly that you don't see the author's hand. Overall this is a very fine thriller, with an absolute gut punch of an ending that leaves you wondering where Woodhouse will take Jaap and those close to him next. And keen to find out. Bring on book three.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQBUIRDEC0GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405914319#wasThisHelpful","R3QQBUIRDEC0GQ","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this book made me grin. It's probably a little too old for my daugher right now, but I know she will love it later on. Foster is a very smart kid who always wants to know why. He asks the big questions that his parents tell him nobody knows the answers to.

"An outstanding book for children (that adults can also get a lot from), delightfully illustrated, presenting the story of an amazing man, George Moses Horton. With words and pictures Don Tate takes us through the story of George's remarkable life, where his strong spirit and love for language helped him grow from an illiterate slave boy working the fields to an extraordinary and important voice in America's literary and poetic history. This book is everything that children's books should be - easy to read, pleasant to look at, telling a great tale that leaves parent and child both feeling inspired, pleased, and knowing something more about our world. Thank you Don Tate","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DW8CD4A1L4RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561458252#wasThisHelpful","R2DW8CD4A1L4RC","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ulie Thomas proves she has a deft hand for multiple genres as she switches from historical romance and spins an intriguing yarn in this, her first crime thriller. Described as ""blackly comic"", it's certainly a tale with moments that are dark and light, although ""comic"" is a stretch. Vinnie Whitney-Ross has found middle-aged bliss as a Waiheke Island winemaker married to his chocolatier sweetheart, an idyll a world away from his former life on the periphery of one of London's most psychotic gangland families. But his Kiwi dream was bought with the betrayal of a childhood pal who won't forgive or forget, and soon Vinnie faces a collision between lives old and new. Thomas skilfully evokes the gritty violence of Vinnie's East End life before switching gears as he moves from small-time hood to loved-up wine merchant. More a mixed case of quality quaffables than a Petrus, this is an enjoyable and easy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F71Y63QKXMAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0CQKU8#wasThisHelpful","R3F71Y63QKXMAH","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best debut crime/thriller novels I've read in the past decade. Hamilton crafts an excellent page-turner which intrigues as much through his characters as the gripping plotlines.Van Shaw, a wounded Army Ranger who grew up as a childhood thief, appeals as a multi-layered protagonist with the potential to be the spine of an ongoing series. In this first book, he finds himself back in his hometown of Seattle after a decade away, visiting his estranged grandfather following a cryptic message, only to find the old man - who'd raised him - bloodied and shot on the floor. Shaw must navigate a minefield of police, his military masters, his past associates, and an unknown killer as he seeks to find the truth before his Army leave is over.Hamilton writes with remarkable assuredness for a debutant, balancing action, storyline, intrigue, character, and setting in a way reminiscent of the best crime writers out there. PAST CRIMES has all the hallmarks of a page-whirring thriller, balanced with depth of character for those who prefer their crime and thrills of a more substantive nature.In the end, with a debut author, the biggest question is 'would I read more of this writer'? In the case of Glen Erik Hamilton and PAST CRIMES, my answer would be: ""in a heartbeat"". Looking forward to Book #2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1389JNE16YN9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062344552#wasThisHelpful","R1389JNE16YN9A","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glaswegian author Michael J. Malone's prose is onyx; unique and glittering in its darkness. While journalism is a common background for crime writers, Malone has 200 published poems to his name, and that rare talent for language bleeds into his storytelling in this noir-ish tale.Kenny O'Neill is both hero and villain; a likeable criminal at the core of this exquisite thriller. A Glaswegian gangster capable of brutality, but with a degree of heart and (sort-of) moral compass, whose rage powers a fascinating thrill-ride into the underbelly of Scotland.Kenny has every right to be angry. His father abandoned him after his mother's suicide, yet is now reaching out years later, while at the same time his girlfriend - a high-class hooker - has been viciously attacked. Balancing white knight and black hat, Kenny is driven to try to solve the mysteries of the past and the present, quick-stepping through a minefield of dangers as he seeks answers, and vengeance.Malone does a tremendous job at crafting a novel with a dark heart, yet peppered with moments of humour and plenty of things that can make readers grin, even laugh. Kenny is Tony Soprano-esque, in that he's a bad guy, but also incredibly fascinating, layered, and you just can't help but root for him on his quest. There's an intriguing cast of characters that orbit around Kenny's life too, from the high to the low in Glaswegian society, wannabe tough-guys to aging mentors and dangerous monied men. Malone infuses them all with some nuance - there are no cardboard cut-outs or caricatures here. People want things, for very human reasons.BEYOND THE RAGE has a twisting plotline that will thrill crime fans, keeping the reader guessing as events unfold, while delivering depth of character and stylish prose that elevates it to the higher echelons of the genre. Just a damned good story. Dark, absorbing, filled with ferocity and feeling.Delightful seems a bizarre word to use for such a noir tale, full of unsympathetic people, but delighted I was as I was carried along by Malone's craftsmanship, the words crackling with intensity, pages filled with spark.A violent and visceral read from a master storyteller. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IDPV09QCH1RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908643706#wasThisHelpful","R3IDPV09QCH1RA","A4JE9OK3BEVJI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JE9OK3BEVJI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have waist long hair, and keeping it tangle free is possible, but only if I want to take half of my hair with it. Even when it feels tangle free, it's not. I have problem areas where I get tight knots close to my scalp in the back of my head. This brush does not break my hair, pull my hair, or rip my hair out of my head. It truly detangles hair and it's amazing. The other thing that I *love* about this brush is how easy it is to wash it when you inevidently get oils and whatnot from your head.

"Stencil is made very well. They work great with a variety of mediums. I use this stencil/mask with inks like Ranger DYC-33844 Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Collection Ink Spray, Bubblegum Pink and Ranger DYC-33899 Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Collection Ink Spray, London Blue 2 fl. oz. Another great medium to use this with acrylic paint.  There are so many other mediums to use this with, even as basic as pen and pencil, outlining outside/inside of this stencil and doodling inside it.Pro Tip:Use good, sharp scissors like Tonic Studios Tim Holtz 817 Kushgrip Non Stick Micro Serrated Snips, 7"" to carefully free the inside mask from the outside stencil. Try not to fold because if you're not careful, you run the risk of accidentally putting a bend mark on the stencil/mask that you can't undo. Just be careful and you should be fine.To keep tract of the inside masks, I use a ziplock bag and a paperclip to keep the two together.I also use an expanding bill file to keep track of my stencils. The other ""people"" stencils in this line (Ranger Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Stencils, 9 by 12-Inch, Ruby) will get tangled up in each other so I put them in separate pockets from each other, with their matching masks, of course.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBT4MN41QX7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFHRHVM#wasThisHelpful","R3CBT4MN41QX7N","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spray does have gloss to it. I probably used about 6 or 7 coats on a canvas; I've never used any kind of protective spray before so I didn't quite know what to expect or what the magic number of coats was, if any.  I followed the instructions on the can, and put on another coat every 15 minutes.I don't know how many coats it would have taken, but the number of coats I applied seems to seal the water based inks I use  (Dylusions, for example Ranger Dyan Reaveley Dylusions Collection Ink Spray, Cherry Pie).  I've been searching on what I can use to seal the (reactive with water) Dylusions ink sprays for a while.  I waited 24 hours, then I sprinkled some water on top of my canvas to see how it held up, and the results are positive, it repelled the water.Pro Tip:Get a feel for the spray by spraying on something that is not your project first, or on an inconspicuous area.Start by spraying off of the project so that you don't have edges of your project non-coated, and off of your project for the same reason.Be patient.If at all possible, use this outside.  I did, and the fumes still followed me into my house even though I had the glass door closed. For example, I went outside, closed the sliding glass door, sprayed a coat, opened my sliding glass door and shut it behind me really fast and it still smelled like chemicals, and none of it was on my clothes.  If you must do this indoors, make sure that your area is WELL VENTILATED.  Well ventilated doesn't just mean just an open window either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKST04ZHSLW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001K65K26#wasThisHelpful","R1KKST04ZHSLW4","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to get this because it's in book form, and if I get bored doing one, I can always do another one in the book.  I wanted to know what each of the pictures were before I bought them, and as of today (3/1/15) there aren't any pictures shown as to what each of the designs are. Every 3 pages the foil changes, starting with Gold foil, followed by Silver, Holographic, and Rainbow.The binding is pretty solid.There's a holder to put the scratching tool, but I would be careful about doing that because you might scratch something you don't want to, like your skin or belongings. The pages are a little bit thinner than the full sized engraving art but not by much.There are 12 ""sketching pages"" in the back of the book. The pages are very thin, so don't expect to be able to make works of art on them.The cover of the book is very thick, and it overhangs beyond the pages to prevent the edges of the pages being rubbed away by friction.Pro Tip:~I save my engraving tools from each engraving art that I do (which isn't that many, but I do a few of them over the course of a year or so) so that I have other engraving tools to go to because each tool varies just a little bit differently.~I bought Royal Brush Foil Engraving Art Scraper Tools, 4-Pack and I'm glad I did because I needed a finer, sharper, tool for some of the details. It was $3.99 with Prime shipping so it was worth it for me.~For those little details that are irritating, like the little parts where it is a line, and then the pattern quickly turns to a solid area, try to practice ""flicking"" and it may turn out better. I'm not good at it yet; it's so damn irritating to get a solid area when you didn't mean to.~As with any engraving art like this, you want to be careful and not be overzealous in your scratching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXLHAQMW69J2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WSGCG2#wasThisHelpful","R2PXLHAQMW69J2","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With this Chipped Sapphire color, it is the absolute same as the markers, distress ink, and re-inker.Put different colors down on a non-stick craft sheet, spray a little water on it, and then drag your paper through it to get a really cool marbleized/mixing effect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZRRW4DZ5640/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7MJU8S#wasThisHelpful","R1AZRRW4DZ5640","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dyan Reaveley came out with this journal block to fit her large couture stamps Ranger Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Couture Clear Stamps, 9 by 5-Inch, Walk In The Park . She also wanted something different to set her block apart from the rest, so she added that really cool wavy design.  I highly suggest searching on YouTube for ""Dyan Journal Block"" and see all the different things that you can do with this block.  There is also a ruler on the straight side.  I have dropped, clotheslined, stepped on this journal block and it's held up to everything.  I drop things like it's my job, I'm a colossal klutz. I'm really happy with not only the sturdiness, but that I can hold the block better in my hands versus a regular block.Pro Tip:There's two holes at the top that are in the same position as her stamps.  What I do is use two rings to keep all of my Dylusions stamps together and add this block to that so I always know where it is.Sometimes, using her alphabet stamps (Ranger Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Cling Stamp Collections 8.5 by 7-Inch, Dy's Alphabet ) , I choose the wavy part to put the letters on so they create a little bit of interest instead of them being in a straight line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWR4LGFSQ7CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BL43DCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CWR4LGFSQ7CV","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some of these 5 star reviews are suspect. I highly recommend you read up on how to tell a review is fake. It can help.I got a facial at a spa and my esthetician recommended this to use a few times a week. I'm 26 and have had moderate to severe acne for about 14 years. I have ugly scars on my face and body (and I used to be a model). My skin is trashed. It's been a constant battle. Nothing works long term, and believe me I tried just about anything. I've even tried antibiotics...everything short of Accutane. Let's just say I'm not the ideal candidate for Accutane.I desperately needed something that,A) took away as much dead, flaky skin as possible without leaving horrid rednessB) Would leave no residueC) Wouldn't cause my skin to over-produce oil in less than 12 hours (aka be greasier)And this does all of it. To thoroughly get the dead and flaky skin off of my face (including the flaky skin on blemishes),  I wet my face with just a little bit of water. Then I use as much of the scrub I need to cover my face and work it in. I use a circular motion. I rub it in until the ""grit"" feels dry-ish on my skin, and if there are still some flakes, I'll wet my fingers and continue with the circular motion. And I do all of this gently and without pressure. I let the scrub do its work. After I am satisfied, I just rinse it off while continuing to do the light, circular motions. I'm always turned off by the ""use this product for 1 minute, 2 minutes"" ect but my skin is worth the extra few minutes to my routine.This isn't a magic bullet. It doesn't solve the problem, but it does help significantly.  I'm one of those people where nothing is ""magic bullet"", there aren't even two ""magic bullets"". This has earned a permanent place in my shower.P.S. As a woman, I highly recommend being open minded and not let something marketed to men close windows for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVUIYRGLHDO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ZOD9W#wasThisHelpful","R2FVUIYRGLHDO1","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT:12/10/2014I found something that DOES show through the paper in this notebook. The stamp pads in the colors Ranger AIP-30461 Archival Inkpad, Vermillion and Ranger AIP-30638 Archival Inkpad, Rose Madder both products from Ranger. The Ranger AIP-31468 Archival Inkpad, Jet Black did not show through. You can see it plain as day on the back of the page. My original review still stands. I even re-tested those things that I listed before, and the results are still the same. So I guess this is a ""mostly no show thru"" notebook.My Original Review:There's a lot of hype surrounding this and they've done a excellent job promoting these sketchbooks at some art shows, so I was excited to get this.  After I started my testing, I couldn't remember why I was excited in the first place.Here's my breakdown:These feather:-Pigma Microns (ALL of them, and by all I mean ALL that are currently on the market right now)-Sharpies, Ultra Fine Point and Fine Point (which usually feather)-Sharpie Metallics (actually the paper leaves this gross halo around them)-Pilot Varsity Fountain pens- Distress marker; Fine tip and brush tip-Zig-Dylusions just spread across the paper, soaking in, no control over itGelly Roll pens do not, and did not, feather, but as far as the Glaze and Souffle go it just soaked right into the paper and gives no raised effect at all. The Gelly Roll Moonlight pens spread out more on the paper than they do most others.My bottom line:It does as advertised for what I tested it with; there is zero bleedthrough and no shadowing even when held up to sunlight.I can't use this notebook. I have no control over where things feather. I can't draw anything from any of my utensils (unless it's pencil, at least that doesn't feather) because it turns out to be something that looks like I drew it on the crappiest copy paper and drooled on it before any of the above medium dries. This sketchbook is unusable. Nice to know I paid good money for a blank  book that will sit around unused.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSWXHSKVTLMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00915UUUU#wasThisHelpful","R1QSWXHSKVTLMB","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE (November 13th, 2015):I still use and love this case. The leather is still soft, albeit a little scratched and a few worn spots. Only minor cosmetic wear and tear. I use this daily, and has been living on my couch since purchased. I have two dogs so you can imagine couch living with dogs.I am going to list what this case has been though:Hot pizza boxes, ricocheting 10 lb. dogs, drops to the floor, spilled on, condensating 2 liters of pop, and scratches.The stitching throughout has not moved, shifted, or loosened.The zippers and the zipper snaps are still in perfect condition; the zippers themselves are a little worn. Just a little though.My Pigma Microns, Jelly Roll, and pencil still fit perfectly and hasn't stretched out, plus I have 2 Microns per loop. I have the entire collection of Pigma Micron pens, Sakura 50050 59-Piece Pigma Ink Artist's Gift Set  To be honest, I didn't know how much abuse that this case could take since the leather was so soft and so nice to the touch. I am pleasantly surprised at how much abuse this case has put up with.Original Review from April 9th 2014:I asked questions to the owners on of many pencil cases here on Amazon about how well Pigma Microns fit in the case. Pretty much every pencil case fits Pigma Micron pens. This case comfortably fits 64 of my writing utensils (mostly Microns), and I try to leave one loop between each size tip for quicker selection. I really like that I can set this case up vertically, and stabley.This case is really nice. Kinda like 4 star hotel nice. The outside of the case is very soft, which was kinda a concern for me because I have two small dogs and I do my drawing and ""art-ing"" (that's right, I made it a verb) out in the living room; the case is normally on the couch. I've had this case on my couch for about 3 weeks now, and so far, so good. There are some little scratch marks on it but there really aren't any hardcore blemishes from it. The stitching is high quality, as are the zippers. The inside of the case is also very soft and reflects the high quality seen on the outside of the case.I make my own notebooks, and my  roughly 5.5"" x 7"" notebook with a 1 inch diameter binding coil with 40-50 pieces of 300 series smooth Bristol paper fits great in one side if there are no utensils in it. This case is really well made. I wouldn't really consider taking this out with me unless I'm going somewhere to DO drawing for two reasons. One: Afraid of all of the random crap that could happen to the smooth leather, and Two: it's on the big side. I carry a huge purse that my husband has nicknamed ""the Tardis"" (which I can now justify since I live in the Bay area, where re-usable bags are a necessity unless you want to pay 10 cents per paper bag) and this case wouldn't be easy to carry both weight wise and size wise.Pro Tip:- There isn't a special place for a pencil sharpener, so I have a small jewelry bag that I put the sharpener in (so the pencil sharpener debris doesn't infect everything it touches) and I place it where an unoccupied loop is and just shut the case. Same for my eraser. Caution while opening the case.-Keep drinks and other wet things away from the case. It will most likely stain. I spill things constantly, so that is why I keep it on my couch-Waterbrushes will not fit- Gelly Roll pens can fit 2 per loop- The loops do loosen up over time-The graphite from the pencils will mark up the inside of the case where the pencils are.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HNBPCRQPKI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YKQEFO#wasThisHelpful","R38HNBPCRQPKI6","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have an insatiable love affair of pens like I do, it's really, really hard to get this set out of your head. Can you hear it whispering your name?After I purchased my first set of Pigma Microns, Sakura 30062 6-Piece Pigma Micron Ink Pen Set, Black I fell in love with them and wanted more. So I purchased Sakura 30063 6-Piece Pigma Micron Assorted Colors 01 Ink Pen Set.  Then Sakura 38062 8-Piece Pigma Assorted Colors Brush Pen Set. When I came across this 59 piece set, I viewed it as Pigma Micron nirvana. These pens are great. They all came brand new, none of the pens were dry (I tested each one). In this set, all of the pens are the same quality that you would get in a blister package. They write smooth, don't skip, enough ink flow to the tip, but not so much that it pools and gets all yuckie and stuff, and doesn't get dry while you're writing or drawing. The colored pens are the same awesome quality of it's black ink pens. Quick Pro Tip: Don't press hard on the tip while you're writing or drawing. You don't need to. These aren't too  delicate, but if you put too much pressure at the right angle, that is the angle your tip is going to go to and might fray just a tiny bit. The pen may not produce the same tip size as it originally did. I've always been a bit heavy handed, and I learned this lesson the hard way.It is a big chunk of change to spend on a set of pens. There really isn't a concrete way of doing the math to decide how much savings you would have versus buying sets individually; sets come in different pen amounts, tip sizes, for different prices, and depending on where you get them from. I believe that there are worthwhile savings to be had getting them all at once like this. There may be pens that you can't get ahold of that are in this set. So it may look like a lot to spend on pens, but think about the savings. You are now totally justified in treating yourself to Micron heaven!The one hinderance of getting this set is that I already have some of the pens (which I shared above),. but now I have some back-ups. It's not like I have a significant enough amount of the collection before, so the doubles are minimal.On the back of the label you see in this picture that is inside of the case, there are circles in which you can do your own pen swatches for each color and nib size. Brilliant. The case that it comes in is alright, but I ended up putting them into my Leather Panel Style 120 Pencil Case Brown which I have reviewed and posted pictures of it (with my Microns in it) in that review.To the person who answered the question about what actually came in this set and provided the ink swatch: YOU ARE AWESOME!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JMNGCI02L6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YZLKPQ#wasThisHelpful","R21JMNGCI02L6O","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own Totally Tangled: Zentangle and Beyond and Time to Tangle with Color.  The item description on this particular book says that there are 20 pages, and of those 20 pages, page #1 is the front cover, and page #20 is the back cover. It is bound together with 2 staples. When I received this book, I felt that it was more like a booklet. I definitely had the expression of ""uhh... really??"" on my face even though I was alone in my apartment when opening my package.14 tangles of the 40 are just different types of leaves. THAT was disappointing.Pages 4-11 are what the 40 new Zentangles are on. I'm not impressed with the tangles. There are ""variations"" to most tangles as an extra step that can elaborate on the tangle, which is something I do like about the book.On pages 12-17 there are examples of different ways and settings that that the tangles can be used in/as. There are also instructions on how to do some of the projects that are shown, which I think is cool and inspirational.

"I've never bought a 12 x 12 paper pad online before. I prefer to see things like this in person to judge whether or not I should buy it, some paper pads have only 5 pages you love, and the rest gets put away and forgotten. Another reason why I was hesitant to get this online was because you can't see the WHOLE page(s) to see what they look like, only snippets. I prefer to look at paper as a whole. This is one of the only paper pads where I love almost every single page.The paper in this pad fall in-between the medium weight and heavy weight category. There are 48 pages, you get 2 pages of each design.I like to do paper piecing, like cutting out stamped images and layering them. The designs are wonderful. Instead of having just a repeated pattern throughout the pages, it has variations on each page design. It simulates mixed media, and there is the appearance of  depth with various complimentary things like crackle effects,watercolor effects, faded text that looks painted over, worn watercolored flowers with a subtle crackle over it, things like that.I love that if I stamp an image over a part of a page, cut it out, and stamp the same image in a different part of the paper (and cut out and add something to the first stamped image... an example is a stamp of a hat with a bow, I stamp on 2 different parts of the paper and on one stamp design I cut out just the bow and layer it on top of  a whole stamped image)  I'll still have coordination with different, complimentary, subtle differences that make it pop a little, on the same pages or different pages can compliment well too.If you are into mixed media-like designs, like subtle worn looks, and are looking for something truly different than other pads out there, this would be it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBUC861HMETUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BR2IOMG#wasThisHelpful","RBUC861HMETUP","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDITED ON JUNE 16TH 2015I repurchased this journal because I wanted to see if the quality had changed since March of 2014. It has significantly. This journal (which I had purchased from Amazon both times) can finally used and holds up to the same expected quality of the large journal. Both the large and small journals take Dylusions paint beautifully, and can even handle using spray inks on top of the paint. In fact, I (re) purchased this last month and it's almost full already. Thank you Ranger! Now on to the cover. The cover that they'e using isn't as smooth as the older journals, they definitely have a texture to them. This journal and the last 5""x8"" both of the elastic bands broke on me in the same spot. I don't think it's me, because the larger journals don't have a problem with that. What I decided to do was paint the elastic black, then took the Elastic Loops by Tim Holtz Idea-ology, 6.5 Inches, Pack of 10 Loops, Black, TH93141 hitched to the old elastic so I have the elastic problem fixed.ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM March 5, 2014I concur with others about being disappointed.I'm a big fan of the original Dylusions Creative Journal (large) so I decided to get this one too. Most of the time I like to work in smaller notebooks.I find there is significant bleed through, so I can't  use the backs of the pages I do. So if I do a 2 page spread, the backs of both sides are unusable. If you so use ink sprays, or even plain water, it will be ruining your work on the other side. It's so wasteful.What I've been doing is using other paper (Bristol smooth 300 series) to do my things on then using washi tape (like if you were to insert pages back into the journal; a technique that Dyan Reaveley does) to insert in between the spread that has work done on either side so there's an extra page there even if it's not the same paper as the journal.You can use a little distress paint on the backs of the journal paper that has the bleed through from the other side.I own a lot of the Dylusions rubber stamps, and the images can take up a lot of space on a page(s) because they are on the larger side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29OS5EZFUNR9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB0G2HA#wasThisHelpful","R29OS5EZFUNR9R","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The instructions are on the back of the book. For me, the directions weren't specific enough. There is definitely a learning curve. I'm just now starting to get it on my 6th flower. There are 5 pages of each paper design.Merely just following the instructions won't give you the beautiful results that are on the cover and on the instructions in the back. It will take some finagling. It will take patience.Concerns I had before ordering:1. That the petals wouldn't have good enough perforation, causing the petals to tear and become useless2. Ease of extracting the rose petals from the paper3. The perforations not being “clean” enough and leaving behind ugly perforated bumps4. Crappy directions5. Having to buy an extra product that is suggested/needed that I didn't know about6. That the paper would be too thin/too thick7.The amount of excess paper left behind after the flower petals are removed from the sheet from the rose parts not being close enough togetherHow my concerns panned out:1. The petals do have good perforation2. I found it easy to extract the petals from the paper3.  The perforations are “clean” and don’t leave behind those ugly perforation bumps that often comes with paper that is perforated4. The directions are indeed crappy, and I have yet to find a tutorial (video or otherwise) online that can provide clarification on the instructions5. The instructions it says to use a kebab stick to roll the petals, but other than that there aren’t any extra things that you HAVE to buy to create the roses6. The paper isn’t too thin or too thick; the weight of the paper is good7. The petals are placed very well so there is minimal excess paper to wastePro Tip:*If you need to walk away from the project before you’re finished with a rose, make sure they stay together*Don't take out all the rose petal pieces off of a sheet at once. It’ll just make it hard to figure out which size of petals goes with which rose*There are vertical rows of the flower petals that go with each rose size*The top right hand corner of each page there are small petals for small roses","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IGDEFA7JKGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MRM5CI#wasThisHelpful","R12IGDEFA7JKGO","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a total Ranger enthusiast. These are great for a variety of techniques, search on YouTube to see all the ways that they can be used. They coordinate perfectly with the Distress Ink Pads. I did swatches of the Ink Pads and the markers and the colors were virtually the same.  There is a pen-ish side for writing and a brush end. The fine tip seems to have minimal bleedthrough with regular cardstock, but the brush tip bleedthrough will depend on pressure used and how many times you go over it.Pro Tip:-If you are using the brush end to color on your rubber stamps before stamping them, use the side of the brush, not the very tip or you will make it so there isn't a ""tip"" anymore. I know because I did it. So don't do that. It's instant sad.-If you are utilizing these markers with watercolor techniques, be prepared for it to have various kinds of shading/blending, or lack thereof, depending on your surface. Tim Holtz did a YouTube video on how the results of the watercolor technique vary on different surfaces, but the title escapes me at the moment. Basically, use watercolor paper if you're going to do that.

With some wet mediums, the backing will crinkle up and it takes some extra care to peel off the backing in such a way that the ""sticky"" part of the sticky back canvas stays mostly intact.Also, I've trimmed the canvas to 8 1/2"" x 11"" and printed out some images from my inkjet printer with awesome results!Pro Tip:Using Dylusions Ink Spray will make the canvas warp almost immediately, and the only way I've found to flatten it out again is to place something heavy on top of it (once canvas is dry) and sticking it to something; but carefully because enough of the sprays will have the aforementioned results of the backing separating of the backing and the sticky part. The backing may warp with the canvas, but the crinkling happens when you try to straighten it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23K8H2TG69JJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M0JNVO#wasThisHelpful","R23K8H2TG69JJH","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually have a total of 13 pieces of Tim Holtz acrylic blocks; I had bought a small package to see if I liked them, then I bought the 9 piece package thinking that they would be of different sizes than the ones I already had, so I ended up having 3 pieces doubled. I would recommend just getting this 9 piece set.They do seem really flimsy, but seem to hold up well. Ballparking it, I've probably had these for a year and a half. I drop stuff constantly, so it's always important to me that things hold up well.They are easy to clean. If I get ink on them, I just wipe it away with an old t-shirt.One side is smooth, the other side have very slight bumps where the grid lines are, both sides are equally usable.Pro Tip:-When using a small-ish stamp, use one of the long-ish blocks placing your stamp at one end, and voila! You have a handle to press your stamp into the ink without getting your fingers inked up.-I don't think I've ever used the really small squares because personally I can't use them without getting ink on myself, the block, and some times even the outside of the stamp which shouldn't be inked. And most likely inking other things because I drop stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J2XXSNCVX13I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W8T0NE#wasThisHelpful","R1J2XXSNCVX13I","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These stamps are tiny, but beautifully detailed. I will stamp these in Archival Ink on Specialty Stamping Paper and use Distress Markers, or a craft nib to get ink from the Distressed Ink Pads onto my paper to fill it in with color. It looks great when you use a clear embossing pen and clear embossing powder over it after the ink is dry. They can be subtle, or you can make it a focal point if you're using a smaller surface. One technique I've done in the past was using leaf stamps/stencils and hanging the birdcage stamp from the stalks, and the birds randomly placed around. Another fun technique I've done is masking. For example, taking the teacup stamp, stamp it, put a mask over it (stamping it and cutting it out, and putting it over your stamped image so when you put other stamps on top of it, that mask will keep the stamps from overlapping) and stamping a clock with (LaBlanche) wings.These also stamp great with Distress Inks, it does capture the detail!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18R9HN19BHRII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOUIB88#wasThisHelpful","R18R9HN19BHRII","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the other (brighter) Glaze set a few months back and I absolutely love them. Unfortunately I pulled a stupid and left my cap off of the clear Glaze pen for a few weeks (I put my pens in a case), and I frowned when I went to use it and realized I had left the cap off of it. I couldn't find any open stock clear Glaze pens, and then I found these. I am a pen fanatic, I get excited when I get new pens, and since these had a WHITE Glaze pen AND a clear Glaze pen it was a no-brainer. I didn't have these colors. I have reviews on a few different writing utensils along with pictures of how they look from different angles on different kinds to paper, so I highly encourage you to view them. On the green colored pens, the one that looks darkest is actually the lighter green, and vice versa, so I highly recommend making a swatch; they don't come with the names of color on them either, so I made some up and labeled them (with a label maker, but you can always write it on a piece of paper and use clear tape to adhere it). It's a similar thing with the red and brown, they kind of look alike, but in good lighting you can make the distinction. They will take a bit to dry.I can't emphasize the love I have for the clear Glaze pen, it gives almost like an embossing effect, but without the powder mess that gets everywhere and a heat tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKH8R82WOAEWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HJ4CA4#wasThisHelpful","RKH8R82WOAEWB","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love text stamps, text paper, just about any text that can be used in crafting and whatnot. Like others have said, this is a very delicate stencil. It is not easy to clean, even if you're just using spray ink. If you're using permanent paint, soft gel medium, matte medium ect. You must clean it right away. Because it is so delicate, I use dish soap and the yellow side of a sponge to gently press through the stencil while holding it with my other hand or at the bottom of my (clean) sink. A lot of rinsing too. If you try to rub it with the green scrubby side, prepare to have to pick out pieces of the green scrubby and possibly take part(s) of the stencil with it.That being said, I do love the stencil, I just don't use it as often as I would like because when I'm on a roll, I don't want to stop what I'm doing to thoroughly clean a stencil (if I'm using Dylusions spray, I spray the hell out of it with water on an old t-shirt and blot it dry).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L37D0IEVA3ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007C7V9TK#wasThisHelpful","R1L37D0IEVA3ZH","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard and saw a lot of good things about this tool, so I decided to pick one up. The one I got does not cut perfect corners, and I have to ""chomp"" it 5 or 6 times for it to go all the way though a normal piece of chipboard; and even more surprisingly it does this on a single piece of cardstock as well. Only 1 time out of 10 does it chomp on the first try. It's the same for both sides. I bought this tool because I've started a new venture of hand making the best journals possible. I wanted to be able to get round corners quickly with chipboard and maybe 3 pieces of paper at one time. I thought it was user error at first, but it's not. I really wish it was user error.You know what I'm using now? A Martha Stewart corner rounder punch. I've had it for about a year and a half and it still rounds corners as well as it did when I first got it; I've punched (approximately) 1,300 corners since July (same number of pages throughout the notebooks/journals I've been making).

"This brace is usable. I have really small hands (I'm only 5ft tall) so it fit when I used the velcro to it's maximum tightness. It's comfortable, and doesn't chafe my skin where the thumbhole is. It's soft, but I don't find this brace breathable. It's not thick or heavy, but it's not too thin. It looks like it would be breathable in the picture though, doesn't it?Seriously though, who is going to describe their product with the phrase ""Is not breathable and will make you hot and sticky and consequently frown about it""?It took a few months for it to start getting noticeably dirty. I always take off my brace before I eat, before I go to the bathroom, when I wash my hands, when I'm cleaning, dishes, ect so it's just normal wear and tear. I do wear it throughout the day and all night except for the above events. Also, a week ago I noticed the Velcro to start to not work as well. It's like fabric Velcro or something. I've generally used the Futuro braces, and I do like them, but the one I have chafes my skin around the thumbhole a lot.Anecdotally, the whole ""for women"" crap is just that... crap. Marketing crap.

"I got these for my husband because most of the bags out here are girly and he didn't want to be seen carrying them out in public. It really is an easy fold bag. They are waaay bigger than expected, and that's a great thing! They seem to be very durable. Having them in the bag that comes with it is extremely useful. They are small, and I was worried that my husband would forget them and leave them in the house, forcing him to pay 10 cents per paper bag in ANY/ALL stores here because they made a plastic bag ban (which makes it extra fun to put your cart full of items loose in your cart and take them home that way because you forgot and are stubborn to pay the 10 cents like I am). The bag has a tie on it to keep the bags inside, and my husband uses that tie to hang it in the same places where he hangs his keys so he doesn't forget them when he leaves the house. Another reason why I'm happy I bought these bags was because ever since the plastic bag ban law was passed, the reusable bags being sold in the grocery stores got like 35% smaller for some reason.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTH77S1CTOKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007V6I71K#wasThisHelpful","R2PTH77S1CTOKA","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 WHITE CASE**UPDATED ON MARCH 5TH 2014:My white case still doesn't ""pick up dirt"", but it is starting to have some discoloration. I work a lot with water based inks that can cause some staining on things here and there (skin mostly) and my phone is always nearby. The discoloration is minor, confined to the outside edges of the back of the phone case, and is transparent; the discoloration is only seen when looking close at it. My case has no dents, and there is only one miniscule scratch on the back of the case. The black silicone part has no cracks, no scratches, no tears. That still looks new, save for little specs of dirt here and here. There are no signs of the silicone wearing where the buttons are.UPDATED ON OCTOBER 17TH 2013:I have had this case for a while now. My white case has not picked up and dirt. There are no scratches, no dents, no discoloration, no stains. I was curious to see how long a white case would stay white. I think I speak for many when I say that white things don't remain white for very long. I've dropped my phone and everything is still good. I'm glad I got this case. The ""lip"" of the case where it curves over the sides toward the screen makes the perfect depth for the screen to not touch the surface that you put you phone down screen first on. I really can't believe, and pleasantly surprised, that my phone case is still as white and blemish free as the day I put it on my awesome phone.Original Review:Pros:- Perfect Fit -Stays on my phone the way it should -Doesn't slip around -White case is staying white and I've had it for a bit -Won't slide off a table -Looks bad ass with the white S4 -Buttons are protected -Buttons are still completely accessible; when I press them it responds like there wasn't a case at all. -The case doesn't interfere with the functionality of the phone. -All of the lights can be seen -Doesn't interfere with the camera or flash -Doesn't cover up the back speaker -The name of the case is small and unobtrusive; is a very light silver.Cons:-From the description, it sounds to me as if the charging port would be covered with a plug that you would put back in when not in use, but it isn't a con for me personally.*I intend to update this review if and when the white color starts to show signs of discoloration or anything like that to give more specific idea of longevity.You NEED to protect your phone, end of story. Especially if you paid the equivalent of a car payment for it. I've always been leary of purchasing things of the phone protector persuasion online. It's something I prefer to see and touch, you know?  I looked at the case in detail and did some tests to get an idea of how durable it was going to be. I drop stuff. All the time. This case fits perfectly snug. I don't foresee the case separating from the phone unless you have to do a battery pull.  You won't be able to get the case off easily but it's not impossible. Remember that it's kinda the point of having a case to begin withI have a huge purse. My purse is not dirty however. I have an inside pocket that I put my cell phone in so that I'm not digging around for it, but of course sometimes it will fall out of the pocket into the gaping hole that is my purse lol. I have two dogs and work with ink a lot, and there are no signs of wear and tear whatsoever. It still looks brand new. No spots, discoloration, knicks, it looks perfectly out-of-the-box brand new. It hardly adds weight to the phone. It feels great in my hand. It won't easily slide off a table like a flat plastic case would.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QQPJ8DQFW85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN3VE4S#wasThisHelpful","R38QQPJ8DQFW85","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pens are a really nice metallic blend with opaque color. It's not too over-metallic-y. I like the shine that it gives. What I'm trying to say is the metallic pens are really well balanced in my opinion. I'm very happy with the assortment of colors and how they show up on paper. The in stays pretty true in the paper tests I have swatched and posted here. You can write with these like you would with a normal pen, and of course doodle. One of the things I like best about these is the opacity of the pens, and that they somehow managed to make them vivid, but in a metallic-y way.The package of pens that I received write smoothly, don't feather, and the ink comes out perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMBZJ3V6PXBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LXK5HS#wasThisHelpful","RXMBZJ3V6PXBF","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"is exactly my choice of words for this review. It's not that I don't like them, but I don't see myself using them a lot.Pro Tip: Don't expect to do any real writing with these like you would with other pens. You can spread your letters apart if you wanted to, but it can be a slow process.Pro Tip #2: If you do use regular paper or regular cardstock, don't expect these pens to give a 3-D effect. It really won't happen unless you layer the color on, even then not so much. They do take a few minutes to dry, but you can see the drying process happen. Using regular porous cardstock, the ink soaks right into the paper. They are nice, matte, soft colors, but in my comparison to the Glaze pens they don't raise hardly at all. I also tested them out on Ranger Inks Inkssentials Specialty Stamping Paper ATC's and got a more 3-D effect from the Sakura Glaze pens.Pro Tip #3: After waiting for the Souffle pens to dry, adding a Sakura Glaze pen (clear) Sakura - Glaze Pens 10/Pkg-Brights over the top of it gives an interesting result. Matte to Glaze!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGJNBQ51JO0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LR4ZDA#wasThisHelpful","R1TGJNBQ51JO0K","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew I was going to enjoy and get heavy use out of the clear Glaze pen, but was unsure about the opaque pens in the rest of the package. I really love the effects of embossing powder. Using embossing powder in bound art journals (I'm currently using the Ranger - Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Creative Journal) is a pain. For me, embossing powder is akin to sand... it ends up everywhere.These Glaze pens give an embossing powder-esque result. No bumps or pits or heat gun. They give a raised, glazed effect, but not quite like embossing powder. These are GLAZE and not shiny. Is there such a thing as semi-matte shiny? I am not disappointed by my purchase, and plan on using them as often as I can.Overall, I am happy with them.Pro Tip: Porous surfaces, like regular cardstock for example, absorb most of the ink, so you will get a more 'true' effect using something non-porous-ish. I did test them out on Ranger Inks Inkssentials Specialty Stamping Paper ATC's and got a more favorable result.Pro Tip #2: If you have Sakura 58350 10-Piece Blister Card Souffle Assorted Color 3-Dimensional Opaque Ink Pen Set , layering the clear Glaze on top of the DRIED Souffle ink gives an interesting result. The Souffle colors are matte, and these add a little bit of glaze to them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9TFCTXMTB5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S14PFM#wasThisHelpful","RL9TFCTXMTB5P","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not an expert on chipboard/book board, but this definitely didn't seem like ""medium weight"" to me. It doesn't take that much to bend it. I was making a pseudo-notebook/binder to put cling rubber stamps ((Ranger Inks Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Cling Stamp Collection Doodle Parts )) into using my CinchWe R Memory Keepers 71050-9 The Cinch Version 2, and the chipboard that the Cinch company  We R Memory Keepers Designer Book Board Chipboard, 8.5 by 11 Sheets is of significantly higher quality than this is. The chipboard WRMK is decent, heavy, can can put up with abuse.Back to what I was making.... I wanted something heavy duty-ish so I made front and back covers of my pseudo-notebook/binder using the WRMK chipboard, with this Grafix Medium Weight Chipboard adhered to the back of each of the covers (after decorating them with paper/embellishments) for extra reinforcement (and to hide where the paper is folded from the front side of the cover). It's done its job. I wouldn't use it for something that is going to actively be in use, or if you're planning on making a small little cheap notebook pad (like they sell at the grocery store or something), this would be an okay back cover for it.I read other reviews that suggested layering them... I would say do that if you don't want to waste money or return it.

"I have most of the Distress Ink pads, and I love them and use them almost every day.This review is about the CLEAR EMBOSSING INK. I never gave it a thought because I thought that it would give a ""Distressed"" result or something. I went to online forums and brick-and-mortar stores and told them of my embossing woes. No matter what powder I used, what embossing ink, no matter the paper or heat gun, I *always* got bumps, pits, and general uneven embossing. I've always loved the embossing part and how it COULD look. I wanted as close to a glass-like finish as possible and I always got told that it's supposed to be  bumpy and uneven. I refused to accept this, I knew it would be possible, and I would find out how. That's where the scrapbook store came in. I shared with them my plight and that the only way I get what I wanted was using Colorbox pigment ink. My local scrapbook store suggested I try this Distress Clear Embossing Ink, and I did, and I wish I had found out about it earlier. By earlier I mean a year ago.

"I've always been a fan of Stampers Anonymous stamps, especially the ones from Tim Holtz. I love the designs and each stamp set really has infinite possibilities. They are deeply etched, and fit into the Advantus Binder perfectly. The downside some people may have is that on the actual grey clingy part of the stamp there is no design to see what it is if it's laying rubber side down on a table or something. You can tell which designs are which when you put each stamp ""home"" behind the cover that you see above that the cling part sticks to.To me though, having no design on the grey clingy part doesn't bother me at all, as I always keep them in my Advantus binder. As with most other cling stamps, if it's not sticky enough anymore, just take a soft paper towel or old t-shirt or something that is damp with water and just swipe it across the cling part and allow it to dry for a minute or two. Also make sure your acrylic block is clean by doing the same thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IP28YNN6269/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B0ZVE0#wasThisHelpful","R14IP28YNN6269","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 other packages of Zig products, the scroll & brush, the calligraphy, and the writers markers. I love them all and use them almost daily. When I saw this package, I just had to order it. They have another package on Amazon that has less markers in the package, but if you're a pen/marker/writing with awesome materials fanatic like I am, go big or go home. And by home I mean somewhere dark where you will never see or experience the sheer awesome of these markers. If you're expecting a ton of glitter, this is not for you.  From my perspective, the ""fine glitter dust"" that they write on the box is accurate. You get the color of the marker and it isn't completely overrun by glitter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHRJ427964LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W8YGPG#wasThisHelpful","R1KHRJ427964LC","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have a sewing machine, nor will I ever own one, but I think that this is a nice alternative. Remember to get the sew easy piercing mat We R Memory Keepers Piercing Mat, 7 by 12-Inch otherwise you will destroy your head and make the plastic points wear down in 5 minutes, learn from my mistake lol. On my package that I got my head in, there was NO directions whatsoever. Just basically what you see here on the front of this package and I had to figure out how to do it myself, no help anywhere online either...and keep in mind I don't sew and will never own a sewing machine.  Honestly though, it didn't take more than a half hour to figure out how to make the designs that I submitted for user images above. I found that I can do it in a way that was completely neat on the front, and completely neat on the back. I think trying to cover up the stitches makes things look lumpy and/or I don't like the feel of it. It turns out that I do like to have the back stitching visible because it adds to the whole, ""Hey, I handmade this and this is how awesome it turned out. Oh, by the way, I stitched that b*tch. Myself.""It would have been 5 stars if there were instructions and if the pokey things that are supposed to put holes THROUGH the paper, instead of making indents or not piercing the paper through. I have a Tim Holtz craft pick Tonic Studios Tim Holtz 372 Retractable Craft Pickso I just use that to finish the job. It works great too since the sew easy tool comes with BLUNT needles, which I absolutely love about it. A regular needle isn't needed, and wouldn't work anyway because you need to use floss (I use 6 strand floss that I've had for years and never used all of... the floss they make is SO expensive for what it is and nothing special. Get a package of 36 skeins of floss that YOU like instead. More colors, more length, less money spent in comparison for what you're getting.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LAC9F04YY9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AGOZLK#wasThisHelpful","R6LAC9F04YY9V","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I avoided this because of the initial price, and the fact that it looks HUGE. I found that I was buying a lot of one of the little scotch dot roller things and was appalled at how much waste was happening with those refills having to do with the plastic. Yeah it was simple to pop open the casing where it says ""push"" take out the used up one and pop in a new one in 3 seconds...I took a closer look at this ATG gun, how long the rolls were, how long they would last me, and the amount of waste produced. In my point of view there isn't much waste, the ATG gun holds up pretty well (I drop things a lot), it's easy to use, easy to refill...but my favorite part is that if I get adhesive on something that I don't want it on, as long as it's not stuck between something, I can just roll it off with my fingers.

"When I first picked up perfect pearls pigments at a craft store, it was an impulse purchase. I didn't know anything about it. I followed the instructions on the back and followed it. When I was using it dry, it kept on rubbing off and getting shiny crap everywhere. Keep in mind I didn't know how to use them. After 3 days of playing around with it, I took it back to the store for a refund. About a week later, I saw a YouTube video that filled in the missing pieces for me, showing me a step that wasn't aware to be prior. I had a ""Ohhh, THAT'S how you do it!"" moment. I wasn't too keen on the colors of the powder that I returned to the store anyway, so here I come to Amazon.I love these colors, and love that I now know how to use them correctly.

"I love this cart, and I think it loves me right back. There's a place on top that is square and has little divider like things on it that reminds me of those plates that are sectioned off so your food doesn't touch, but without the plate. This cart is very sturdy... I have like 10 punches (in one drawer), 6 12x12 paper pads(in another drawer), a whole drawer full of wooden stamps, and a drawer FULL of all of my embellishments. The whole part that I can take out a drawer that has a sturdy, well made snap on lid is very nice. We have two 9 pound dogs, and one of them thinks it's cute to sit on my canvas bags that has my scoreboard, self healing mat, laptop bags ect. so naturally she thought it would be funny if she pounced and then sat on one of the snapped shut drawers that I had on the floor temporarily because I was in the middle of doing something. The top to that drawer didn't bend..crack..nothing. The first time she did that to one of my drawers I about had a heart attack. Well, she continues to do it, and fortunately she understands what ""OFF!"" means...which involves her jumping her little 9 lb butt off the drawer with her NAILS as a push off (like when swimmers push off the wall to get going). Not even a scratch, dent, nothing. She also likes sitting on my scrap paper when that drawer is open and on the floor (for my convenience, work space is limited sometimes).So yeah, sturdy and well made!Pro Tip: Put the heaviest stuff in the bottom drawer and work your way up with stuff that weighs less, I have had two occasions where I couldn't get a drawer out easily because I had something EXTREMELY heave above it (like my 10 Martha Stewart punches that I have in one drawer, for example). There are no ""tracks"" on it that you have to align the drawers with, just slide 'em in and out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZKXO1CNCLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XNWDVG#wasThisHelpful","R3QZKXO1CNCLK","A2TH26BCG1MEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TH26BCG1MEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the ONE MODE VERSION.  I bought 3 of these lights and all 3 work great!  They are $3, so don't expect a $100 tactical flashlight with blinding light capable of signaling ships at sea during a squall. These lights are great for average, around the house illumination requirements.  They are plenty bright on a single AA battery, are pretty sturdy with a solid switch, and small enough to keep in a pocket, purse, or glovebox.  My shipment arrived in 11 days from the seller ""One by One"".  I am very happy with these lights and highly recommend them.

"I bought 5 of these lights to mount on the poorly illuminated sides of my house and have had them for a month.  I am glad I did!  The installation was simple.  I just drilled 2 pilot holes, screwed the bracket into the wood trim, and set the light onto the bracket.  The light is very secure once installed and can be easily removed if needed to use as a flashlight.  The lights turn on at dusk with just enough light to see where I'm walking and off at dawn.  When I walk near them they turn onto high and illuminate a large area which is great for security. They have all remained illuminated throughout the night and have never run out of power even on cloudy days.  For the price, they can't be beat.  My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to add a mode that keeps the light off until it senses motion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKHWKJ9VMXDSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ8LYYS#wasThisHelpful","RKHWKJ9VMXDSN","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These were great for replacing my 60 watt incandescent bulbs in my ceiling fan.  The price of this 3 pack is cheaper than I can find at my local big box stores.  As others have mentioned, there is a very quiet hum when I turn them on, but it seems to go away after about 10 minutes.  I have cheap rotary dimmers in my house and they work fine with these bulbs.  The bulbs dim well, but be aware that they seem brighter when dimmed than incandescent bulbs because of the color of the light.  These lights at full brightness are slightly whiter than soft white incandescent bulbs.  When dimmed, these remain the same white color while incandescent bulbs give of an orange ""fireplace"" look.  That is fine with me but something to be aware of if you are new to LED lighting.  The best part is they definitely seem brighter than the 60 watt bulbs that I replaced which significantly brightened up our poorly lit family room.  I just bought 2 more sets.

"Admittedly, I'm a novice with wireless cameras and was a little nervous about setting one up.  It was absolutely simple.  If you can install an app on your phone and plug a cord into the wall, you can set this up.  I have been using this for about 4 months now and it works well for my needs.  I love having the peace of mind of checking on my house and dog from wherever I am at any time.  Here's the big downside, the camera pans up toward the ceiling frequently by itself and stays there.  This causes the motion sensor to not pick up movement rendering the camera useless if you are using it for home security (I'm not).  There is no way of knowing this occurred until I open the app and see it is pointed at the ceiling and readjust it.  I have moved it next to my router thinking that would help but it didn't.Pros:1.  Very easy set up.  Install the free SightHD app on your device, plug camera into wall outlet, tweek app settings as desired. That's it.2.  Stores video and audio on microSD card.  No fees to use cloud storage.3.  Great image quality in daylight and absolute darkness.  Great video and still images if you want to save an image from footage.4.  Motion activation works well and sends notifications to my phone (when it stays pointing in the right direction)5.  Great WiFi connectivity across my house from the router.6.  Customer support was helpful answering questionsCons:1.  Instructions are fine for initial setup, but there is nothing explaining settings adjustments in the app. It is not very intuitive.2.  The app is a little clunky and basic.  Had to play with settings a lot and company had to help me activate push notifications.3.  Fairly expensive.  Purchased as a lightning deal for $79, but regular price is much higher than Foscam and other name brands.4.  MicroSD card can be easily removed by intruders if used for home security and your video is lost.  Try to hide it if possible.5.  Daily the camera turns up facing the ceiling all by itself which is a deal breaker if you're using it for home securityOverall, I am somewhat happy with it and would possibly buy it again (at the discounted price, not $149).  I was very happy with the initial easy setup.  I had problems getting the motion alert notifications, so here is what customer service said and it worked:  From the app, press ""edit settings"", press ""settings"", press ""advanced settings"", press ""email setting"" and enter your email address.  Then press the back arrow and press ""save"" in the top right corner.  Here's what wasn't clear to me... You need to go back to the main page, press ""i"" for info, press ""notify"", and enable the notifications.  It would be nice if there were instructions included or available online that explained some of this.  Hope that helped someone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2V7D6EKJLCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O469O6M#wasThisHelpful","RN2V7D6EKJLCF","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had my watch for about a month now and I love it!  My wife does make fun of it and calls it my ""dork watch"", but it is really not that bad.  Setup was a breeze.  I turned it on, downloaded the Pebble app on my Droid, synced them, and was up and running in 5 minutes.Downloading watch faces was simple using ""Pebble Apps"" to personalize my watch, however, I found the selection to be lacking.  I decided to make my own using www.watchface-generator.de which was flawless.  In minutes, I selected a picture from my library and created my own watch face.  Other apps are available as well through Google Play, but Pebble actually released info that they will be creating their own app store in the first quarter of the year.  Another great app is RunKeeper which syncs flawlessly with the Pebble.  When I turn it on for my runs, it immediately displays my speed and time on my watch and records it to track my fitness goals.  Last but not least, the watch also syncs with my Pandora account allowing me to control my music without having to use my phone constantly.  Huge benefit when driving since I play my phone through my car stereo all day at work.Overall, this watch is absolutely a blast to play with.  The apps are great and will most likely improve over time with the new app store.  The watch looks pretty good (not too big and nerdy).  The display is easy to see in all light conditions.  The ability to display my contacts that call, text messages, and emails is a huge benefit.  The bluetooth connectivity works great and prevents me from missing important calls when I walk away from my phone up to about 50 feet away (I keep the ringer off).

"This fan is like having my very own helicopter in my exercise room.  It definitely moves a lot more air than any fan I've owned.  That said, the massive amount of air that it moves is pretty loud and forces me to turn my tv/music up pretty loud to hear.  I am not complaining about it, but if you are worried about noise, look elsewhere.  The fan is made of aluminum so there are no plastic parts visible.  The base is sturdy and I have absolutely no movement or wobble when it is on high.  The cage has small enough holes that fingers should not reach the blades.  The fan works great!Wall mounting was a breeze.  It came with a pretty heavy duty bracket with two holes.  I screwed the bracket in to a stud with two 2"" lag screws and it is very sturdy.  The fan rests inside the bracket and I can just lift it off the wall if I want to move it around the house.  It took less than 5 minutes from the time I opened the box to have it finished.I knocked a star off from the rating for 2 reasons. The fan arrived with one of the two locking buttons broken.  I can only lock one side of the base in place.  It isn't a big deal because of the way I mounted it, but I was disappointed with the cheaply made thin metal that arrived snapped in half.  The other gripe is that it tells you to use 2 lag screws (not included). Really? They couldn't spring for the extra 50 cents to include 2 screws? I instead had to wait a couple days until I had time to go to the hardware store before I could hang it.  Again, no big deal but a little annoying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351XI5ORVKR6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073CQ9XA#wasThisHelpful","R351XI5ORVKR6E","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We adopted a 90lb lab recently that apparently was allowed on furniture in his previous life.  We tried everything to teach him to stay off the couches and bed, but he is a persistent bugger.  I was tired of piling suitcases, chairs, and stepladders on the furniture every day.  I was tired of my house looking like the Clampetts had just moved in.  Not only was it an eyesore, but he still managed to squeeze into little spots and sleep there anyway.  Of course he was ashamed of himself everytime I came home and found him there and had an adorable ""I'm sorry"" face, but he would be back up there as soon as I left again.  I bought 1 Tattle Tale to try before buying a bunch of them.  It seemed to work well for a week, so I bought 4 more.  He bumped into the couch the first day we had it, it beeped, and he walked away.  I have seen him walk up to the couches and inspect the Tattle Tales, but he just walks away everytime.  He has never jumped onto our furniture again in the last month.The Tattle Tale beeps loud enough to deter my dog, but it is not blaringly loud by any means.  I have one on my king size bed, two on my sectional, and one on each of my other couches.  I don't even turn them on most of the time now because he just leaves them alone when he sees them on the furniture.  I understand all dogs are different.  I have heard of some dogs chewing them up or burying them in the yard, but it definitely worked for my buddy.  He is finally using his plethora of dog beds we have bought him.Another cheaper alternative:  I bought Emergency Mylar Thermal Blankets (Pack of 10) to put on all of my furniture.  These emergency blankets are cheap and I wrapped them around my couch cushions and bed.  They actually worked really well at keeping him off the furniture.  Dogs typically do not like to lay on noisy crinkly material.  I just got tired of placing them on everything when I left the house.  I prefer the Tattle Tale for simplicity, but if you want something much cheaper, the emergency blankets did the trick too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HY17CL7PUMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ANOT9U#wasThisHelpful","R39HY17CL7PUMQ","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, this is pretty expensive for a coffee mug, but it is by far the best mug I've ever owned.  I have put it through the paces.  First of all, this keeps beverages hot forever.  I filled it with hot coffee yesterday at 9:00am and brought it to work.  I forgot about it until 11:00pm and decided to drink it on my way home... Still HOT! I have never seen a mug that would keep drinks hot for at least 14 hours.  Secondly, I cannot get it to spill no matter how hard I try.  I shake it around and let it roll around the floor of my truck with not so much as a drop leaking.  I would feel confident with it in a backpack or purse, and it locks to keep the lid from inadvertently opening.The mug is very easy to clean.  All of the parts are easy to disassemble for washing and prevent funk from building up in hard to clean places.  This mug is incredible.  If I had to think of something negative, I would say the price is a little steep.  But you get what you pay for.  I also wish they made a larger size.  Then again, I could probably stand to drink a little less coffee and drink a little more water instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGGEZ6B9D8BTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHOUI86#wasThisHelpful","RGGEZ6B9D8BTE","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a paramedic and outdoor enthusiast, I have used these and similar brands for many purposes.  First of all, I did receive 10 in a pack and have ordered them before and also received 10.  I am not sure why some people only received one.The blankets' uses are only limited by your imagination.  Yes, they work for emergency purposes if used correctly.  If you plan on buying these to warm you, you will be disappointed.  They are designed to preserve your body heat and prevent it from escaping.  They also keep the wind away to some degree.  Google them for more information about how bodies lose heat if you're interested.  I have used them a few times for medical purposes to prevent shock, but generally do not.  Nothing is better than actively rewarming someone with warm air and warm dry clothing or blankets.  However, these do help in a pinch if it is all you have. Ultimately, there is no replacement for proper planning when hiking/backpacking.For less than a dollar each, these have tons of uses. They can be used to cover furniture or as a drop cloth when painting etc.  I have used them as a ground cover while camping, but they are a little noisy and crinkly.  The best use I found recently was keeping my dog off my couches.  I adopted a lab and he wants to live on people furniture.  I cover the couches and bed with these and he stays off.  He does not like the crinkly noise and feel when he lays on them.  Problem solved!  Just buy a pack for $6 and keep them around the house, in the glovebox, and in your backpack.  Trust me, you will find plenty of uses for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEFKV6ZHLA28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GCRWCG#wasThisHelpful","RLEFKV6ZHLA28","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Prior to owning this, I used maglights and other tools to break windows, and it is much harder than you think.  It usually took multiple whacks and sprayed glass everywhere.

Great compact tool to store close to your driver's seat so you know where it is in an emergency.  I carry one in my uniform, and one in each of my vehicles.

"I have used Bodum french presses for years, and it is the only coffee I like now.  I was tired of drinking hotel coffee on work trips, so I bought this.  It makes coffee just like at home and I love it.  The mug is well made and sturdy.  The lid fits nicely.  The seal is great between the mug and lid.  I get a little leaking from the drink spout if I shake it around, but not too bad.  Even if a little coffee sloshes out, it just goes back into the mug since the drink spout is recessed.  The mug keeps my coffee HOT for 2 hours and warm for about 5 hours.  The mug stays completely cool to the touch. The size is great and fits my cup holders nicely without moving around. The plunger and filter are great quality.  Very sturdy and easy to clean.  Makes a great non-bitter cup of coffee.Making coffee is a snap. Dump in a couple scoops of COARSE grounds, pour hot water in, stir and screw the lid on. Let it sit for 5 minutes and then depress the plunger.  You can pour cream/sugar in through the drink spout after you attach the lid if desired. Do not remove the lid after plunging to add things unless you like chewing your coffee.  I just swirl it around with the lid closed to mix it up.  Cleaning is easy even in a hotel bathroom sink.  Just like the regular Bodum presses, you can unscrew the mesh filter for easy rinsing.TIP: Make sure the filter screen is screwed on to the plunger tightly before pressing the coffee.  The filter can unscrew while screwing the lid on.  I had it detach once and it was not easy to get out of the mug (and you will definitely waste a cup of coffee).  As long as the screen is checked before you put the lid on you will not have any problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDGT9PISZ9TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TYX0UG#wasThisHelpful","R2MDGT9PISZ9TQ","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You need to press the chuck onto the presta valve pretty hard to get a tube to fill.  The spring forces the little black piece on the back outward allowing air to flow.  If you have difficulty, you probably just need to push harder.  My wife had a hard time when she first used it, and thought it was broken. Now she loves it.

"I am not a big fan of these boxer briefs.  They feel fine initially, but they start to bunch up in the groin after moving around for a while.  After they bunch up, they put a lot of pressure on the boys.  I have had a lot of pain a few times after wearing them all day.  The material is not very cool and doesn't wick moisture very well in the Arizona heat.  They tend to be soaked when I get home from work.  The waistband also rolls over which is not a big deal, but a little annoying. I finally threw these underwear away after the last time I wore them.I also bought a couple Champion Men's Tech Performance Boxer Brief.  I definitely prefer the tech ones after 6 months.  The tech briefs are much cooler and lighter weight.  No problems with them bunching either.  The ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Boxer Brief is my favorite though.

"Let me first say, this is a great price for three clickers.  They work great and feel good in my hand.  People complained about it being too quiet, but I have not experienced that at all.  They are plenty loud for indoor use or a relatively quiet outdoor area.  If you are trying to train your dog on a subway platform, you may want a louder one.  There is not much else to say about the clicker itself.Now for the training.  I have never used clickers before, but tried it after reading a Karen Pryor book and information on the web.  I adopted a 2 year old boxer from a rescue and she had very little training or manners.  She was terrified to get into a crate, didn't know any commands, and has separation anxiety.  I was amazed how well this training worked.  I took a day off and decided to work on ""crate"", ""sit"", and ""stay"".  She initially would not walk near her crate at all. In one day, using baby steps, she actually wanted to be in her crate.  My wife came home and was stunned.  I said ""crate"" and she walked in immediately and layed down. Not only that, but she also showed off by trying to get into her crate when I shut the door. She isn't perfect about it yet, but there was a huge improvement in just one day.  The crate training is also slowly helping her anxiety.  She also sits on command very easily now.  I wish I could say the same for ""stay"", but we will get there.  Overall, I am completely sold on the clicker idea.  I was always raised to ""train"" an animal by yelling NO! over and over and sometimes giving swats on the butt.  This is not only quicker, but it is much less stressful and traumatic for the dog and the owner.  I am confident that yelling ""NO!"" would have just made her anxiety worse in a new home.  If you haven't tried it, give it a shot.  If you are already using clickers this specific set is a great value.  Take it from a beginner that experienced immediate results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DM3PVCG6XNGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LAS2KW#wasThisHelpful","R1DM3PVCG6XNGT","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These underwear are absolutely the best!  I have tried a number of athletic boxer briefs, but these are my favorite.  They stay cool and dry in our hot AZ summers.  They breath well and don't turn into a swamp.  They are comfortable and fit great.  I have a 32"" waist and the small fits great.  The elastic does not roll like some of my Champion boxer briefs and there is minimal bunching or riding up.  I just wish they were a little cheaper, but they are worth it.  I buy a couple at a time until I can phase out my old boxer briefs.  Try a pair and you will never want to wear anything else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9ADUWR0GE9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M0MN16#wasThisHelpful","R2F9ADUWR0GE9Y","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying I am not a dancer, so I can't say how these work for that.  I bought these when I was sent to the east coast recently to assist with some paramedic shifts.  I worked 16 hour days outside in 10 to 20 degree temperatures in the wind (uphill both ways).  As an Arizona boy, I don't handle cold weather well.  I wore these under my Under Armour cold gear.  The Under Armour worked great for warmth, but they didn't cut the wind much.  These tights definitely helped with the wind factor.  Many of my coworkers were miserable all day, but I was nice and warm.  These were true to size.  I usually wear a men's 32 or 34, and the large fit perfectly.  The tights were comfortable and I had no complaints at all.

"We initially started using Feliway about two years ago when we adopted a chocolate lab.  Our two preexisting cats did not approve of their new roommate, even though she completely ignored the cats. We noticed a significant improvement in the cats behavior around the dog after a day or two.  They did not seem as nervous and edgy with the Feliway.  While it helped their attitude toward the dog, the biggest improvement was between the two cats. They sometimes get along, but tend to hiss and spat at each other frequently and always have.  They are fine most of the time, but there are a few areas in the house that they get pretty territorial over.  We have two plug-ins in the house located where the cats tend to cohabit.  Their territorial spats used to occur almost daily.  When using Feliway, they may have a spat every week or so. We can tell when the refill is empty based upon their behavior toward each other.  It did not completely fix the problem, but I would say it is 75% better.  I am sure results will vary from cat to cat, but it helped calm our household.  If you are considering it, give it a try.  If it doesn't work, you are out $20.  If it does work, you will have a happier family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEF4ZB1UP1SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CPAV3O#wasThisHelpful","RUEF4ZB1UP1SX","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the Oppo BDP-93 in my wish list for 2 years, but could not bring myself to buy a $500 bluray player.  Then I saw the new BDP-103 model and really NEEDED it.  I still could not justify $500 for myself, but the selfless guy I am bought it for my wife for Christmas.  I found a loophole.  We both love it.  I had a Panasonic Bluray player and it took about 2 minutes to turn on and load a Bluray disc.  I was completely amazed with the load speed of the Oppo.  I am watching a movie within 30 seconds of pushing the power button.  Load time is about 5 seconds.  The Oppo discovered my Wifi network right away and was up and running.  It automatically tells me when a firmware update is available and does it quickly.  The streaming quality is definitely better than the Roku that I have sitting next to it.The video quality is noticeably better than my Panasonic.  It has its own picture control settings separate from the TV.  The most amazing improvement in my opinion is the audio quality.  I have an Onkyo receiver with a 5.1 Klipsch surround system.  The difference was very obvious from the Panasonic.  We tried the Dark Knight bluray as a demo and just kept looking at each other and smiling during the movie.  The audio quality is incredible.  It is a pleasant change to see the pride Oppo takes in every aspect of their product, right down to the packaging.  The player was packaged securely in a sturdy box and was wrapped in an Oppo bag.  If I had to think of any improvement, it would be to add more apps to the streaming capabilities.  It could use Amazon and Hulu Plus to make it even better.If you can get past the cost, you will be very pleased with this Bluray player.  It makes a great Christmas present for the whole family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OA1IMOB1RV2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LRR5AQ#wasThisHelpful","R3OA1IMOB1RV2G","A2896AITBHP4XW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2896AITBHP4XW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the HAAN SI-70 in March of 2012.  After replacing my carpet with tile, I wanted something to keep it clean.  I vacuum my floor once a week and then use my HAAN to clean it.  Using my HAAN leaves the floor looking shiny and new each time, and makes it  slick enough to sock skate across the living room.  My wife and I love the fact it uses water with no harmful chemicals.  The included pads work great and will pick up small pieces of dirt and a little pet hair.  Stuck on spots require leaving the steamer on them for 20 or 30 seconds to loosen up the gunk, but it comes out fine.  We purchased a couple of Haan's ""noodle pads"" from their website to try them out.  We decided we actually like the pads that came with the unit better.  The noodle pads tend to leave little streaks on the tile, but I don't have that problem with the others.The Haan heats up very quickly and the temperature of the steam that comes out is great.  It is hot enough that the floor only remains wet for a few seconds after each pass.  It is nice to have dry floors so quickly.  We are so happy with our Haan that I bought one for my mom last Christmas.  She is equally happy with hers.  Please keep in mind, this is just a mop.  If you expect it to pick up all of your pet hair and loose dirt, you will be disappointed.  I know there are ""all in one"" mops out there, but I have always heard mixed reviews about them.  All I can say is this one works great.I have tried all of the attachments.  The small pad works excellent on my kitchen counters and smooth top stove.  It even cleaned my caked on gunk from the oven window and it looked new.  I have tried the little nozzle attachment on my sink drains and shower grout lines and was not that impressed.  The glide adapter works very well on my couches.  It really freshens them up and leaves them looking and smelling clean.  Hope this helped.

"Summary:These AV500 adapters give you an ethernet plug just about anywhere you have a wall socket. They are easy to use, fast, and have proven reliable over time. If you don’t have a wall socket in the right location, just plug the AV500 into an extension cord.Pros:- dead simple to setup initially. Just plug them in, plug in your devices and it works.- very simple to engage secure mode (128 bit AES encryption). Press and hold the pairing button on each adapter, and within 60 seconds you’ll be in business.- reliable. I’ve been using these adapters (single port version) for over a year, and had no problems even when power failures occur [see note 1]- good way to speed up internet access on older laptops and other equipment that don’t have the latest WiFi circuitry.Cons:- symbols on the device are hard to read (white characters on light gray background).- no real feedback or indication that the device is indeed operating in secure mode. If would be nice if there was an indicator light that meant “secure mode” which could give a constant assurance to the user.Detailed Info:What’s in the box? 2 Ethernet cables, one power line adapter with 2 ethernet ports, and one power line adapter with a single ethernet port. Typically, the single port adapter would be the one you plug into your WiFi modem. You don’t have to use both ports on the double adapter - it works just fine with either one or two devices plugged in. Because the adapters are so fast, you are unlikely to notice any speed degradation if you do have two devices plugged into the double unit (I certainly didn’t with a Mac and PC plugged in).If you have a relatively new WiFi network and computers (using 802.11 N or better) you are unlikely to notice a speed improvement when accessing the internet using one of these AV500 adapters. I got the same 35 Mbps download test speeds on both.I have a laptop using an older WiFi setup (802.11 G) and it enjoyed significant speed improvement on internet speed tests going from 20 Mbps to 35 Mbps with the AV500.I took an AV500 adapter out to my detached workshop - it’s far enough away that WiFi can be a bit spotty. It has a separate power panel, that feeds from the main house panel. I found the AV500 worked surprisingly well turning in internet speed tests about the same as in the main house [see note 2].Since I already owned a few extra adapters, I tested this kit with 3 adapters all connecting at the same time, in secure mode. All the computers worked fine with no slowdowns, or hiccups.Range is specified as 300 meters (1,000+ feet) over single circuit. That’s far more than typical indoor WiFi range, which according to wikipedia is about 32 meters.Notes:[1] - on my Windows 7 machine, the internet connection occasionally stops working, about ten minutes after it comes out of sleep mode. I unplug the AV500 adapter from the wall and then plug it back in and everything starts working again. Since this same problem occurred when using a different brand of wireless adapter, I believe it is a Windows 7 issue and not a problem with the TP-Link device.[2] - in my detached workshop I did 5 internet speed tests using a different outlet for each one. One of the tests was slightly below normal at 32 Mbps, but the other 4 were 35 Mbps - exactly the same as tests performed inside the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MFSAH5L8OYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29KRK#wasThisHelpful","R25MFSAH5L8OYN","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review VIM Tools HBR4 Ratchet BitTitle: I Like it so much I’ve already bought a second oneFor many years I have carried a 1/4” ratchet driver in my tool belt, both for getting into tight spaces, for general use, and for when I need more torque than a screwdriver provides but still want to “feel” what I’m doing.A few months ago my trusty ratchet driver died, and I began searching around here on amazon and elsewhere for a replacement. Thanks to the good folks who take time to leave thoughtful reviews, I decided to give this ratchet a try, and I must say it’s a huge step up from my old one.It has a much finer ratchet effect due to it’s large number of teeth (52 I think). That means it works much more quickly in confined spaces. It also gives it a lovely feel, like a fine precision instrument (which, indeed it is).The head is tiny, even smaller than my original tool, which is a huge plus.All parts, with the exception of the grip area of the handle, are steel, including the tiny reverse lever. I mention this because I recall one review that stated it was plastic.The bit is held tightly in place by friction, and there is a through hole which makes it easy to remove the tightly held bits. You can rotate the black metal ring for quick threading, and use the handle to finish when things tighten up.For the modest price, this is a very good value.If you constantly use 1/4” drive bits as I do, you should definitely consider this high quality, modestly priced tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CJV5C5SCUBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TSW0DA#wasThisHelpful","R18CJV5C5SCUBN","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a week since I received this square. It has already become one of my favorite marking and measuring tools (I mostly do woodworking).Pros:- finely machined, high quality square- perfectly matches the accuracy of other non-sliding machinist squares I own (no light visible between top and sides when pressed against another known-true square)- nice weight, lighter than solid squares- blade slides smoothly and locks tightly in place (see note 1)- markings on blade have high definition, are easy to read- the blems (blemishes) are very minor, and strictly cosmetic (see photos)- the seller, Taylor Toolworks, is very responsive. (See note 2).- the square is exactly 1” wide, which makes aligning at any location easier due to having two reference surfaces.Cons:- I'm racking my brain, trying to think of something. Guess what? Nothing comes to mind.- Okay, I did think of something. If you are an absolute perfectionist, the slight cosmetic blems might drive you crazy. If this describes you, simply buy the unblemished version.Note 1:  As delivered this square adjusts quite smoothly - much better than your average carpenters square. However, you can improve the action even more by taking it apart and smoothing off the tiny burrs on each side of the lock pin (the ridge near the top of the pin, to be exact). Don't worry, this won't affect accuracy as that comes from registration of the edge of the blade against the square. I also applied a tiny drop of lubricant on the sliding surfaces. These two steps made a significant improvement in the action, which was already very good to begin with. Now it is silky smooth.If you are interested, I used Boeshield T-9 lubricant, which dries to a waxy film that does not attract dust. I smoothed the burrs with a few strokes of a fine file, followed by some gentle rubbing against very fine 1000 grit sandpaper.Note 2: There was one small problem with the square I received. The blade did not lock tightly in place every time - it took a few days before I noticed this. I took it apart and determined the locking screw (1/4-28 thread) was a little too loose, possibly due to damaged threads. I contacted Taylor Toolworks , they promptly sent me a new screw, and it completely fixed the problem. Even though I asked for just the screw, they sent me the entire locking mechanism (screw, nut and spring) which was above and beyond what I was expecting. Very good customer service indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCRVOOZD39SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDCNSA2#wasThisHelpful","R3GCRVOOZD39SE","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this set to have on hand for those relatively rare occasions when I am working on tiny projects that exceed the ability of my needle nose pliers. Considering the cost is less than 4 dollars per tool, I did not expect perfection. And I did not get it.When first used, a black oily substance appears around the joint. This is easily wiped off and no big deal. I expect this will be self-correcting given a little more use.I found all the jaws align fairly well - certainly good enough to be functional. The end nippers are effective as long as one does not exceed their capacity (you’ll need regular sized ones too I suspect!). The case is pretty good quality, especially considering the budget cost.One of the pliers has a slight problem in that the spring doesn’t always open the jaws as it should. It seems that the tiny pair of leaf springs is slightly misaligned. It’s not a big enough deal for me to return the set, and I expect I can correct it with a little fiddling some day (a great job for the other mini-pliers in the set!).If you are a heavy user of small scale pliers, you may wish to spend more and get more quality. However, if you are an occasional or light-duty user, this inexpensive set seems like a great bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCHLAA793HR5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KZH78W#wasThisHelpful","RCHLAA793HR5D","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been using this sharp, aggressive blade on my Fein MM 350Q. It fits perfectly, but because it’s uses Bosch’s OIS system, it only mounts in 90 degree increments. If you need more angles, consider purchasing the Bosch OIS001 adapter, and you will be able to mount it in 30 degree increments.This blade is thicker than my other Fein metal and wood blades, probably due to accommodate the carbide teeth. The wider kerf often does not matter, but when it does one needs to fall back to using a non-carbide blade. The extra thickness is a reasonable trade-off, considering this blade can handle surprise encounters with metal much better than other blades.This blade cuts wood very well, but its not quite as smooth or fast cutting as dedicated wood blades. I presume that’s also a tradeoff resulting from the nature of carbide or extra thickness.The blade seems more rigid than others. Depending on what you are using it for, this can be either a good or bad thing. In my work, it’s usually a plus.I haven’t worn this out yet - not even close. It’s very durable and easily worth the additional cost over non-carbide blades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGFGSYK6A0AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELC9R9S#wasThisHelpful","R3UGFGSYK6A0AZ","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most of my work is with wood, but I do some small scale metal-work and thought this might come in handy occasionally. It has. But I am surprised by how often I use this to hold small wood pieces for drilling.What makes this vise more useful than the typical bolt-down style is the squared-off sides. It allows quick alignment of workpieces in a variety of situations. For example I can lay a block in flat, then tilt the vice up on it’s side, and be assured I’m going to drill a hole perpendicular to the end. You may also slide the vice along a fence when chain drilling a series of holes at the same offset. The precision machining and squareness are what make this possible.The perfectly smooth jaws make it possible to securely hold wood without leaving marks in it.With it’s 9.5 pound weight I rarely need to fasten it to the drill press table in use, as I can safely drill most holes (even in metal) holding it with just my hand. If I do need to fasten it to the table I use a couple of long reach clamps on the flat surfaces of the vice.With one small exception the vice appears to be accurately machined as promised (see dislikes). It’s certainly true enough for most of the work I do.I jotted down some of the specifications and measurements of this vice on a piece of cardboard, and will post them as a photo.What’s not to like? A couple of things:The steel jaws were slightly wider than the vise body, and this made it wobble when set on it’s side. I scribed a line to mark the excess, removed the jaws and filed them true. It only took a few minutes, but considering this is advertised as being accurately machined I was a little disappointed.I wish the handle that controls the jaws was shorter. When the vice is fastened down to the table, you need to slide the handle back and forth as it’s turned to keep it from hitting. I may shorten it someday, or replace it with a knob. That would make adjustments much quicker, but of course the leverage would be less.These are minor complaints, I considered deducting a star for having to adjust the jaws, but that seems overly harsh considering this is such a nicely machined vise. Besides anyone buying a metal-working vise shouldn’t find it too much trouble to apply a few swipe s of a file to the jaws :-).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HTZ8RR3PKPY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009E0E7C4#wasThisHelpful","R2HTZ8RR3PKPY3","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many Bosch blades fit on my Fein 350Q without needing this adapter. So why did I buy it?1. Bosch blades can only be mounted in 4 positions, at 90 degree angles (0, 90, …). Most of the time this is good enough, but sometimes more finesse is needed.2. This allows Bosch blades to mount in 12 positions, at 30 degree angles (0, 30, 60, 90, …).3. Other blades, that are compatible with the Bosch OIS standard should also fit (although I haven’t tried this - so far I’ve only used Fein and Bosch blades).This little plate is accurately built. It fits my Fein MM 350Q perfectly.The only drawback to it is that it makes blade mounting and rotating a bit more clumsy than otherwise, since you’ve got two things to line up rather than just a single blade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLONWA1MLCDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KW15PS#wasThisHelpful","R3VLONWA1MLCDK","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review of Vaughan B215L SuperBar, 21-Inch LongI bought a cheap 15 inch knock-off of this tool from Harbor Freight a few years ago just to see if this form of pry bar would be useful to me. It has been.With a big siding-removal project in the works I decided to invest in a better quality version, and get something just a bit longer. Turns out it was a very good decision. The quality of this tool is far superior to the HF knock-off. As another reviewer mentioned, the ends and nail pulling slot are nicely ground. Seems like it's made with higher quality steel as well, since this 21 inch bar is not much heavier than the knock-off even though it's 40% longer. It's a very good size and weight for removal of plastic siding, easy to carry with me up and down the ladder all day. Quite good at nail pulling, although there are specialized nail pullers available that will do a better job in really tough situations.Helpful tip: I hang this bar from my work belt using a small steel hook (riveted to the right side of the belt), to keep my hands free for other tasks (like holding on to the the ladder :-) ). So far it's worked like a charm, the bar has not fallen off once in may weeks of use.Having experienced the quality difference between this well made tool (USA) and the Asian knock-off I would buy the Vaughan again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFFZ34EL6O79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IGHKC#wasThisHelpful","R2YFFZ34EL6O79","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suspect Mr. Kirby is a disciple of Stunk and White (The Elements of Style). He explains the wood working router, it's uses and limitations, in a clear, direct, and brief manner. Rather than giving long-winded, highly detailed descriptions of specific jigs he focuses on general principals that can be applied to solve many problems. This style can be upsetting for those who are used to more traditional wood working books that give detailed plans complete with materials lists and measurements making it possible to saw, drill, and assemble jigs with minimal thinking required of the reader (if you prefer this style of book, I recommend Bill Hylton's excellent works).I learned a great deal from Mr. Kirby's book, and because of the general nature of his ideas I found I have been able to apply his techniques in other areas of craft as well (such as quickly assembling simple jigs for construction purposes, which are rather different from the fine work the book covers).Mr. Kirby is clearly a master of his craft. The reader willing to invest the extra effort to carefully ponder this text will be richly rewarded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKQLJ6O1DZG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0964399970#wasThisHelpful","RQKQLJ6O1DZG9","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have read the excellent book ""Understanding Wood"" by Bruce Hoadley you know why you need a moisture meter.Wood expands or contracts depending on ambient moisture levels. Mr. Hoadley shows you how to calculate how much your wood will ""move"" in response to this, but to do so you must first know the initial moisture level in your wood. (The calculations are not complicated, by the way.)If you are installing siding, laying down a wood floor, building furniture, determining how much the wall height of your new log cabin will change, or simply verifying your toilet gasket is not leaking, a wood meter can help. Even construction carpenters can make use of thisgadget - for example to determine how much a newly framed building will shrink, which can be useful when applying siding, especially if it is more than a single story. The uses are limited only by your knowledge or wood, and your applications.I've owned the Delmhorst J-lite for about 2-1/2 years, and am very pleased with it. Although I use it less than I thought I would, most every time I do use it, it pays for itself all over again. For example, last year I installed $1,400 worth of pine board inside my house. Measuring  the moisture of the existing interior wood, then comparingit to the moisture of the pine, it was easy to see that the pine would contract after installation (and using Hoadley's formula, to compute the magnitude of the changes - in this case the wood was more moist than the existing wood in my house, so I knew that it was going to shrink by about 1/16, so I took care to jamb the tongue and groove planks tightly together. Had the situation been the reverse, I would have left a slight gap between the planks.)Installing flooring, a moisture meter allows you know exactly when your wood planks have acclimated to the moisture in your home. There are many rules of thumb for this ranging from a few weeks to months, but this is unnecessary (and sometimes quite absurd) if your planks arrive at the correct moisture level to begin with.Back to the Delmhorst. What I like about it is:o it is sturdy, and well builto the readouts are reasonably simple and easy to understand.o the battery lasts a very long time.o comes with a spare set of pins, which I have not yet needed to use.o fits the hand well, comfortable.o comes in a nice blow molded plastic caseo provides a chart to correct for particular species and temperature, but this is typically not necessary unless you are a stickler for extreme accuracy.o can test more than just wood by giving a relative reading on plywood, OSB, MDF etc (that is to say the percentage reading may not be correct, but if you compare the OSB in your bathroom floor to another OSB sample it will show you which is wetter/dryer, which can be quite useful).The only negative that I can think of is that it requires a 9 volt battery. It could be a little more convenient if it took AA batteries.In conclusion, this is a well made meter, seems to give accurate and consistent results. It's usefulness depends on your willingness to learn about wood and it's reaction to moisture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6AIXGJ1FHN1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000224D4#wasThisHelpful","R6AIXGJ1FHN1F","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned this chuck for a few years now, and am very pleased with it.It is very well made. With a little practice it is a slick, quick, sturdy chuck.If my memory serves me correctly, this item is intended to be used with an IMPACT DRIVER.To load a bit properly requires the following steps:1. insert the bit and loosely tighten the chuck by hand2. wrap you hand around the chuck, grasp it medium tight and power up your impact driver. This locks the bit securely in the chuck and is essential to proper operation.3. Drill and drive to your heart's content.I have never had any slippage problems when using the above technique.If you use this chuck enough to develop some skill you can often save sometime by performing  steps 1 & 2 together using the spin from your impact driver.To remove the bit perform step 2 with your impact driver running in reverse.I suspect that the folks who are having problems with bit slippage or removal are not using this chuck with an impact driver, or not following the instructions provided.Although not intended for use with a drill, I find I can do so by setting the clutch to just the right level so that it clicks madly while I grasp the chuck (see step 2) to provide some sort of impact-like force (set your drill to the highest speed possible for this step).Hope this helps clarify things a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P6IG5FVTZH76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NDDJO8#wasThisHelpful","R3P6IG5FVTZH76","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned this saw for 2-1/2 years, and have come to find its unique capabilities indispensable.Having said that, I can understand why some people would have problems with this tool - it is not for everyone. All battery powered tools must compromise between power, size and weight in order to achieve freedom from a 120V cord.  This one is no different. It is a very small, very light tool. Its blade spins slower than other battery powered circular saws. Temper your expectations accordingly, expect it to cut at a relaxed rate, and you will be satisfied  with it's performance. Assume it should be able to cut as quickly as a saw weighing 3 times as much, and you will be disappointed.I do a lot of woodwork and home renovation. I own many professional quality tools including a total of 4 circular saws. Two are 120 volt models, and two are battery powered. The other battery saw is an 18 volt Bosch with 6-1/2"" blade.What I like about the 5094D saw:o It is lighter and smaller by far than any other circular saw. I easily operate it in one hand and SAFELY make cuts in places where no other saw can go. Situations where it has been especially useful include working overhead, sometimes perched atop a high ladder; working in a cramped crawlspace; removing plywood and OSB sheathing material from the wall of a house, cutting trim and siding material.o It's power to weight ratio, and perhaps more importantly power-to-saw-kerf ratio is far superior to most, if not all other battery powered saws. While my 18V Bosch sometimes stalls during heavy cuts, this little Makita has never, ever stalled. Like any circular saw, it will kick back if mishandled, however the result if much less forceful, and hence less dangerous which is important when working overhead or on a ladder.o Low noise level. By far the quietest circular saw I own. No hearing protection is required when using this little saw (the only exception is that sometimes the material being cut may make a racket, but it does not happen often).o Clean. Because the kerf is so tiny, this saw generates far less dust than any other power saw. The low speed of the blade ensures that little of it is blown into the air. I estimate more than ninety percent of the wood dust remains on the workpiece where it can be easily vacuumed or bushed away. When working inside a house this is the cleanest power saw I have, even cleaner than a jig saw or a miter saw connected to a dust collector.o Battery life is very good. You can do a lot of work with this tool before needing a recharge.  Also, the NiMh batteries can be recharged at any time without harm and, if you are in a hurry, they can be partially recharged and used.o Reasonable cutting capability. As mentioned previously, cutting occurs at a relaxed rate (although far  faster than you could do by hand). This saw will readily cross cut one-by boards such as 3/4"" thick fir or pine. It also nicely cuts sheet goods. I have used it extensively on half inch thick OSB, as well as fir, pressure treated and Baltic birch plywood (Baltic birch is essentially solid hardwood). I've used it less often on thicker sheet goods but it certainly does cut 3/4"" thick stock, although a bit more slowly than the half inch stuff. As with all circular saws, the underside cuts very cleanly, with the only tear out on the top side (although the tiny kerf limits this to an acceptable level for most work - use masking tape or other methods if required).o Tiny diameter blade makes it possible to plunge cut closer to the line than larger blades can. For example if you are cutting half inch thick sheathing a 7-1/4 inch blade will be 5/8"" beyond the point that the 3-3/8 blade will be when you stop the cut. Sorry if this seems obscure - it is difficult to explain without a diagram - perhaps if sketching both diameters it will clarify things. Practically speaking, it means I can use this to make rough cut outs in sheathing or other material where I would normally need a different kind of saw (like a Rotozip, or jig saw).What I do not like about this saw:o While it is ruggedly built, and very durable (like most other Makita tools), the baseplate is simply folded steel. It works, but a solid aluminum alloy baseplate ought to be standard in a saw of this price range. Also the pivot points are not quite as tight as I would like, so there is just a little slop when adjusting the base height or angle.In summary, this is a rugged, useful tool. I know of no other circular saw that can compare to it in terms of size and weight. I use mine often, and would not be without it, especially for construction and installation work.-----------------------------UPDATE, November 27, 2010:Having now owned this saw for about 4-1/2 years I like it even better than when I wrote my first review (I shall try to upgrade my rating from 4 to 5 stars, if amazon allows me to).I have used the saw to cut large quantities of sheet goods (mostly half inch OSB and plywood), situated  on a bench and often attached to a wall. This little saw is wonderful for renovations that involved removal, or alteration of the existing wall sheathing. It's very comfortable to use it while standing on a ladder or in other awkward situations where a heavier, bulkier saw just would not fit.This saw has cut thousands of linear feet of siding material including  inch pine and cedar boards, and  ½ inch Canexel planks (similar to high density fibre board). Once one becomes familiar with the tool, it is easy to consistently make free-hand cuts that are accurate to 1/16 or better (I use a guide when I need a tighter tolerance).The saw has been completely reliable and problem free. The batteries have held up very well: only one  of my three batteries is ""sluggish"", but that is perfectly acceptable considering they are used extensively in the saw, impact driver, drill, and light, often in extreme hot/cold outdoor conditions.Kudo's to the engineers at Makita for designing such a wonderful tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EDHFRQ4VIJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001AGNPU#wasThisHelpful","R26EDHFRQ4VIJJ","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this bit set a few years ago for those rare occasions when I need a bit that's a little longer than normal (pocket holes, etc.). I have used them a few dozen times, only in wood (hard and soft), and mostly in a hand held electric drill - I have been pleased with the results.These are not the highest quality drill bits you can buy, but they are good enough for average work. Considering you get 13 bits for about the price of one or (maybe) two high quality ones, I think these are a pretty good deal.Regarding flexing, I don't think it's possible to make a thin, long bit that won't flex a little, and many of the bits in this set are thin. Whenever possible I try to drill a pilot hole using a standard size bit, and then use the 6"" bit for the remaining depth. This seems to minimize the flexing problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W78Q7KQ6D9KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DD0PS#wasThisHelpful","R2W78Q7KQ6D9KA","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first and only drill holster I have used, so I cannot say how other brands compare. I have owned it for about 6 months.If you frequently use a rechargable drill away from your workshop I think you'll find that any holster is way, way better than having none at all. It's especially valuable if you work from ladders or in awkward places (like a sloping roof where you cannot set things down).Pros:o easily holds my 14.4V drills securely, and is large enough I would expect it to hold much bigger drills (18V and up).o the large hole in the bottom makes it possible to holster a drill with a bit installed, which is extremely helpful when working in difficult places (like my slick metal roof).o a velcro snap makes sure the drill won't fall out while climbing, bending over, and moving about. The snap can be positioned out-of-the-way when not required.o seems like it will last a long time.o being nylon it won't be ruined if exposed to water/rain.Cons:o because it is sized to hold even very large drills, it seems a bit too big when used with smaller drills (say 9.6 and down). It holds them fine, but just has a lot of room to spare.o Workmanship is good, but not exceptional.I was just about to purchase the Dewalt holster when I noticed this Grizzly model appeared to be almost identical while costing much less. So, cheapskate that I am, I took a chance, and bought the Grizzly product. So far I am happy with my purchase - very good value for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277G0R13B7OEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DD4AR#wasThisHelpful","R277G0R13B7OEA","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to make my own pocket hole jigs. Drill a hole into a square hardwood block, cut an appropriate angle off the block, and you've got your jig. This approach gives you maximum flexibility with the angle, hole diameter and stock size. Sometimes, it's the best way to go. However, the downsides to this approach are numerous: you have to think alot (it takes some time to figure out the angle and offset), the wood jig gets sloppy after extended use and must be replaced, you need to drill twice for each hole (one countersink, and one for the screw).Enter the Kreg jig.Pros:o no thinking required (well, not about how to build the jig anyway).o easy to use.o high quality product. This is a very well made jig, built to tight tolerances. I expect it to last for a very long time.o the drill bit is also top quality - if you've only used cheap disount bits you will be very pleasantly surprised to see how this fine Kreg bit performs.o instructions are clear, short, easy to follow.o works as well as advertised. Better than I expected, actually.o great support and product information at the kreg website.Cons:o you are limited to a single angle (about 15 degrees, I seem to recall).o you are limited to a single hole width (3/8"")Overall I am very pleased with this jig. It works well and is surprisingly pleasant to use.I've been using the Kreg screws with this jig and am very pleased with them - they are the same high quality as the jig. You can use other screws but make sure they are self-drilling.I use any one of a number of my shop clamps to hold things in place - they work well. I suspect the kreg clamps would work better but have not tried them, and am not inclined to do so at this time.You will need long reach robertson (square drive) screwdriver (or bit for your power driver). A 3"" square drive bit with an extension will do, but a 6"" bit is best. (These are available here on amazon.com, and possibly at your local hardware store.)One last thing. Used appropriately pocket holes can be quite strong and durable, whether done with a home-made jig or the kreg.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1JS7KS6TX8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00065WPP2#wasThisHelpful","RA1JS7KS6TX8A","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For under 20 bucks, this keyboard is a very nice upgrade to the heavily value-engineered keyboard that comes with most computers. (In my case a Dell Quiet-key. It's actually a bit better than most stock keyboards, but still has shortcomings which I won't get into since this is a review of the Microsoft product).Pros:o keys have a nice ""feel"". Light touch, low travel, quiet.o although this is an ergonomic keyboard, the differences in layout and spacing are minor and easy to adjust to, yet they still offer an improvement in typing comfort.o nice spacebar, slightly deeper than standard keyboards, is easy to reach.o reasonable price for a this quality of keyboard.Cons:o size: the width is identical to my Dell Quietkey, depth is about 1 inch greater, to accomodate the extra browser-specific buttons which I don't use. If the extra buttons were generic and user programmable this item would be in the Pros category.Disclaimer - taste in input devices is highly subjective. What works wonderfully for one person can be a nightmare for another. I like this keyboard and find it more comfortable to use than a standard layout.

"It takes a little fiddling to adjust the double blades so that the follower takes just a tiny bit more wood than the front one does.

"I've had this tool for about 3 months, and used it on one major project, recovering valuable wood from some old upholstered chairs.In short, it works well, even better than I expected for such an inexpensive device. Used according to the directions it finds nails easily, and if your thorough, will even find skinny little upholstery staples.The device seems well made, I expect it will last a long time.I estimate it's already paid for itself in a single project when I compare it's cost to that of planer, router and saw blades that would otherwise have been damaged.If you work with reclaimed wood you probably need one of these (or the more expensive model if you do lot's of reclaimation).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UD3HGJHTOCDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005NMUO#wasThisHelpful","R1UD3HGJHTOCDS","A2CACLOQB5F7YU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CACLOQB5F7YU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think this would have been a book that I would have liked a lot when I was younger. There's a lot of action and suspense, and it's overall a pretty entertaining read. I'm seeing it labeled as a children's book, but personally I think that it would work better in the young adult genre, because there are a lot of smart explanations and science bits that might be a bit off putting to a younger reader.This book is a relatively short one at about 200 or so pages, but it's not necessarily a quick reading. The beginning chapters were a bit slow moving and rough for me. I'm the first one to admit that I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to science and math. While I appreciated that the author tried to take the time to explain the background information and science behind the story's adventures, it took me a while to get through it. I'm glad that I stuck through to read the rest of it, but I can see people setting it down right away.Once you get past that, the story picks up and is super fun. Both main characters are extremely likable and crazy smart. This book takes the fantasy aspect of magic and blends it well with fact-based science. I can see kids and young adults who love science picking this up and loving it, in the same vein as the Artemis Fowl books.Unrelated to the novel itself, I really like the cover for this. It's quirky and fun, just like the book inside of it. It's eye-catching and I gotta say, I love the flamingo.This book is worth reading, and I think science kids will like it a lot more than I did. The beginning's a bit rough, but if you stick through, you're rewarded with a fun magic adventure.I received this book in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ASTR57XVSID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWRF0VA#wasThisHelpful","R39ASTR57XVSID","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no secret by this point that I love food. I especially love learning about American cuisines, and the Appalachian region is one that I knew next to nothing about. Thanks to Eating Appalachia I can proudly say I learned a lot more!I should start out by saying that this book isn't a cookbook. It does feature some recipes, but it is way more informative about the region and the local ingredients than it is a list of things to make. This is more for those who are interested in immersing themselves completely by studying, learning, and cooking all at the same time.The book starts with a handy dandy little map of what is considered to be ""Appalachia"" as well as a pretty lengthy introduction to American ingredients. It's divided into sections: Albany, Ohio; Richwood, West Virginia; Prestonburg, Kentucky; Cairo, West Virginia; Cherokee, North Carolina; Colfax, North Carolina, and the epilogue.This book is really vibrant. That is, each section is filled with nice little stories about life in that particular area of the United States. There's also a ton of information about some ingredients that are used here in the USA but are not necessarily well known about. For example, I learned a lot about the pawpaw fruit, which to be honest I only knew about from ""The Jungle Book"" cartoon. I really learned a lot more than I expected, which is pretty cool.Each recipe that is included has a little description. The preparations are pretty short, and are written in paragraphs instead of steps which I imagine could get a bit confusing after awhile. This book doesn't just include recipes for food, but drinks such as ""Pawpaw Whiskey Sours"" as well. I really liked that drinks were included. There's also plenty of pictures!Some of the recipes that I'd most like to try include Pan-Fried Squirrel with Squirrel Gravy, Chianti-Braised Elk Stew, and Seared Scallops in a Pawpaw Buerre Blanc.I'd recommend this to food lovers, those looking for a slice of Americana, or just looking for a few unique recipes.I received a copy in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G37WNQ3YBT2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XGX2JRK#wasThisHelpful","R2G37WNQ3YBT2Y","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cookbook really starts out strong. There is a really big introduction section that introduces what you should have in your pantry, and the gear you might need to use throughout the recipes in the book. There's also a really big ending section, that contains all the recipes that the ""main"" recipes used- things such as sauces and cheeses. While I love that even these aspects were made for scratch, I didn't really like that they were all scooted together at the end of the book, instead of being on the following page or something.This book is sorted into chapters according to meal/course: Breads & Breakfast, Lunch, Soups Starters and Snacks, Suppers, Vegetables and Sides, and Sweet Treats & Sips. I liked this way of organizing things, because it makes it easier to find what you need. I also really appreciated that this cookbook included drink recipes. (That's an under-appreciated section in cookbooks, in my humble opinion.)The book contains nice little notes and tips on techniques or ingredients, which were helpful and a nice touch to the recipes. There's also a fair share of stories that give the book a more personal feel to it. The steps are in small paragraphs as opposed to shorter, numbered steps.There's a nice variety of cultures present here, ranging everywhere from Greek to Vietnamese to African. This is widely reflected in the dishes themselves, which range from basics like lemon chicken to dishes with bold Indian spices. Some of the dishes in this cookbook are very, very simple. But some of them are pretty complicated and have long ingredient lists. This isn't a bad thing, it's just less likely I'm going to have all of those things on hand to cook on a whim. On the same note, there are some ingredients here that are rather hard to get a hold of, at least near me, such as za'atar and halloumi. I'm sure they're wonderful to cook with, but it's definitely not something I currently can run to the store and fetch. The pictures that are in this book are gorgeous, but there's not really enough of them for my liking. Photos are a key element to whether or not I purchase a cookbook; I like knowing what I'm supposed to aiming for.Some of the dishes I'd most like to prepare from this cookbook include Dipper Eggs with Cheese-Fried Toast Soldiers, Hard Cider Gougeres, Walnut Cherry Oat Butter Tart Pie, and Roasted Grapes with Sweet Labneh.Overall, this is a pretty good cookbook. I think both beginners and more experienced cooks can benefit from it, but be prepared for ingredient lists that you might not necessarily be used to.I received a copy in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MRWOEAL8KY9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449016307#wasThisHelpful","R3MRWOEAL8KY9Z","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So first, I'd like to put out a disclaimer about my reading of this parody: I haven't read Gone Girl. The thriller/mystery genre isn't really my bag, so I didn't really have an interest in it. Then I got excited when I found out it was being made into a movie, because I could skip the book and just watch that (I know, I know. I'm a terrible reader.) Then I found out that the movie starred Ben Affleck, an actor whom I don't enjoy in the least. So I decided not to watch this either. Then I stumbled across the parody, chuckled at the title, and had to give it a go.As someone who is unfamiliar with the original book Gone Girl, I thought this was a pretty funny story. The characters were really over-written and dramatic, and the narration was snarky. I snickered aloud more than once throughout the course of the book. While I know these characters are based on the ones from Gone Girl, I honestly have read quite a few books where Lookner's version of Amy was how I viewed the main female character: obsessed with her looks and image, really shallow, boring, and altogether unlikable. And on top of that, though Nick too is written with a sense of humor, and is not without his own problems, you kind of start to like him. Maybe I should give Ben's onscreen version a try after all.This is a pretty quick read at 160 paperback pages, and it didn't take me very long to get through it all. If you have actually read Gone Girl I think you'll feel more strongly about this parody version; either you'll be angry that he satirized a book you loved, or you'll get a laugh or two at the expense of a book you didn't enjoy. As a neutral reader, that's how I feel- neutral. It was funny, but not something that I'll probably read again (that is, unless I read Gone Girl and come back to this). I think those who read it will enjoy it more or less than me, depending on how you liked it. I'd also recommend it to people who enjoy works like Nightlight by The Harvard Lampoon.I received this book through the Goodreads Firstreads program in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNODQDNJ6MFND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692297839#wasThisHelpful","RNODQDNJ6MFND","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has so many things that I love, all rolled into one little book. Contemporary romance? Check. Young adult? Check. Hockey? Triple check. I knew I had to read this one the moment I saw the cover (I know, I know). I'm glad that the story inside is just as cute as the cover represents it to be.Center Ice is a really sweet book. We meet Karen and Tyler, who tell their story from both sides, as the book flips between each of their points of view. They're absolutely adorable together, and I enjoyed every minute of watching them fall deeper in love. Tyler is a hockey player with NHL goals in mind, and I loved him. Karen, well, I didn't like her much as her own character. She did a lot of things that made me sigh, and I found it hard to connect with her. That said, I liked her with Tyler as a couple, so I wasn't horridly put off by it while reading. I appreciated the overall depth of the characters- this book is more than just a sweet romance. There's a lot of other issues working here such as reputations, family struggles, and pressures for perfection. This made the book a lot more realistic for me, and I appreciated it.I absolutely adore hockey (Go Blackhawks!) so I really liked that it was a focal point of this book. I don't just mean that in regards to Tyler being a stellar, NHL bound player in the plot of the book. The author seems really well researched on the sport, it sounded like it was written by someone familiar with hockey, not someone just using it as a plot device. There was slang and details that I really enjoyed.I think that this is a really good romance for fans of hockey or sports themed romances, as well as contemporary romance. I'd place it somewhere between YA and NA for age range. I'm told that this is the first book in a series, and though I had some issues with Center Ice I would definitely continue on with the next book in the series.I received my copy in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJM7AJ2PHCCZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPXAFQA#wasThisHelpful","RJM7AJ2PHCCZC","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I waited a long while to write this review. All the Rage is a very intense book to read, and I needed some time (a few weeks, actually) to decompress everything long enough to write a coherent opinion on it.First, I'd like to say that this book's message is so damn important. I think it's crazy that every day when I get on Facebook, there's a new trending story of some teen rape/bullying/sexting case. It's horrifying. Books with themes as deep as the ones found in this book are often close to my heart, because I have experienced them first hand. These are books that need writing, because it is still happening across the country and the world. It's worth reading. End of.The writing itself is beautiful. Though I can name other books Summers has written, and I've come across her name often on the internet, this is the first time I've ever read anything written by her. She has a great ability to describe human emotion in ways that I'm not sure that I could give a voice. It's beautiful and haunting at the same, almost hollow. It was an almost soothing sense of dread and darkness, which was an odd sensation but a lovely one as a reader (that might make no sense to some of you- sorry about that).That said, the timing in this book left me puzzled. I wasn't always entirely sure where in the timeline I was, and that made it a bit hard to focus on what was happening. I had all of the puzzle pieces, but struggled at times to put them together into a bigger picture.The characters left me divided. I felt for Romy, truly, and I wanted her to get all the things that she needed and wanted to calm her mind and restore her life. Because she was so turbulent of a character, my own feelings for her matched. Sometimes she left me confused, and sometimes I really couldn't connect to her. Other times I felt like she was sharing thoughts I've had personally, verbatim. The adults, don't get me started. They're accurate enough- the not listening, the lying, the small town politics. That is where I felt all the rage. I wanted to punch some of them (not unlike the adults in other books on similar topics I've read lately). The romance aspect didn't really add anything to me, but I'm sure there are others who will disagree with me.In short, this book left me torn. And honestly, I think it was meant to. It's a book that's hard to swallow and slow to read, because some pretty bad themes and actions are within its pages. It is a book that demands more thought and reflection after it's been read. As I mentioned before, I think it's definitely a book that is worth reading, even though I didn't always follow or connect to it in the best way. Be warned, rape and bullying are main themes in this book, so tread with caution if you are sensitive to them. If you benefited from reading books such as Some Boys or The S-Word, you might want to give this one a go.I received a copy in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFK6ZLIYY1Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NS316MW#wasThisHelpful","R3CFK6ZLIYY1Z0","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a firm believer that your sex life can always be better. For the most part, I'm pretty satisfied with my sex life, but I mean there is always room for improvement. So when I got asked if I wanted to read Better Sex in No Time, I was excited to say yes. I think this book can help any couple improve, even if a little, no matter how long you've been together.It's important to start out by saying that my partner is a female. This book is written primarily for heterosexual couples- which is in no way a complaint. I found that it was easy to pick and choose the physical things that would work for females, and almost all of the romance aspects are still applicable, regardless of gender. I'm not sure how it plays out for gay men, but for lesbians, there's still plenty of tips in here for you!The book is divided into four big sections. Part one is ""Seduction"". Part two is ""Foreplay"". Part three is ""Union"" and part four is Spice. I appreciated that this book was chunked in this way, because it makes it easy to focus on the parts that you know that your relationship may be lacking in. There's smaller sections in each part, narrowing the focus even further.There's a lot of really good tips and advice in this book. There are some really nice (and non-explicit) photographs that help keep the romantic/sensual vibe about the book. There are also helpful illustrations throughout the book that help to explain what the text is trying to convey. Things such as positions or ways to move your fingers, things like that, become more clear when you look at the illustrations. I was a little bit worried when I found out that it was an illustrated book, but they really do add to the advice.Honestly, I think that this book is perfect for any couple (over 18, blah blah). It's full of advice for any part of your sex life that may be struggling, from adding some kinky fun to the mix, or communication and intimacy problems. It's a book that will happily find a home on my sexuality shelf for reference in the future.I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI78RSDWJ7FJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627780718#wasThisHelpful","RI78RSDWJ7FJQ","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cortney Pearson is one of those authors whose name I see all over the blogosphere, but whose books I had never read. I was excited to get a chance to read Such a Secret Place for the review tour. I'm a big fan of both fantasy and young adult literature, so I thought this would be up my alley. All in all, this was a decent read.I wasn't really a big fan of the main character throughout the novel, but I didn't hate her either- I still was rooting for her throughout the book. It just got to some points where she really, really annoyed me. It was kind of like that one friend that we all have that you love dearly but just want to shoosh them sometimes. Most of the time, I was able to push this aside to focus on other aspects of the book, such as the awesome world building. I really liked the way that magic was integrated throughout both the world that Pearson created as well as the plot of the story. I liked that there wasn't really instalove, though there is a romantic kindling. I adore Talon, and I can't wait to read more of him in the next book in the series.This book is rather complicated at times, but that's part of why I liked it. I think that's part of what I like about fantasy in general- the intricacies of a new world, and of the new creations or races or what have you that take up that world. The writing got a bit flowery for my liking in some parts, but overall I thought Pearson was really well detailed. It was easy to get lost in the story and swept up in Ambry's adventures.Unrelated to the content of the book, I also really like the cover design. I think it's a fair reflection of the story within, and it'd catch my eye on a display.I'd recommend this to fans of YA fantasy, especially ones that feature magic as a key part of the plot. While this wasn't a perfect read for me, I enjoyed it well enough and I would definitely consider picking up the next book to read more about Talon and Ambry. The strongest element to this story is the world building, which I absolutely loved.I received this book in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSYL1LSEGI9BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508700966#wasThisHelpful","RSYL1LSEGI9BF","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book through the Goodreads Firstreads program in exchange for my honest review.I love fantasy books. That being said, I especially love fantasy books that contain elves. They're my favorite race/creature from fantasy, and I'm a sucker for any book that features them. That's why I was so excited to read this book, which is actually more of a short story at 70 pages.There was definitely potential here. I could see where the author was trying to go, and the plot itself wasn't bad. I liked the ideas in regards to magic and world building that the author gave. It had all the elements that make fantasy great to me: a little companion, magic, a fairy king, elves, and a mountain adventure.Unfortunately, this book is in need of some serious editing. There were quite a few grammatical mistakes that made it a bit rough to get through. Plus, when the story was technically correct in its writing, the sentences were short and choppy, lacking the long, detailed flow that I look for in a fantasy tale.Like I said before, I think there is definite potential here. Maybe it just needs editing, or maybe it would be better reworked into a full length novel. I'm not entirely sure. I see good in this story, and I would happily read it again and edit my review if it is ever republished/re-edited.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZV7W1SV4BHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499361041#wasThisHelpful","R2CZV7W1SV4BHL","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't too sure what to expect going into Between the Lines. But I have got to say that this is a perfect book for young teen girls.What I perhaps liked most about this book is the idea that it's based on a true friendship between two white girls and a black girl. This story takes place during the aftermath of the Detroit Riots in 1967, a time when racial tensions were running high (to say the least). I think it's cool that there's real aspects tied in with the fiction. The author and her friends serve as the real life influences for this story, and like Hattie the riots started on her birthday. I think it's awesome that she was able to translate her story to a book for younger girls.I also liked that I could tell that this book was written by a teacher. The main character, Hattie, wants to be a writer when she grows up. Because she wants to be a writer, she is always working on her vocabulary and handwriting. I think this was a subtle way to introduce new words to young readers, without making it ""too educational"" or too much information dumping at once. In fact, this carried over to the historical aspects too. It felt like a story, even though these events happened in real life, at least in some capacity. It's educational without coming off as an essay or textbook, and I think that's a great note.The characters were distinct and likable. Hattie is the first character we meet, a white ten year old girl who has to move from her home to a new neighborhood, where she will attend a public school (instead of a private Catholic school) for the first time in her life. Beverly Jo is a black girl, the first one that Hattie has ever had. Crackers is an adventurous, gutsy, more tomboyish character. Together they are an awesome trio that stands strong, even in a society that tells them that they shouldn't be friends.I think this book is a great read for girls in the junior high school age bracket, so about 10-13 years old. It brings up important issues like standing up for what you believe in, fighting for equality, and the importance of friendship. It is reminiscent of the American Girl series books, but a bit thicker in length and a bit more detailed and in depth.I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPL0JP05G5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRAHTUS#wasThisHelpful","R3RPL0JP05G5R","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The third book in Llewellyn's new ""Sabbat Essentials"" is Midsummer. Midsummer, or Litha, is one of the four sun-associated holidays on the Wheel of the Year, and is otherwise known as the summer equinox. This is the day where the sun shines the longest. Like its predecessors, this reference book is in a very easy navigate format, with just six simple chapters: Old Ways, New Ways, Spells & Divination, Recipes & Crafts, Prayers & Invocations, and Rituals of Celebration.The Old Ways section of this books goes discusses the history of the holiday and how it was celebrated by different cultures, including communicating with fairies and bonfires. The New Ways section that follows includes how to celebrate in a modern setting, whether you're out in the country or in a big city, and also includes descriptions of different pagan paths and how they may celebrate Midsummer.There are two chapters, Spells & Divination and Prayers & Invocations, that discuss how to pray, meditate, and cast spells. Some of the ones included in Midsummer include Modern Tarot Divination as well as Herbal Spells and Charms. The following chapter has to do with recipes and crafts, and includes things such as Ale for the Gods Bread, Cherries Jubilation Fruit Soup, Viking Boats, and Cinnamon Brooms. These are easy to follow instructions that even beginners and those who aren't so crafty (like myself) can follow along. There's also a list of rituals, additional readings, and a cheat sheet for facts about the sabbat.This book blends in well with the rest in its series, and is something I'd recommend more to new pagans than old practitioners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q7G1XJ2BNN1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738741825#wasThisHelpful","R1Q7G1XJ2BNN1M","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second book in Llewellyn's Sabbat Essentials series is Beltane by Melanie Marquis. Beltane is generally thought of as the first day of summer on the pagan calendar. Like the first book, this book is in a very easy navigate format, with just six simple chapters: Old Ways, New Ways, Spells & Divination, Recipes & Crafts, Prayers & Invocations, and Rituals of Celebration.In the first chapter, entitled ""Old Ways"", this book introduces and explores the history of the holiday of Beltane. It talks about May Day and things such as the Maypole that are even still used in modern spring and summer celebrations. The ""New Ways"" chapter explains modern rituals, and talks about how different paths of pagans, from Heathens to Wiccans, celebrate Beltane. It talks about where it's still celebrated and gives advice on how to celebrate in a modern day lifestyle. It also suggests some activities, such as ways to be creative and how to refresh your life for the new season.Then, there is a chapter called ""Spells & Divination"" that includes spells and other means to help achieve goals during this time of Beltane. These include the Sun and Citrine Spell for Energy and Purification and Fortunetelling with Eggs and Bannocks. There are good steps to follow to help you through it, which is good if you're a beginner to paganism. This chapter also includes a nice rundown of the basics of tarot cards. This chapter partners well with the chapter on prayer. The following chapter includes recipes and crafts, such as Blessed Lemon Custard, Supercharged Sun Cakes, and a Beltane Floral Crown. There are well detailed, step-by-step instructions for all of these, and there's a nice variety to the recipes.There is a final chapter for Rituals of Celebration. These include fully detailed rituals from prayers to actions to meditations for the solitary practitioner, a handfast union, and a group ritual too. There's also additional reading, and a cheat sheet of sorts for symbols and things associated with Beltane.This is a great continuation in this series that I think is best suited to beginners of the craft.

"Ostara is the first of the Llewellyn's Sabbat Essentials that I received to review. This reference book is in a very easy navigate format, with just six simple chapters: Old Ways, New Ways, Spells & Divination, Recipes & Crafts, Prayers & Invocations, and Rituals of Celebration.The first section, ""Old Ways"", explains the historical context and more anciently tied traditions of the sabbat. The section of ""New Ways"" offers more modern day ways to connect to the holiday, like gardening or taking walks or meditation. Things that you can do in your daily life, without a lot of difficulty or struggle. It also suggests places to visit and places to go so you're out in the wonderful springtime.The ""Spells & Divination"" chapter contains just that- spells and divination tips and ideas. Some of these include a spell to assist in difficult changes, and a Spring is in the Air Love Attraction Spell. These are written in step by step format, and include lists of the things you will need to follow them. There are also prayers and words to say included. These serve as good jumping off points for beginners to the path. This is expanded on within the ""Prayers and Invocations"" section as well.The ""Recipes and Crafts"" section, again, includes just what you'd think. Some of the recipes included in this book are Mint Lamb Chops and Hot Cross buns. They're short and relatively simple recipes, with the steps written in more of a paragraph format as opposed to a step-by-step list. There are desserts, drinks, and meals for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Crafts include Eggshell Plant Pots and Painted Garden Stones. These are largely family friendly and relatively easy crafts that are a fun way to spend the day. I'm not the craftiest person, so I was happy to see that these are things that (I think) I can actually do.The last chapter, ""Rituals of Celebration"" includes a ritual for a solitary practitioner, one designed for two people, and one designed for a group.All in all, I think this is a great place to start as a beginner, or a relatively quick way to brush up on things if you're not in the regular study habit.

"I was really excited to read this book. I really like books that involve Japanese themes and culture. I also really enjoy fantasy. Plus on top of that, my father was (in his prime) a competitive ice carver. So I thought that this would be one that I loved. I enjoyed it well enough, but overall it was a really average read for me.I really liked the fantasy elements and how they were blended into the story. I also rather liked the writing style. It was very pretty and it flowed well to me, but it seemed a bit displaced. This book is for children, and the main character is a child as well. It came off as very adult- I don't know any children who would think or speak like this.This book was clearly written as a moral story, which is fine. But for me, this whole moral of being selfless was waaaay too prominent. It was blunt and forced in the reading, as opposed to letting the story unwrap the lesson to be learned from the story. It was hammering, to see the point of the story get across.The cover is absolutely gorgeous as well, and I think it is a fairly good representation of the story within its pages.This wasn't a bad book by any means, but it's not one that I'd read again. I don't have children, so I can't be a proper judge of how this story is received, but I think it may lend itself well to being read aloud and not for them to read on their own.I received a copy in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1O2D2QOVV22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784621889#wasThisHelpful","R1R1O2D2QOVV22","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, I think this is a great concept for a book. Most of the books that I get published by Cleis Press are fictional short stories, but this book isn't that kind of writing. This is a collection of scholarly articles, each written under the blanketed category of ""sex"". I'm currently in college and I'm getting a minor in Sexuality Studies. I can say with certainty that I will be citing at least some of these articles in my research in the future as I earn my degree.I'm not going to lay out all thirty-ish essays that are featured in this book (buy it and read it!), but I will talk briefly about some of the essays that I found the most interesting. One of these is entitled ""I Am the Blogger Who Allegedly 'Complicated' the Steubenville Gang Rape Case- and I Wouldn't Change a Thing"" written by Alexandria Goddard. As the title suggests, this as an article that reflects on the awful rape case that happened a few years ago, written by a blogger who had captured screenshots and tweets and posted them to spread some light on the situation of just how bad the case was. I'm pretty sure that there's not an adult or teenage American who hasn't heard of this case. It's fascinating to see the shitstorm unfold from such a perspective as Alexandria's, who was both praised and looked down on for her posting of content that the teens had willingly posted (rather stupidly) themselves to social media. I digress. Another essay that I found really interesting is called ""When I Was a Birthday Present for an Eighty-Two-Year-Old Grandmother"" by David Henry Sterry. Again, the title kind of sums it up, it's about the author's job, where he was hired as an escort for a woman's birthday. It's an interesting view of things, and you get an emotional and almost satisfaction hearing his story.This book is enlightening and brings a lot of unique voices to the table. It's definitely worth giving a read if you at all have sex- er go, all of you adults should read it. It's insightful and informative, and very smartly done. It's my understanding that this is the first edition of this, implying that there will be more. I definitely hope that's the case, because I think it fills a need that's lacking in modern publication.I received this book in exchange for my honest opinions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDJVI7V2W6IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627780866#wasThisHelpful","R1NDJVI7V2W6IS","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit it to you here, the reasons why I picked this book up are more personal than anything. My girlfriend's name is in fact Emily H. I took it as a sign to read this one. In short, it's a cute, quick read that I think younger audiences than me would appreciate more.One of the big things that this book has going for it is the blending of realistic fiction and fantasy. It's really detailed and well-written as a realistic fiction. That is, there's a girl who is missing and a mystery to solve. Likewise, there's a clique-ish cast of girls who are mean bullies. It's a very real situation to believe, on the surface.But then there's Raine. Raine has these ""sparkles"" or little touches that were passed on through her family that allow her to see pieces of the past. She wants to use her gift for the greater good in order to help find out for once and for all what happened to Emily. This gift is a cool touch, but is one that I feel isn't very well explained. I got the overall concept and it works on some level, but lacked a bit of information. Regardless, it was this gift that gave this story a nice fantastical pop.There's also a little bit of romance, but I appreciated that it wasn't a main focus of the plot. It was sweet to read about though.This book tackles a lot, sometimes more than enough at once. Despite that overload, the theme of bullying in this book is an important and a clear one. It's a little sad how many books on bullying have come my way lately, but I understand their importance in the world. I've been Raine's age and it can be a nightmare. I think while it's dealing with tough stuff, the author keeps a good balance of serious and less serious, both of which balance well to create a well-paced, fairly cohesive story.I think that readers that are closer to Raine's age- that is, 8th grade- will really enjoy this one. It's got a well-written, well-paced story that deals with issues like bullying that are prominent throughout junior high. It has a nice blend of relatability and paranormal aspects, with a touch of romance and cuteness.I was provided a copy in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZR9YR566D47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBGVI#wasThisHelpful","R3GZR9YR566D47","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5/5First of all, I have to say how much I absolutely love this idea. I'm a big fan of yoga myself and I think it's great that there exists a picture book series for young kids (and adults too!) to get started practicing it at a young age while maintaining a fun and safe atmosphere. This isn't a book I'd ever noticed missing in my life, but I can say that now that I know it exists, it's one that I'd definitely recommend to my parent friends and relatives who have small children.Let's start with the fundamentals: this is a practical but easy to use book from an adult standpoint. At the end of the book, there's a little guide that goes into a bit more depth about how each of the poses demonstrated throughout the story should be done, as well as tips for staying safe while doing them, breathing control, and communication with the kids.Now for the story part of the book. What's most striking to me about this book is the illustrations. They are simply stunning. They have bright, vivid colors that are perfect for springtime, and have this cool textured/layered look to them that I really enjoy. The illustrations of Rachel serve duel purposes. First, they highlight the story of Rachel's lovely spring day in the garden with her dog. Also, each time that Rachel is on the page, she is in a new yoga position. On each of these new pages, there is a bubble with the name of the pose as well as a highlighted word in the sentence of the story that best represents that pose. That key word is also correspondent to a color (like the yellow sun). It's a really simple book on the surface, but it teaches so much in a small space. It encourages fitness, imagination, and relaxation while simultaneously teaching the child about yoga and colors while also entertaining them with a story about a bright spring day. It's a pretty neat idea that is really well done, in my opinion.This is a book that I think any yogi, fitness fan, or even parent of a young child would definitely benefit from reading. This is, from my gathered knowledge, the first book of a series with each book representing a different season. I would definitely read more from Giselle Shardlow and can't wait to see the illustrations and poses in the next book.A copy of this book was provided to me in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DJRPWRF8CT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500138495#wasThisHelpful","R35DJRPWRF8CT9","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was born and raised in the Midwest. Illinois, specifically, where even now in my adulthood is where I go to college and where I live. However, for a very brief time, I lived and vacationed in Massachusetts. This book made me homesick for the coast, even though I'm from the heartland. Each of the 57 recipes included in this book sounded absolutely fantastic, and had me wanting to book the next flight to Marblehead.At the front of the book, there's a nice guide on how to best use and handle the ingredients listed throughout this cookbook. This is an especially nifty little note, considering there are a lot of seafood chowders with ingredients that the average home cook probably isn't using each and every night (at least in Illinois).The recipes are very clear and concise, each one having numbered, step-by-step instructions. That makes this a really good book for beginners in the kitchen, because everything is laid out in a really helpful manner. There's also a lot of handy tips throughout this book, such as the 411 on mussels, and how to buy and clean clams. This is information that I wouldn't necessarily know off the bat, so I'm glad it was included. There's also lots of nice anecdotes and memories in this book, making it clear that the author is passionate about what she does. I also rather liked the ""chowder wars"" in this book, where different places claiming a better chowder were discussed.Each recipe also offers salad, side, or dessert pairings that are also found in this book, so the book is kind of a one-stop-shop for all your soup eating needs. There is a surprising amount of variety found in this cookbook, from fish to chicken, from shellfish to beef. There's something in here for everyone, whichever ingredient you may happen to favor. The book is divided by type of meal, so it's fairly easy to navigate to find what you're looking for. There's a lot of yummy looking pictures too, which definitely helps.As I mentioned before, everything in this book sounds awesome. That said, the dishes that I'm most excited to try include Dark and Sticky Candied Gingerbread, Day After Thanksgiving Chowder, and Northwest Salmon Chowder with Leeks and Peas.This book is a great burst of Americana, and I recommend it to any one who loves to eat soups and chowders as much as I do. Because of the detailed steps, I think this book is suitable to both experienced and beginner cooks.I received a copy of this in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19J56K3GH4HWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612123759#wasThisHelpful","R19J56K3GH4HWL","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bracelet is a really cute piece that goes perfectly with the Katy Perry Pearl MEOW necklace. Naturally, I had to buy them both together. This is a fake pearl bracelet with six silver charms on it. Four of them spell the word MEOW, and the ""O"" charm has a diamond in the middle for a little extra glam. Then surrounding the word meow is two silver heart charms. I really like this bracelet, especially when worn with the necklace. My issue is with sizing. I'm an adult, so it's a little bit more snug than I would like. It doesn't really hang lose much, so the charms don't get a fair chance to dangle.

"I adore this necklace. The chain length is adjustable. This is a fake pearl necklace with four silver charms on it, spelling the word ""MEOW"". In the middle of the ""O"" charm, there is a diamond for added bling to the silver and pearls. This is a necklace that I get complimented on all the time when I wear it. The only complaint that I have about this necklace is that some of the little ""o"" rings that keep the charms in place aren't closed all the way, so the ""O"" kept falling off, and the chain fastener kept coming off.

"I love, love, love this phone case. It is just as brightly colored as it appears in the stock photo, with a few gems adorning the back as well. It's made of a soft, silicon-ish material that makes it easy to slide onto the device. I've been using it on an iPhone 5c, and it fits just fine. It's a really adorable accessory that I get complimented on all the time. My suggestion, however, is not to put your phone in your pocket when you have this cover on. Because of the silicon/soft plastic, it is hard to slide it in and out of your pocket, and when you finally get it out it's covered in fuzzies that are a pain to get off. So heed that, and this is a perfect phone case for anyone with a sweet tooth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WEI6RDFLYQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSK2I2C#wasThisHelpful","R10WEI6RDFLYQK","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This smells like summer, in one tiny little wax cube. The cubes themselves are a very pale pastel yellow. They smell like tropical drinks and sun tan lotion, which makes for a nostalgic and familiar summer scent. The scent is strong, without being overpowering.

"This is my absolute favorite ScentSationals scent of wax cubes. The package describes it as ""old time elegance"", and that is completely accurate. This has a very antique smell to it. It's very, very floral and smells of an elegant vintage perfume. It's very nostalgic, and very VERY strong- you only need one cube of it to fill a room or two. It's good year round and not very seasonal, but is a very feminine scent.

"I really like the overall concept of this pairing. The ""Cheers to That"" dual wax cube set includes five cubes of Mango Caipirinha and five cubes of Amaretto Sunset. I really like each of these separately, but together (as intended) I think they're a bit muddled and far too sweet. The Mango Caipirinha cubes are a light orange color and smell like a sweet and strong mango margarita mix. The Amaretto Sunset cubes are a tan color and smell just like amaretto. I much prefer the amaretto scent, but both of them have a nice smell to them. These would be good to use in the summer heat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPH050H12KMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9YN8DY#wasThisHelpful","RTPH050H12KMK","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this scent because who doesn't love the smell of candy? The packaging is bright and enticing, and the cubes themselves are a pastel shade of pink. These cubes are very, very sweet smelling (as candy is) with no distinguishable fruits or notes. The closest scent that I could compare this to would maybe be pink lemonade. I like the smell, and I think it's a great summery burst of nostalgia. However, for me the cubes are just too weak. I used more than one at a time in my warmer, and still couldn't get the intensity that I get with other scents.

Her arms and legs are easily posed, and while she is obviously fragile, she's not quite as delicate as I was expecting. (I mean, still don't give this to a little kid or anything, but you don't have to treat it like it's made of paper). This doll has soft pink hair and stitching over her mouth. Her outfit has a pale pink veil that matches a pink and black party dress with a black tulle flower on the hip, and lacey socks with pink Mary Janes. She comes with a party invitation scroll, and in the signature Living Dead Doll coffin box packaging (which I absolutely adore).

The crystals give an almost-rainbow range of colors of blues, green, yellow, orange and pink.

What I wasn't expecting, when I was taking this out of the box, is that it lights up! The skull's eyes have LED colored lighting, which makes this statue a helluva lot creepier when your mother randomly comes into your room and flips it on without your knowledge.

The application is a bit thinner than a normal lipstick, so if you're filling in full lips it takes a bit more effort than a normal sized lipstick, but it's not a major hindrance. If your lips have a tendency to dry out quickly, I would recommend a light clear gloss over this, as it can dry out. For me, this wasn't a big enough problem for me to stop using it or even for me to like it less. The pigment is strong, and it stays on for hours at a time, even if you're eating or drinking. It might just need a touch up every now and then. It goes on smooth and easy. I'll definitely be buying more lip colors from Lorac in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32J1X5GT41343/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUUF4HG#wasThisHelpful","R32J1X5GT41343","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this primer as a gift, but my surprise was definitely a pleasant one. This product does exactly what it advertises- it gives your skin a healthy, bright, ""just cleaned"" look to it that really does make all the difference when going through my beauty routine. It's oil-free, paraben-free, and fragrance free. It doesn't at all clog the pores, and it really has no scent (something I've been falsely promised before by other brands of cosmetics). You just need a little bit of this primer, so a bottle goes a long way. As someone with sensitive skin, this product doesn't cause any burning, irritation, or break outs. This is a must have for those who want just a bit of help with getting their skin to look healthier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECL4XFI0N3OU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKOU452#wasThisHelpful","R3ECL4XFI0N3OU","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this foundation as a Christmas present, and I cannot be happier. Finding foundation is a fussy thing for me, because I'm so pale. It's really hard to find a ""light"" shade that is light enough. This foundation, in the NP1-Porcelain shade is absolutely perfect for my skin tone. It goes on really smooth and is easy to apply, and lasts for hours without reapplication.

"I got this Hello Kitty eye shadow palette for Christmas, and I'm really happy with it. The top of the palette is a metallic silver design with Hello Kitty, a red bow, and a red, white and blue heard in the corner. The palette itself pulls out like a little drawer with a red fabric bow as a handle. There are 20 solid eye shadows included. The pigment is pretty standard and easy to apply. The top part of the palette pops open to show a cute display of Hello Kitty having a little birthday party, which is absolutely adorable. This is a great gift and a must-have for Hello Kitty collectors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY804PMSKY0OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5UU3HQ#wasThisHelpful","RY804PMSKY0OP","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the dolls that I received as a Christmas present, and I think she is the most unique of the dolls that I have. Avea is part harpy, part centaur. She has the bottom half of a purple horse. On the flank, there are lighter purple skullettes and polka dots. Each leg has a black bracer. She has a black harness with little horse shoes on it, and her tail is held in place with a black tie. The top half is harpy, her skin a lavender color. She has on a teal blouse with a pink and black shirt over it, and the black belt is attached to the harness. She has black and teal riding gloves on, and purple and magenta bracelets on her wrists. Her hair/mane is comprised of different shades of blue and teal. She has a black top hat with a magenta border and feather, that is strapped into place. Her lips are dark purple, and her eye makeup is rainbow colored and looks like butterfly wings. She comes with detachable wings that fade from black to teal. My only complaint is that I have problems getting these wings to stay into place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10BP9KHK68VU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCKF4#wasThisHelpful","R10BP9KHK68VU2","A25SFTHL9SIDSW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25SFTHL9SIDSW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to find a comic book hero inspired line of Monster High dolls, and this doll didn't disappoint. Her purple hair is down, with a pink plastic headband in place that matches the pink ""BAM!"" comic bubble shaped earrings and the pink chain wings that attach to the collar on her neck. Her dress is one piece and is gray, black, and pink with silver trim and a silver skull on the front. Her belt is a wrapped set of a silver ball and chains. Her heeled boots are silver with pink designs, and a pink heel/platform. Her lips are a dark maroon color, and her mask is spray-painted on in a hot pink hue. Her wrists/hands and ankles/feet ombre from the white of her skin to see-through.

"I really enjoy this doll. Her hair is purple and black, and comes groomed and down. My one complaint about this doll is that it becomes a rat's nest very, very quickly. Her eye and lip makeup consist of different shades of purple. Her dress is purple and black with ties up the front, and layered skirts. She has a light purple bracelet on her wrist. Her boots are black, and come to just below her knee. She comes with a cool trophy as well as a coffin shaped movie case.

Her hair is black and orange, down over her shoulders. Her face makeup is blue, gold, and pink in the style of a sugar skull. Her dress is a black halter, with purple trim, and then there's a brightly colored skirt over it. As for accessories, she has a tan belt and matching bracelet, both of which feature tiny skullettes in their designs.

It's a gorgeous baby blue color, but I wasn't expecting it to have glitter in/on it, which gives her a great frozen look to her. Her hair is platinum with streaks of glittery, pink, and blue, and is pulled in a side pony tail. She has light purple eye shadow, which matches her ice crystal earrings and necklace. She has a blue ice crystal belt as well. Her dress has one shoulder strap, and the design is shades of purple, pink, and blue that resemble ice caves. There's a white fur trim along the bottom of the dress.  Her shows match the ice crystal theme, and are heels that are a pearly white. Of course, there is a matching blue icy purse.

"I received this Monster High doll as a Christmas present. I love the color combination on this doll, the hot pink and lime green go together to create a visually stunning doll that this online photo doesn't do justice! Her curls are blended pink and green, and the other sidecut is soft/flocked hot pink hair. This is the first doll I've ever gotten that had a flocked style buzzed hair cut and I think it's awesome. I really love that she's so detailed, that she has vines wrapped around her wrists and calves, and has adorable leaf-shaped ears. This doll comes with a little green seedling inside of a plastic coffee mug.

"Let me say, I was going to pass on the new generation of gaming consoles because, these consoles simply don't match up well with most of the mid-level gaming machines on paper. However, having played every generation of Console from the Atari 2600 to the present, made passing up the chance to buy one on launch day hard to resist. So, I got the email notification that the PS4 was now on sale and I pulled the trigger.First, I'm not a hardcore gamer by any means and my consoles are reserved for platformers, sports games, and racing games with FPS and RPGs being pushed to the PC. To me, the console is supposed to be fun first and foremost and if for any reason it fails to live up to that billing then, it fails as a console. With that said, let me get right into my review.ENGINEERING AND DESIGNThe console is slim, the graphics are fast enough, and the design is really sharp.It is a pretty nice piece of hardware and it delivers some pretty nice image quality but, in terms of computing power, most mid-range computers with discrete graphics are as strong or stronger but, that's now why you would buy a console.  You buy a console for simplicity and convenience and Sony manages to do fairly well with the design in these areas.CONTROLSYou know, I never had an issue with the past PlayStation controllers outside of the fact that they were too lite and felt more fragile than they actually were. The PS4 Dual Shock controllers feel really good and have a decent amount of weight to them in your hand.The touch pad on the controller is a little awkward in that it serves a function but, it was almost like they added it as a me too kind of feature when they saw the Wii U controller (it is better than people give it credit for). I guess we might see more use for it in the future but, I've only used it for Escape Plan (Indy Title) killzone Shadow Fall (Awkwardly too I might add).The options button, does just what it says, it brings up a menu of features or options for every aspect of the system. It just works and I find no fault with this other than it is a rebadged select button.The share button, I'm dumbfounded by this button, yeah it is cool but, really??? All I can do is share on Facebook or Twitter with it! It's baffling to say the least as I don't see either of those as being the place where people upload videos very often. Where is the YouTube or Daily Motion options Seriously, it is confusing at best unless you're going to live stream your game play (Let's not even talk about the added uselessness of the poor quality videos it records or the HDCP Copy Protection even when gaming).This voice control isn't very good on this console.  First, you won't even know it has the option if you don't plug the mic in to the controller or connect the camera.  Second, there are all of like 8 commands and those only accept a limited number of variables.  Third, I often had to say PlayStation twice even though the mic was literally right next to my mouth!The controller is decent overall but, the voice controls are average at best.The one caveat is that the Xbox One brought Kinect Interaction with voice commands in many 3rd party titles ad those developers actually left them in the Game for the PS4 versions of the games and these do work well.INTERFACE  This is one area where Sony has learned from the PS3.They broke the settings, messaging, and other features off to their own section of the main screen and that works great for me.  This is a big plus over the previous generation.The biggest downsides appear to be in their decision making process.They gave you the ability to upgrade the drive so, you can put a 3 TeraByte drive into the machine but, all of your apps install to the center line on the console and that could honestly become huge and unmanageable (Even if the most recently used are in the front).  What makes this even more bizarre is the fact that this very line has a folder called Library but, do they put everything in there?  Nope, just the digital stuff!  Why?  Seriously, move all the apps to this folder and let us choose what's on the main screen!Another flaw is in the Battery Meter implementation.  When you first sign in to the console, yhe meter is in the upper right hand side of the screen and disappears...  After that you tap the PS button and WTF??? nothing happens??? You then learn you have to hold the PS button in, go all the way to the log out screen and you find the meter again but, it isn't in the upper right as large as day!!! Nope, it is now a tiny icon in the lower right near your name.  Not sure what they were thinking here but, this is poor design.LAUNCH GAMESThis is a big area where I feel like Sony dropped the ball as most games are only slightly above average and none of them (even to this day) will blow you away or make you feel like you've gotten your money's worth from the system.Killzone: Shadow Fall  This is pretty much a straight up FPS where the opening cityscapes look very cool but, the game isn't free roaming at that point so you can look but don't touch...  As you get further into the game some of the visual quality degrades fast (The flowing river looks like it is from the Quake 1 days before the Monster 3D).  For the most part, I've found the game boring to say the least even if it does look stunning in parts.Knack  This is a pretty much a hack and slash 3/4 overhead platformer and honestly it has gotten mistreated by the media.  The game is actually a lot of fun but, not as visually pleasing as its other launch siblings.  This game represents the realization that good looking does not always mean most fun and to me, I'm relearning this with this generation of consoles.Resogun  This was a PSN freebie and while it is cool, it is pretty much a copy of the Classic title Defender on Steroids so, if you liked Defender, you'll likely love this game.  I had some fun playing it but, like Defender, I never really got into it.PLAYSTATION NETWORKThe PSN has only a fraction of the servers that Xbox Live has and this was something I hadn't realized when I purchased the PS4. While this hadn't been a big issue since launch, it became a much larger issue with the opening of all those Christmas consoles as the past week has had a lot of lag when trying to play games online and even making a connection is sometimes a challenge.The plus side to the network is that you can use Amazon Prime, Netflix, and other streaming apps without having a membership to PlayStation Plus where as Xbox requires a Live Gold membership to even use those apps.Another benefit is the fact that you get free games that are yours as long as you keep a membership with PS+.Also, game sharing is a feature of the PSN network but, you have to login to the other persons console to download the games to it is kind an awkward sharing feature that isn't very practical.A PS Plus membership does allow up to 5 accounts to play games online but, only the primary member has cloud sync capability and this creates an issue when a company like EA screws up and writes all saved campaign data to the cloud.  With the Xbox Live, you everybody gets access to your Live Gold service and all of its features so, everybody gets the cloud on Xbox One.INTERFACEThe Sony interface is pretty straight forward and familiar to most.There are two rows of icons where the first row is pretty much set and it will always be the same regardless of what is installed on the system. The second row is where your library and games are stored and honestly, this row is kind of annoying because you everything you install forms one giant horizontal row of apps and games and that to me is out of control!Overall it is pretty simple to use, in some ways it is easier than Xbox One but, not in others.For instance, they gave you the battery indicator but, it appears one place when launching the system and another entirely when using the system, that's really poor for continuity if you ask me.CUSTOMER SERVICEHere's where the wheels fall off the console! The previously mentioned issues with NBA 2K14 are a big enough issue that I approached Sony for a refund as I bought the game on a digital download... Not only did they refuse to help with the situation, they pretty much didn't even see the connection between me buying the game from them and their level of responsibility with that.I spent a good 30 to 40 minutes arguing with the Sony Support reps and pretty much left with the resolution that they're never going to help me and I'm not going to buy another digital download from them!Sony Support angered me so much, I actually did sell the console about 6 weeks later and while this wasn't the only reason I sold it, it was a big reason why.Of course, on a side note, 2K finally reached out to me and told me they would give me all my VC back if I delete my player and start over. That stinks but, it is either that or lose the money and the fact that it took them 3 weeks to even acknowledge my request with no help from Sony at all leaves me questioning Sony's commitment to their customers and I will never buy another digital item from Sony and I'll be passing on Take Two games in the future.MISSING FEATURESFirst, I had no idea the console didn't support 3D Bluray when I bought it and I also had no idea that DLNA and even playback of movies or music from USB Media wasn't allowed either!Let me just say that both this and the Xbox One are incomplete consoles. However, this is a pretty complete list of things this console cannot do.*No YouTube uploading*No YouTube App #1 Video sharing service and no support at all.*No Google+ Support (this affects YouTube or it wouldn't really matter)*No Streaming or Playing of MP3 or MP4 files (not even from your PC or USB drive)*No Support for external hard drives at all at this point (most of the list comes from Sony)*No Sony Support for apps purchased from their digital store (so buy the hard copies)*No Ability to rename your online account (MS does this but, it will cost $20)*No Promoting a Child Account to an adult account, they get to start over*No Suspending or Resuming Games or Apps*No Support for 3D BluraySome of you might be okay without these features but, some will no doubt not like this at all.CONCLUSIONI'm torn between love and hate for this console and its creator. I really do love the console but, I really hate Sony right now and unfortunately, you cannot have one without the other.Overall, the lack of DLNA support, 3D Bluray, Removable Media Support, Poor Sony Support, Poor game library,  and a console that is even less complete than the Xbox One are all factors as to why I decided to sell the unit.Maybe some day I'll revisit this console again but, Sony has a real problem on their hands in my opinion because they have a console that lacks all the best features of their previous generation (and many of those from their competition).  I know most people say, that Sony is really focused on gamin and they had better be because the Console doesn't do very much else!What you really get here is a console that is focused on games and yet doesn't have a single game that would make you run out and buy it at the moment.  Sony is presently selling these units based on a spec sheet but, when people start to realize it isn't very fun, those numbers might just drop off pretty fast!I would say, pass on this console until they get more games out because, what they have now isn't worth it!","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDHV5VLASY2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9WK2#wasThisHelpful","R2BDHV5VLASY2G","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having watched the launch of the Surface RT I was very impressed by what Microsoft had done as they had just served the rest of the industry notice that they weren’t going to let their market share slip away without a fight.  I genuinely wanted this tablet and would have bought it if it launched within a week of the press event.The first big blow against the tablet came of course, when they immediately blew their big debut by waiting 6 months to launch the Tablet and by then, better and faster devices were just around the corner.  The second blow came when Microsoft announced the Tablet would debut for $499 without a keyboard and $599 with the Touch Cover.  Now they were in iPad territory with an unproven product and had given the lower end to Android.  The third issue arose when the Tablet wasn’t 100% optimized at launch and reviewers noted the poor desktop mode for touch use and the poor performance of even the more low end apps and games.  All 3 of these lead to a 900 Million dollar write off by the RT Division by Microsoft and a Holiday purge of the original Surface RT.I’m outlining the story because, like many, I was never going to pay $500 for this tablet alone when it essentially was very close to the specs of my $199 Nexus 7 and had a lower screen resolution.  However, I purchased one from the holiday clearance event but, this time, it was half the launch price and included the touch cover.BUILD The Build of the Surface RT is very solid with the magnesium casing and the Gorilla Glass 2 display features one of the highest quality builds on the market.  The kickstand on the back is solid and cleverly hides the Micro SD Card slot.DISPLAY The display is measured around 400 nits which puts it ahead of many of the tablets from last year but behind the current crop of tablets but, don’t sweat this as it is very bright and you will have no issues reading it in most lighting.The resolution is 1366x768 at 10.6” and 147.4 PPI so, it is on par with many of the previous generations’ displays but, has fallen behind the current generation.Overall, the display is plenty bright, has good Contrast, good color, and competes very well all around with many of the current tablets on the market and it pretty much hands the iPad Mini a butt whooping and even outperforms the iPad mini retina in many areas.  This one aspect says, to me, that $250 to $300 is the right price range for the tablet with or without the cover.FEATURES This tablet has many of the features that people want standard in such a device.  It feature, Micro HDMI, a Full-sized USB, a Headphone Jack, Stereo Speakers, a Kickstand, Gorilla Glass 2, Magnesium Body, Optional Keyboard Covers, XBOX 360 Wired Controller Support, Bluetooth, Wireless N, Quad Core CPU, 2 Gigs of RAM, and a Magnetic Power Connector.  It literally is a virtual checklist of pretty much everything you would want in a tablet at a price you can afford.PERFORMANCE This is really tricky because I have to break the kit in two to make sure I’m fair all around.  So, let me start with the Touch Cover…  It’s horrible and has very poor response as well as flakey output.  At first, I was very disappointed with the Surface and then I noticed that interacting with the display itself was very quick whereas using the keyboard was very frustrating!  I would soundly say the keyboard should get a single star and that’s only because it provides protection for the display because it clearly wasn’t much good as a keyboard. The Tablets performance on the other hand has improved greatly since its launch and Windows RT 8.1 hasn’t negatively impacted the device in any way.  Touch is very responsive, apps launch quickly and almost never show any slowdown at all from their initial speeds.  Overall, it is a solid performing tablet and probably the best Tegra 3 tablet on the market.BATTERY I’ve been on this tablet for hours at a time and I’m positive you can get between 8 and 10 hours from this puppy.  It really is very good in this regard and I’ve used it for everything from Amazon Prime Instant Video, YouTube, and Web Surfing, to Email, and Word Processing.SOFTWARE The surface RT came with Windows RT 8 and out of the box it was sluggish to say the least.  Apps wouldn’t update and it just seemed to be lagging at random.  Microsoft Office RT was a prerelease version and didn’t even have Outlook installed.  Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed with this aspect of the tablet but, after getting all updates and upgrading to Windows RT 8.1 the performance of this software has been pretty much bug free and works as smoothly as I expected it to at launch.By pressing WIN KEY + X on the desktop you can launch the control panel and run Windows Update to get all the patches as this should be the first thing you do and then you should go to the Windows Store and tell it to upgrade to Windows RT 8.1 as this is the only way to get the full release version of Office 2013 RT.WHY SURFACE? The Surface RT has had a bit of a bad rap and most people have been asking why Microsoft did this.  Well, the Surface RT allowed Microsoft to release a tablet that could compete with the long battery life of the other tablets and would give them a position with the cool running, low powered chips that were going into billions of smartphones and tablets.The better question might be, who is this aimed at?  First, it isn’t going to be the big gaming tablet as it is underpowered for Console quality gaming but, having Office built in and compatibility with all the hardware that Windows supports means this might be the ultimate tablet for students and professionals that need a laptop that can do real work for long stretches at a time.APPS Apps might be a challenging area for most people but, it isn’t as bad as people believe.  Sure there aren’t as many native apps for the platform but, it has an advantage that makes that less of an issue.  Internet Explorer is the full desktop version and has Flash built in so, this means the Tablet can play Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Netflix, and YouTube videos without the need for an app (there are native apps for several of these).  It also means that I can read Nook, Kindle, and Google Play Books right from the browser (two of the three have native apps) so, there’s no limit to the most basic access you would need and even social networking works fine straight out of the browser.OPTIMIZATIONS These should be done after you’ve upgraded to Windows RT 8.1 as they will reset if you do them before the upgrade.This first optimization pretty much guarantees that your system won’t be loading down the graphics subsystem with useless fluff.On the Desktop, swipe, on the touchscreen, in from the right and select settings, and then choose PC Info.  When the System Window opens up click “Advanced System Settings” and on the “Advanced” Tab of the System Properties dialog box, click the “Settings” button (Under Performance) and set the “Visual Effects” to “Adjust For Best Performance” and then Check the Box Marked, “Smooth Edges Of Screen Fonts” and Click “Ok” and then “Ok” Again.This second optimization sets the keyboard and touch response to a short delay so you’re not likely to run into a wall while typing.Swipe in from the right and select the Search” option.In the search box type “Regedit” and click “Enter”.When prompted by the User Access Control to allow the application to run, click “Yes”.Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\TouchPrediction and set the following settings…LATENCY = 2SAMPLETIME = 2Then close Regedit and reboot the tablet.Honestly, these are minimal improvements as the tablet already performs very well so, don’t feel like you have to do these but, if you’re looking for any edge you can get then, they’re a quick boost.CONCLUSSION The Surface is everything I had hoped it would be when Microsoft announced it and now it is at a price that I am willing to pay (I actually paid it over the holiday weekend).  If you’re on the fence over this, don’t worry about it but, I have to caution against getting the kit with the Touch Keyboard unless it is included for less than the Tablet runs alone.  Seriously, well worth the $249 I paid for it and I’m very impressed with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4P5RZIQ3QGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XE0K7W#wasThisHelpful","RH4P5RZIQ3QGQ","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Fire HDX after seeing Apple raise the price of their iPad Mini by $70 if I wanted the Retina Display model.PERFORMANCEThe hardware is top notch in that it is a very solid build and seems to run almost flawlessly every day!The power of the CPU/GPU are honestly impressive and make for a very nice performance bump over previous generations of the Fire as well as other tablets. I honestly think the iPad Mini Retina and the Fire HDX are in a performance class all of their own!DISPLAYThe screen is super sharp and has incredible contrast all around, color accuracy is very high but, the backlight does have a soft blue glow around the edges.Now a note from my Eye Doctor, Increased intake of blue light into our eyes has raised the percentage of people who have degenerative disorders with their eyes and they recommend Yellow Filtered Lenses to protect your eyes.  Research Macular Degeneration and Blue Light to see for yourself and keep in mind, this is not exclusive to the Fire HDX but, their decision to use Blue Lighting makes it worth mentioning (this has always been an issue but, mobile devices and increased use of computers make it a much larger issue).SOFTWAREThe interface of the software only has one feature that bugs the check out of me and that's the Carousel, everything else with the OS and apps actually works very well and I'm pretty impressed with what I'm seeing! Oh and Silk works great if you stop it from accelerating page loading because, it crashes often with that on.Mayday is also a pleasant surprise and I've used it a few times for some quick answers. It was way easier than googling the answers and even my Apple friends were really impressed with it.Another issue was that Amazon noted that you could now download Prime Videos to watch on the go but, they neglected to mention that it is only a small selection of movies that can be downloaded so you're forced to stream them and that creates larger issues with Battery Life (see the Battery Section).Not having a YouTube App underscores a larger issue with the Fire line...  The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!  This is a real issue and you would think that Amazon would want to stress the importance of getting these apps to work right out of the box!The Interface also has support for posting to Facebook and Twitter but, no Google+ and I'm not sure why Amazon is so intent on being Anti Google with their devices.BATTERY LIFEBattery is decent for every day tasks like Facebook, web browsing, emailing, reading books, playing a few games, and watching an occasional video clip.However, streaming movies from Prime resulted in a Net Battery Life of 5 Hours and that's half what Amazon claimed!OVERALLNo YouTube and using a blue back light has left me rating the Fire as average and I honestly think Amazon might have made a mistake with this screens back lighting. Everything else about the tablet is spot on and well worth the money they charge for it.For the record, even though I consider it an average offering, it is the best deal for the money and sadly, the other offerings might actually be worse than the Fire (the Nexus 7 FHD certainly is far less stable as is the iOS 7 based iPad line).Okay, two more notes that happened to me today...1st, the Tablet randomly decided to reboot itself while I was reading an ebook and that's twice it has done this in the kindle App.2nd, While I was tethering the device just decided it was going to download a very large firmware update without telling me it was doing it and needless to say, before I realized it my monthly data allowance was done!  I guess the only consolation here is that it might have actually fixed the first issue!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 11/25/13The latest patch from Amazon appears to have remedied the lockup issue and I'm very pleased with it.Since the locks were happening however, I purchased an iPad Mini Retina and honestly, I find the fire HDX to be more responsive and fluid overall and the display is noticeably more vibrant on the Fire HDX.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1U8Q0LABNFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWYQ9YE#wasThisHelpful","R1T1U8Q0LABNFU","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the game and the graphics look great on the Fire HDX but, the controls are the worst I've seen on any tablet or phone.  Literally, the right arrow barely works and the left arrow is too close to the edge to be comfortable to use.I was really hoping the game would be more playable as it works 10 times better on the Nexus 7 2013 and while the controls are better on the iPad that isn't up to the Nexus either...  However, the Fire HDX has the worst controls of the bunch, literally almost unplayable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFIJTLR2ARAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096MM9GG#wasThisHelpful","RFIJTLR2ARAN","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The future of RAM is going to be Quad Channel and this RAM has that covered.  It can function in Dual Channel as well so it works with current medium and high-end main boards.  As of right now the only Desktop Mother Boards that support this RAM run the Intel X79 Chipset.I'm currently using this in a Gigabyte Z77 based Mother Board.  The Z77 only supports RAM upto 1600 MHz but, the Turbo-Mode of the board allowed the Memory to top out at 1866 and honestly it runs very stable at these speeds.Good all around RAM and my only disappointment is that it wasn't available in 8 Gig Modules at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RWG6TWLV5180/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JLDDSO#wasThisHelpful","R3RWG6TWLV5180","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I bought this card from Newegg because the shipping times from Amazon were 2 to 4 Weeks Out!  Newegg got it to me in time for the BF4 launch.PACKAGINGThis box was a big square block and really was unlike any Graphics Card packaging I personally had seen before so, it immediately sets itself apart.  Inside the box are two cables, several documents, a driver's CD, and the Card itself.INSTALLATIONThe card went in fairly easily with my PSU having all the required connectors but, it is a very large card and it actually is slightly loner than an ATX mainboard is wide.  The only confusing part is that the Dongles included are obviously there for adapting your power supply connectors but, one of the notes told you not to use them...  I was a little baffled by this but, I didn't need them anyway so, it was all good.Oh and the biggest issue I had with installation was the fact that I don't have an optical drive and I couldn't even find reference to the website on the enclosed materials.  It's okay though as it turns out they used the stock AMD Drivers so, you can get those on the website.BUILDThe card itself seems very sturdy and it features Dual Fans (Double D is Dual Dissipation) as well as Copper Heat Pipes to effectively manage the heat better.  The design appears to be really well done and I'm not sure you're going to find a much better build than this.One note however, I do give the Asus a slight edge as it has a back plate to prevent it from suffering any sagging of the circuit board as that has been shown to be an issue on the Gigabyte R9-280x boards and the verdict is still out on the XFX but, so far so good.PERFORMANCEI've only tested two games so far but, BF3 and Tomb Raider both maintained frame rates between 80 and 90 on their highest settings while running at 1080P and if the new Mantle API covers BF4 with the same grace, the Card has done everything I've asked of it.  Just played BF4 for several days now and this beast will run the game, on Ultra, around 55 FPS and these aren't even finished drivers!  I'm not seeing a huge difference between this and the GTX 770 though so, I'm not sure what good Mantle is at this moment.Ripped an hour and forty minute bluray at 7000 bitrate in 45 minutes using AMD acceleration and PavTube to create the MP4.  My Nvidia cards were always over an hour for this quality so, I'm very happy with this!*** Another note, I never had any heat issues with this card so, I'm not sure why others are but, I don't Over Clock the card so, that might be an issue for some.OVERALLThe card is very good and if not for the few niggles, which really are mostly unrelated to the actual card,  it is well worth the $309 I paid for it.  What you're getting from this card is GTX 770 Performance for a GTX 760 price and that's really bad news for Nvidia!*** One more note, this card is said to be supported by OS X without any driver injection or kext loading. ***","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KEE7T2M0SPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSC5N66#wasThisHelpful","R18KEE7T2M0SPX","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fight Club is the chaos created by one man with a dissociative personality disorder and it seriously shows the potential for Mental Illness to pervert the world as we know it.The acting was great, I never cared for Ed Norton before this movie but, I really like him as an actor now.  Brad Pitt was cool, reserved and in control or, as in control as the man who wasn't there could be.  Helena Bonham Carter was Marla in a reserved sense but, she still managed to pull it off well.  Meat Loaf Aday as Robert Paulson had a small role in the film but, it was well played and well used to support the story.The screen play was decent but, it lacked some details that helped you understand some things in the movie.For instance, the Mechanic had a larger role in the book than in this story and he helped to explain mind of Tyler Durden as well as being the man who would attempt cut off Ed Norton's Nuts (which wasn't in a police station by the way).  Also, Marla has a series of boyfriends with serious issues and she not only thought the whole split personality was cool but, actually helped Ed Norton stay awake so Tyler couldn't take over his body.  Another point is the fact that the main character realized he had multiple personalities a little more than halfway through the book as the two met in passing, and then he spent most of the rest of the book trying to undo the damage that Tyler had done.  And finally, they left out the fact that Tyler instructed them all to cut people's nuts off if they made any attempt to shutdown Fight Club in any way, and this lead to threats against police chiefs and a fridge full of frozen testicles from people attempting to stop the movement.Overall, they did do a really good job with the movie but, I still recommend you read the book as it builds upon the story and you will actually get a pretty good sense of how the story would really unfold.So, with that said, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you've been living under a rock for the past 13 years and really need to climb out from under there!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBGPYNBBBZ8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001H1SVO8#wasThisHelpful","R1KBGPYNBBBZ8D","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Act 1 Scene 1 begins with silence and within seconds the sound trumpets loudly with the force of Beethoven's 5th symphony. We see a French Warship leaning to one side and at least half a dozen ropes running from it when the scene cuts to prisoners righting the ship and pulling it into dry dock.The singing begins and surprisingly, Hugh Jackman (As Jean ValJean) does a decent job with his vocals and can actually carry a tune, ""Look Down, Look Down"" and a cut to Javert standing on the side of the docking bay starring down at the convicts pulling the boat into the bay.Within Minutes, Javert is up and man, I have to say I am starting to question the casting of Russell Crowe in this part. I cannot tell you what Javert was singing because Crowe's voice was horrible at best and easily the worst in the movie, so bad in fact that I wanted to mute the movie (but, I resisted).The scene finishes with ValJean getting parole for the rest of his life. He served 20 years, 5 of which was for stealing a Loaf of Bread, 15 were for running from the law.Scene 2 is ValJean realizing his past is following him but, he gets taken in by the church, given food, and a bed. He repays them by stealing most of their Silver and is rounded up by the police and returned to the Church where, the priest corroborates ValJean's claim that the Silver was given to him. Later in the scene the priest tells him that his soul was purchased for God by that silver and he is now a changed man. ValJean struggles with the idea that somebody holds that much value in him and uses the Silver goods to start a new life.Without going much further into the story, a whole series of connected events lead up to ValJean taking on a new identity, violating parole, being exposed and adopting a child with whom he takes on the run with him. The whole time is set on a burgeoning Revolution and his whole life is spent running from Javert (maybe if he stopped singing ValJean would have stopped running) and raising his adopted Daughter.The highlight of the movie comes with Fantine's solo (Anne Hathaway) and is really one of the most powerful performances I've ever seen. I honestly believe that Anne Hathaway was feeling very deeply when doing that take as there was a point when she seemed truly distressed and she is easily what put the movie over the top.The lowlight was clearly with the casting and there's no way, I would have even considered casting Sacha Baron Cohen in any role of this nature and yet they did! There was one scene where the Inn keeper was peeing into the wine bottles of his patrons, no joke and it really seemed awkward. Also, as soon as Crowe started singing I would have found a replacement in a hurry!The biggest surprise in the movie, Samantha Banks as Eponine. She has a fantastic voice and really shouldn't have been playing second fiddle to Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) as far as continuity goes.Did I like the movie? Yeah, it was a very good and solid movie but, the lack of french accents in France, some poor casting choices, and set design that seemed to peak early on left you with an incredible begining and an average ending.Is it worth watching? Yes it is but, I preordered the movie and now I know why it was only $14 as it was good but, failed to live up to the hype so, rent it first and if you like it that much, then buy it.It is really a 3.5 star movie but, I'm giving it the benefit of a 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZPNT7UYB888/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005S9EKCW#wasThisHelpful","R2PZPNT7UYB888","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying this review will have spoiler information regarding both versions of this movie.PLOTCommunists invade the USA and start an occupation while freedom fighters use guerrilla warfare to expel the enemies from their land.  The Plot for both movies is pretty much identical.SETTING1984 Version is set in the mid western town of Calumet Colorado.2012 Version is set in Seattle and Spokane Washington but is said to encompass Oregon and Washington States as occupied by the North Koreans.ENEMIES1984 featured Cuban and Nicaraguan aggressors attacking the USA after a communist Coup in Mexico...  Russians later joined in by attacking Alaska and pushing down through Canada.2012 features North Korea attacking two states while other agressors like Cuba and Russia attack California and the East Coast...  Again, the Russians join the assault later and provide Intel to the North Koreans.REVIEWOkay, as you probably already know this film is more like a Reboot than a Remake.First, we are supposed to suspend belief in the 1984 version and assume that a group of kids with no real military training were able to fight off the Cubans and Soviets...  In the 2012 version, the lead character was an Iraq war veteran who provided the training for the kids so that is a major improvement over the original movie.Second, we're being told that the North Koreans are a less formidable enemy than the Nicaraguans and Cubans when this simply is not true; North Korea has the worlds 4th Largest Army and they have Nukes!  Both movies had the main aggressor receiving Russian backing so neither has an advantage there.  Bottom line, North Koreans in Spokane is a hell of a lot more believable than Cubans in Colorado.Third, the first movie alludes to an eventual purge of the occupiers by Americans but, we're left with no details about how or who finished the fight.  In the new movie, they're joined by 3 Marines looking for a communications device that will be used to crack the encrypted communication of our enemies and we're given a lot more information about what is happening in other parts of the country.  We also see more and more people joining the Wolverines as the resistance grows and we have a pretty good idea who expels the enemies and how they do it.Fourth, Where are all the actors from the original movie now?  Of the two most notable, one is dead and the other killed the number 1 comedy on TV only to create a second rate version of the show later on.  Most of the other, we likely will never hear from again.  The new cast has a few that have already been in big movies and are likely to have decent careers...  It also features new actors who could have a very bright future of their own.  The bottom line is that neither movie has any oscar winners as of this time but, the odds favor the new group of at least having one.MISCONCEPTIONSThere's an assumption that the kids planned to get their food from Subway, and this simply is not true...  They ducked into the subway sandwich shop and didn't even realize they where they were but, upon realizing it they robbed the place for food.Another assumption is that their feature phone wouldn't work even though the power is out...  Again, this isn't true as the Grid is the only thing that is down, if it were an actual EMP device many of the cars would have had issues with their electrical systems as well.  What actually happened was likely a Cyber Attack on the grid as all the news articles leading up to the power outage discuss that as the #1 threat to America.CONCLUSIONThe old movie was nostalgic and a cult classic but, lets not try to paint it as the best film ever, it simply was not!  The new film is actually an upgrade in many areas and perhaps the North Koreans couldn't develop some type of Non-Nuclear EMP device or even get close to our shore line but, they are infinitely more capable of wreaking havoc than the Cubans were in 1984 (Sorry but, the Cubans couldn't blink without us knowing which eye blinked first).  This movie stands as a decent movie all around and neither the acting nor the story is as bad as many are making this out to believe.Here's a little piece of trivia for you...John Milius (who directed and co-wrote the 1984 Screenplay for Red Dawn) created a videogame called Homefront in which those invading America were the North Koreans.  Funny that he would see it as plausible but, some second rate reviewers and nostalgia buffs dismiss the idea huh?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGY94F9FPZ9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BESC3XY#wasThisHelpful","R2UGY94F9FPZ9G","A1S2M6SA4OAUNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2M6SA4OAUNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have couple of items from BeFit24 and I like all of them. They are quality items and it works well for me.  I got this Lumbar Support Belt for my husband. He's been complaining lately about his back and I thought this will provide support that he needs.  Below is my review based on what my husband said.Pros:• It is made with very good quality. Heavy Duty.  It’s not easily stretchable, so it provide good lumbar support.• This support is better than Medical Grade band. This BeFit24 belt is as good as the one that he purchased from the doctor’s office with much cheaper price.• It does keep spine straight, so it corrects posture, while it supports Lumbar. While he wears this Lumbar Support Belt, he doesn’t noticed if he even has back pain. But, when he took it off and forgot to wear it, his back pain comes back. So, it really does ease the pain. He can tell the difference.• Comfort – It’s hard to get used to ‘not so easy to stretchable’ back support belt at the beginning. but if you can past just couple of days wearing it,  you can get used to it and it is very comfortable.Cons:• Size – I ordered size Large,  he is between sizes. He wears Med – large (more to large than med).  This is what he normally wears.  Because  this belt doesn’t stratch much, this fits just enough.  If it was just few inches shorter, it wouldn’t work.  So, it could be better to order 1 size bigger.Disclaimer: I received discount coupon code for this item to check out and write my personal opinion.

"I always enjoy warms on my body even during the summer time.  This warmer works well and I like it as 'warmer'.  However, there are some issues.Pros:• It charges up very fast and stay warm for long time.• Charger is automatically turn off once it is fully charged. Nice feature.• Good workmanship. Stitching is good. No lose threads.• Fabric used in this warmer is soft and feels really good.• Pouch to keep hand in is good idea.Cons:• Filling water to this warmer is near impossible. It took me long time to fill it.  Funnel is very small (just about the size of my Thumb) and I can pour water literally using syringe to fill.  There is no other way to fill this faster. If there is, I don’t know how.• I still don’t know how to drain the water.  Or once it is filled, never to drain?  I don’t know. I would assume water should be changed time to time, but I don’t see any other plug to pour the water out of it.• Manual.  It’s doesn’t explain well.  I have to figure it out myself, which isn’t so hard.  But, it should have explain better/more in details.Conclusion:  I love this warmer if I can only rate this item on warming effect. However, it need re-design some of feature. i.e. filling water faster and easier.  Also, drain water from the warmer.  Is this design as 'never to drain' ?  Water does go bad and create all kind of health threats. So, I am concern about this.Disclaimer: I received discount coupon code for this item to check out and write my personal opinion.

"I was excited to receive wallet style for my phone case/protector.  While I like to have my cell phone with credit cards and money all in one place, this wallet has some design flaws.  The below is my review on this item that I list pros and cons.Pros:• Good looking wallet. Even though it is made with PU leather, it feels and looks like leather.• Good workmanship. Stitching is good. No lose threads.• It came with phone screen protector and also stylus & pen combo• Wrist strap is removable, so it can be used as wallet or purse.Cons:• I can’t close the wallet if I have credit cards and ID. Even for just couple of cards, Wallet won’t stay closed. The width of the wallet isn’t thick enough to hold credit cards and the phone.It has many slots for CC, but there is no way it will stay close.• Magnet to hold the phone is strong, but I have a problem using my phone. When I try to use google map or even access to my phone stored address, I can’t access. It looks like my phone is malfunction. This problem is intermittent, but nonetheless, it is an issue for me to use this wallet style phone cover.Conclusion:  Even if I don't keep credit card in the wallet, phone doesn't function time to time because of magnets used in this wallet, this wallet style phone cover is completely useless for me.Disclaimer: I received discount coupon code for this item to check out and write my personal opinion.

"I love soy milk and almond milk.  Before I have this bag, I used fine mesh strainer to get the milk, but it is not easy to use the strainer to get the milk.  This Nut Milk bag makes very easy to make my favorite soy milk and almond milk.  It really does a good job of separating milk and pulp.  After use, cleaning is also easy. I turn the bag inside out and just wash it in the dish washing soap and rinse.  Let it air dry and it's ready to use again.I found this bag to be very useful in my kitchen.  I am also making cabbage juice every single day (it's for Stomach Ulcer and one of my family member has it). If anyone make Cabbage juice will know it is almost impossible to get the juice out of it and adding water using juicer is not going to work.  If you are using blender like Vitamix, which I am using it to make this Cabbage drink, you still have to add good amount of water and it still so thick and so much, it is hard to get it down.So, I am using this bag to get the liquid after grind cabbage with Vitamix. Pour it into this bag, squeeze it and you can get the liquid without the fiber.  It's so easy to drink cabbage juice now.  I use it to make carrot juice too. My 3 years old niece loves carrot juice. Since I don't have a juicer,  used my Vitamix to grind carrots and pour it into this bag and squeeze the juice out of it.  It's easy to use, easy to clean, re-usable.

"I love this Amplixin Hydrating hair Masque.  It’s like hair conditioner, but much more effective in my case. Just short time I was introduced Amplixin’s product and I love all of their hair products.  Especially this Hydrating Hair Masque is one of my favorite.After I shampoo, instead of regular conditioner, I use this on my hair and leave it.  I do this first before I wash my face and body, etc.  And wash off the masque last. This way, I have it on my hair long enough to condition.  I alternate Conditioner to Masque.  I used 3 times so far and my hair feels wonderfully soft and look  healthy.  Dull looking hair to Shine in just couple of application. The end of hair looks healthy also.I have used similar type hair product in the past, but most of them feel heavy and oily. But, this Amplixin hydrating Hair Masque conditions without oily or adding heaviness to my hair.Disclaimer:  I received a coupon code for Amplixin  Hydrating Hair Masque to test, in exchange I write my opinion about the item.

"Disclaimer:  I received discount coupon code from Anypro to test Anypro Aromatherapy Ultrasonic Diffuser to  write my personal opinion.  The Company/Seller did not influence in anyway how I rate this product. What I wrote in my review, whether good or bad, is voluntary and entirely my own.I consider myself an avid essential oil user. I use essential oil for many applications, I especially enjoy using Aromatherapy Ultrasonic Diffuser with a few drops of my favorite essential oil.  Since I am reviewing ‘Diffuser’, I will write what I like about this Anypro 200SL.I bought Aromatherapy Diffuser at least a dozen of them in the past.  Because of it, I know what to look for when it comes to Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Diffuser.  It comes in various sizes and prices; some are good and some aren’t even worth a penny.  I have several diffusers at home in different rooms and I use it all the time.  So, I hope my review can help someone looking to buy Essential Oil Diffuser for Aromatherapy.• Diffuser Time Control:This feature makes Anypro’s Aromatheraphy Diffuser exceptional.  It has one button to control how long I want it to diffuse the mist.  It has the settings to select diffusing operation time to 1 hour, 2 hours or 3 hours.  Most other diffuser on the markets usually diffuses continuously until there is no more water left in the tank.  Some of  one that has control, it doesn’t usually given a choice to select how long I want it to diffuse, rather, diffusers work like xx seconds on and xx seconds off continuously until tank is empty and this kind of diffuser is more expensive than the one that doesn’t control.• Price:This Anypro Aromatheraphy Diffuser is just under $30.00.  It has everything you want in Ultrasonic Aromatheraphy Diffuser.  So, in my opinion, this is very reasonably priced.  I bought small diffuser not too long ago and paid $49.00. I bought it because of the shape/design of the diffuser and it matches the guest bedroom’s décor.  It was clearly not a smart reason to buy a diffuser.• Installation/Assembly:Anypro’s Diffuser does not require assembly.  - Out of the box and ready to go!  Some of diffuser I bought before require assembly that came with poorly written manuals. I remembered one particular diffuser, there was very small coil spring part that I must place in order to diffuse, which it didn’t mentioned in the manual. I only able to figure it out only after several hours working to put the unit together.So, I was happy to see Anypro’s diffuser came without multiple pieces that I have to figure it out before I can start using it.• Setup:Just add a water into a reservoir with a few drops of my favorite essential oil and it’s ready to diffuse.• Water Level ControlThis is very nice feature.  When water level in reservoir, it shut off automatically. Many diffusers in the market will not diffuse without the water, yet, unit is still on. Which cuts service life of the diffuser.• Holding water capacity is 200ML200ML is a lots of water for diffuser.  It will last pretty much all night (if you are like me, I always turn my diffuser on at night before I go to bed).  I’ve used diffuser that doesn’t hold much water and it only last couple of hours.Even during the day, I use diffuser and constantly adding water isn’t always convenient, so 200ML holding capacity tank is very nice to have.• Inside water tank has smooth surface. Sometimes essential oil left inside of water tank that require through cleaning.  This diffuser's Inside water holding tank is very smooth and nothing in the way, so cleaning will be effortless.• Humidifying effectLight misting from this diffuser humidifies the room.  This I don’t like using regular humidifier. But Ultrasonic Diffuser add just right humidity to the room.• Very quiet machine.This diffuser is very quiet. I had diffuser made hissing sound and it can be annoying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3QG4I6UUMT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015H0ZLR4#wasThisHelpful","R3T3QG4I6UUMT8","A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I put my laptop on this cooling fan, my laptops off the desk top and cooling fan cools the laptop down.

I have extra tablets that I use as Media Server and most of movies and TV shows store in that machine. So, it is on pretty much all the time,  streaming movies/shows to TV.  After many hours of watching shows streaming through Media this  machine to gets really hot.  So, to test this Cooling Pad, I put media server to this fan and it is much better.  I would say it is warm, whereas before I put it on this cooling pad, it was ‘hot’ .

"Disclaimer:  I received discount coupon code from Anypro to test Anypro 600A Peak Current Portable smart Car Jumper and write my personal opinion.  The Company/Seller did not influence in anyway how I rate this product. What I wrote in my review, whether good or bad, is voluntary and entirely my own.Item that I am reviewing:  Anypro 600A Peak Current Portable smart Car JumperPros:  Many to list...(see below)• Light weight, compact portable smart car jumper.  Its height and width is about the size of iPhone 6Plus. Everything you need to jump start the car (all accessories/parts) came in nice looking carrying bag.• Powerful.  It’s 15000mAh.I have older model Volvo wagon sitting in my drive way for several months now. I need to bring the car in for maintenance and other minor issues, but I was too lazy to take time to bring the car in.  Now, the weather is starting to get cold. I know I can’t afford to procrastinate anymore and I should take car in to service.  Since car’s been sitting in the drive way for long time, and being its older car, as expected, car battery was completely drained.  So to test Anypro 600A Peak Current Portable smart Car Jumper for review,  I decide to use it to jump start the car.  My car is 8 Cylinder older model and usually when battery is completely drained, (it happened before) it takes little time and effort to start the car.After I ordered this item, I received an email Gary from Anypro explaining how to use the jump starter in case battery is completely dead, like my situation.  So, I follow the direction and my car started right away on first try. This normally doesn’t happen with this car. So, I was very happy this Anypro 600A Peak Current Portable smart Car Jumper get my car start up right away.• Short Clamps doesn’t get in the way when trying to jump start the car. It’s very convenient to put starter on next to car battery (on just about any flat surface) and don’t have to deal with long or sometimes not long enough (depends on where I am jump battery from) cables.• It has USB charging ports.  As show in my photo, Jump Starter came with 3 bars of charges.  So, I was able to charge iPod (which is also completely drained). Its smart enough to know what power I needed for the devices. It also charges faster than I expected.• It has built-in flashing light that can also signal SOS in case emergency.•  USB cord included in this package is for general Micro USB. So, if anyone has apple product, I suggest keep USB card that works for Apple product with this package. It’s well worth it.  Just the other day, I needed to charge my iPhone in my car, but I have USB port ready, but I didn’t have the cord.So, it’s best to keep USB cord for iPhone/iPad in the carrying case, so it’s all there.This is truly remarkable jump starter. All useful items packed in and it’s must have item and one should always keep this in the car. It could be a life saver, especially the weather we have in Chicago area during the winter months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13FH6T689BGHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154NK95S#wasThisHelpful","R13FH6T689BGHX","A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received discount coupon to purchase this item in exchange for my unbiased review.I don't have Mice or Roaches (Thank God for it), but I have ants coming in to the house and spiders. Sometimes, I see silverfish bugs too.  Since I have 2 dogs, who likes to chew on things or put anything they finds on the floor, I never use chemical to kill bugs. I’ ve used Diatomaceous –Earth in the past and while it really does good job controlling pest, it’s messy to clean up and shouldn’t breath in even though it was food grade Diatomaceous –Earth.So, I have switch to ultrasonic pest control devices recent years.  I have a few already and some just didn’t do the job and some makes annoying ticking or high-pitching noise, so I couldn’t use it.This BugzOff Pet control is pretty quiet, compare to what I’ve used before.  I put it in near the dog dishes where I found ants  (if any will come into the house, this is where I will see the ants) and I haven’t seen any ants.  I haven’t seen spiders either.  I don’t know if spiders just hiding or it actually kill spiders.  I always see one or two spiders around the house, but I haven’t found any since using this BugzOff.One thing that I found disturbing to note here.  The Review on this item by “Sykeena Mitchell”, mentioned this in his review.  “…  I believe it has also been helping keep my neighbors annoying dog off our yard, since their puppy has yet to come back around since I plugged this up as well, and he was a frequent unwanted visitor that I often found on my doorstep. Now I killed two birds with one stone. I did not want to have to address my new neighbors about this dog.”  I have 2 dogs and I do not want to hurt them in anyway. This item’s description said it does not hurts the pets.  I have no way of knowing if it does or doesn’t hurt the house pets.

"I received discount coupon to purchase this item in exchange for my unbiased review.When it comes to double sided tape, I have not yet found strong glue sticky enough to hold the item if item weights little heavy.  So, when I test this tape, I was very happy to see this is strong enough to  hold many items that I need for double sided tape to hold up on the wall.I have wind protecting foam tapes around my front door. The foam came already with self adhesive glue.  However, every time season changes, I ended up replacing it because of cold and hot weather between the season changes, it never hold more than few months without falling down.  Sometimes, it start to come down during installation.When I receive this tape, I immediately use it to place foam weather strip around the door. It's starting to get cold now already, so this is perfect timing to take care of weather strip. Weather strip was little bit smaller than this tape, but where it needs to install, little wider double sided tape actually worked better and perfect fit!  After I install, I tried to pull it down and see if it will come off easily, but I couldn't pull it down without tearing the foam.  So, I know this is sticky and it will stay on.  I love this tape and price is excellent.  I couldn't get double sided, strong tape at the store without paying 2x more for shorter length.This is SUPER STICKY double-sided tape and I want to mentioned couple of helpful Note on how I used this tape successfully.  Taking time to do this is the key:*  When cutting the foam,  new, sharp razor-blade type works the best. - DO NOT USE SCISSORS!  If you use scissors, sticky foam will stick to the scissors and  you'll have big mess on your hand.* Attaching/installation item A to item B -  It's best to cut the foam to the length of Item A first.  Then, match up the Item A to foam that you just cut.  Now, start peeling  off the waxy paper on the backside of this foam tape as you attach it to Item A.  You need to do this little length at a time and make sure to  line up Item A and the tape to stay straight  No matter what types of method you use to apply this double sided tape, DO NOT peel waxy paper on the foam all the way at once.  This tape is light weight and it doesn't hang down easily, thus, if you peel waxy paper from the foam, you'll have hard time keeping it straight.* Once you have Item A and this double sided foam tape together, do the same method mentioned above...  (little length at a time)  and apply Item A (now double sided foam tape is on) to the Item B.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLJRCBB2KFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3C8CBW#wasThisHelpful","RGLJRCBB2KFP","A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review.First, I never used any kind of 'Scar Cream'  until I now.  When I was young, I had severe acne problem and left couple of big scar on my chic. These scar is just too deep, even if I apply heavy makeup on scar area, there is no way to hide it.  So, I didn't think any topical cream, especially over the counter beauty product would work.  When I receive this bottle, I applied 2x daily about a week. I didn't see any results. Even though, I didn't expect the old scar to go away, but hoping it will at least reduced appearance of scar.  I was somewhat disappointed at this point. However,  so many positive reviews on this product, I decide to keep using it.About 2 weeks using this cream, I can see scar on my face look smoother. So, it is surely working.  It took about 2 weeks for me to see the changes. It really does work and I am going to keep up with this cream.

"I received this light in exchange for my review last week.Even though I didn’t have any of my lights needs to be replaced, I switched my break light bulbs with this bulbs and saved (keep it in my car) the bulbs that I took out as my spare bulbs.  I wanted to make sure driver behind me will see my break lights.  I had an accident a few years ago and person hit my car by following too close.  But he said to the police that my break light was too dull that he didn’t see it.  But police gave him a ticket as following too close and his insurance paid for the repairs.  Whether my break light is dull or not, the accident was his fault. But,  I don’t want to get in the accident like that againLLCJ’s break light bulbs is very bright.  It seems even brighter than my hi-beam light.  I am sure when I hit the break, driver behind me will notice for sure.  I know now my break light will be very bright and no one can say it is too dull.I like LLCJ’s bulbs.• It is LED bulbs, which last longer than normal light bulbs.• It’s brighter than the one originally installed.• Light bulb was very easy to install.

"If I called this is the softest washcloths in the world wouldn’t be an exaggeration.  Name said it’s “The Motherhood Collection” but it’s not just for babies.I use washcloth to wash my face day and night. Rather than just wash my face with bare hand, using washcloth (got to be soft) will exfoliate top layer of dead skin.  Exfoliated skin is moist and feel softer. Also, make up goes on better on exfoliated skin.Long time ago, I bought a robe that was made from 100 % Bamboo and it was the softest, lightest and the warmest robe I ever wore in my life. And it was very expensive too.  I wore it so many years to the point, it looks pretty ugly to wear it as robe.  So, I cut the area where it still has life left (like shoulder and collar area) and made a washcloths.  I am not kidding! I used every square inches of that robe.When I asked by the motherhood collection to try the washcloths in exchange for review, I knew that this would be  5 star review.*  It’s Eco Friendly – Bamboo is grass, not tree.  We should see more manufacturer take an advantage of bamboo and come up with products that are Eco Friendly as many area as possible, like this washcloth.* It’s feel so good on my skin – The softest fabric ever!  I don’t know how it is made from Bamboo, but I am so curious to know how it is made. I love it.* It absorbs water better and faster than 100% cotton towel and squeeze water out of the towel much easier than regular washcloths.And there's absolutely nothing  I dislike about this item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28M2XY5UROEWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J9BYC8#wasThisHelpful","R28M2XY5UROEWZ","A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I receive this item in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.I have reviewed about 5 Apple Watch Stand & iPhone stands past 6 months period and this is, by far, my favorite one.  Below, I will list things I like in comparison.*  It is truely 2 in 1 charge stand for Apple Watch and iPhone -  Some I reviewed in the past, the space is so tight, both can’t be used at the same time. Apple watch can be charging and iphone can also be charging or just rest (serve as holder) at the same time.*  Dealing with cords after connect to the devices. – the bottom of the stand is arched and I can wrapped my cord to shorten it. It has a slot to pull  wire thru at the back end of the bottom for cord management. (as shown in advertisement photo)*  Designed with perfect angle-- phone stays without sliding down and the angle of the stand,  iPhone stays for comfortable viewing while it is still on the stand.*  This Apple Watch and iPhone stand combo is so compact, it takes very little space on desk/table, yet it provide everything it needs to serve as ‘charging stand’.*  iPhone stand has silicone like material  (TPU) at the bottom to protect phone from scratches.  I have 3 pcs interlocking cover for my phone and the protective cover adds some thickness to my phone.  But even with thick cover, my phone fits nicely into this iVAPO’s stand. I can take in and out of the stand no problem.  Also for testing, I take the phone cover off (bare phone only) and put it on this stand. Because of the protection material at the bottom, my clothes-less phone stayed in the slot where I put it.*  Price is cheap. This is the best of the stand and the lowest price for stand that came across past 6 months.* Aluminium construction looks like stainless steel.  Its light weight, but stable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSRHWJX3WI9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151A9DEC#wasThisHelpful","R1GSRHWJX3WI9R","A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A042274212BJJVOBS4Q85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This iPhone 6Plus Arm Band was sent to me at no cost in exchange for my unbiased review.I owned many Cell phone cases, some I received for review purpose and some I bought for myself, but this type (Arm Band)  phone case is first for me.Here are the things I noticed about this  iPhone 6Plus Armband case.* It fits my iPhone 6Plus. But I have to take my regular phone case out first and use this Armband. It fits tightly. The Armband is stretchable to the limit.  So, phone doesn't fit if I have any case on even if it is thin case.* It's made with soft on the back (where it touches arm) with Neoprene and PU leather outside. It feels soft and stretchable. However, outside PU leather is shiny and looks like PU leather.  I've seen PU leather looks like real leather that I can't hardly tell the difference. But, this PU leather, it looks PU leather, cheap look, but it cost only $8.99* Stitching looks good. Overall workmanship is good.*  The straps goes around the arm is long enough, so that it can be used by most people.*  Key holder- I personally don't use this feature, but just for review, I use key to test. It stayed on at the beginning, but after working around the house and moving around here and there, I lost the key. I don't know when it came out of the slot.Practically of wearing Armband case.  -  Normally people wouldn't wear Armband phone case except for those special circumstances; like jogging, working around the house, etc.  Personally,  when I work around the house, or outside jogging,  ,I would prefer blue-tooth wireless earbuds.

"I've used face cleansing systems before but they were never waterproof.  So when I found this one by ESS, I decided to do a little digging to see if there are others that are better.  After much research, I chose ESS.What puts ESS above the other waterproof systems I researched is the ability to easily replace the brushes at a reasonable price.  That's the biggest expense of cleansing systems.  It's not so much the system in itself, it's the brushes.  Good brushes that's easily replaceable is the key.  The ESS brushes are fantastic.  My favorite is the body brush, it sounds kind of extreme to have such a large brush but it's fantastic!  I use it primarily on my knees, elbows, and foot.  The roughest spots on my body have never felt so soft.  Also I was doubtful it was strong enough to clear away spots on my skin that are prone to ingrown hair ... but it does!The pumice stone head is also great.  Now the other two are tougher to tell apart since they look identical at first.  But I've been using the softer one with more bristles as my face cleanser brush in the shower.  It's gentle enough for face and neck and it really helps the expensive face washes I use to get deeper into the pores.The other one that has less bristles is the exfoliation brush.  I have yet to use it.  But I'm sure it's just a matter of time before I get to it.The ESS system also spins, not like some others that just vibrates.  This system is a spinning system, waterproof, with easily replaceable brushes.  The handle and weight of the brush system is also just right.  Not too heavy, not to light, with an easy grip to hold without it slipping away in the shower.The original system is very affordable and the customer service is always there to support you.  What's not to love?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AX3IM89XH5I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYK2UI6#wasThisHelpful","R1AX3IM89XH5I5","A2MLUAAQFEB6WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MLUAAQFEB6WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried Liporidex PM and Plus.  I still prefer Liporidex PM as it does not contain any caffeine.  It takes about a month for the formula to work.  I had to take it consistently for one month before I saw any results.  But once it kicks in, I do start losing the weight.  Am I going to drop 10 pounds over night?  I wish.  I have a lot of pounds to lose after the second kid.One thing I learned about weight loss is the plateau.  There's a certain plateau I reach when I start working out.  I'm sure if I increased the workout regime, I would lose more.  But time is a constraint.  This is where Liporidex PM helsp me.  I started only taking it at night, which helped me shed a few more pounds.  Then I started taking in the day time.  That really helped some more.Does this mean I can go on a buffet binge?  No.  I still have to watch what I eat.  But at least this helped me get past my plateau.  Not feeling like a hungry all the time helps too.  I'm able to shed more pounds, slowly but steadily.  It makes me feel even better when others have noticed my weight loss and have asked me what I'm taking.  They're surprised something so easy works.Lastly, when I told my husband I'm taking these pills, he asked me to stop because he doesn't trust any diet pills.  My scientist husband reads all the ingredients before I take any pills.  He gave me the thumbs up on this PM formula.  Surprised?

"The PA system is really nice.  Not an issue.  But if you were looking into this particular model with the throat mic, then I recommend saving your money and buy the Audio2000 unit without one.  The throat mic doesn't pick up audio as well as the standard mics that comes with this system.  Also your neck needs to be a certain size for this to even remain on while talking.  For me, the throat mic is too big.  I had to secure it in other ways and my voice sounded like I came down with  a cold.  Compared to the other mics that comes with this system, to pay extra for the throat mic is not a worthwhile investment.  Otherwise than that, I really love this PA system.  Simple, easy to use.

"I purchased these based on the great reviews on Amazon.  When I received the burp clothes they were great.  Small but very absorbent.  Then after a few washes, the threads started showing.  After I cut the loose threads, and wash them some more, it's falling apart more.  I don't even bother cutting the threads anymore.Burp clothes must be able to handle constant washings and these do not hold up.  I'm very disappointed.  In addition, they were already small to begin with and now they shrink some more.  With the loose threads and the shrinkage, I won't have much to work with anymore.  Considering they were $10 for something that lasted a month, it's not worth the money.My friend ended up recommending burp clothes by Ikea.  I purchased a few and they were double the size of the Dundee Burp Clothes and are just as absorbent.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQCW6FLNBN3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016A7QYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IQCW6FLNBN3B","A2MLUAAQFEB6WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MLUAAQFEB6WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is something weird with the pricing of this cable version when the 6inch model costs more than the 4ft model. On the other hand, this is a quality cable, I tested it and it works with iPhones 5S, 6 and 6Plus without any hint of trouble. I like the fact that the gold model matches very well with the gold iPhone models - the 6inch version is very useful to use with an external battery pack in keeping cable clutter to a minimum in your pocket. The cable is much more solid looking and feeling than the standard iPhone cables, yet it still fits and works well with all the very skinny and tight cases I found on the various iPhone models in my home. I like it because it is a quality cable, but pricing wise it is not a great value - this is closer to Monster Cable style pricing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOEWXW0O3K2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTXV3ZS#wasThisHelpful","RIOEWXW0O3K2P","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once upon a time there used to be just one version of Dreft and that is what we used for the baby until he could start crawling, and then we switched to regular and much cheaper detergents. This Stage 2 formula I think is an attempt to capture that market of people who are quick to switch to regular detergents for toddler laundry needs. This claims to be better on food stains, but I am not sure what the reference for ""better"" is - it certainly doesn't appear to be making a noticeable difference vs the regular Dreft detergent; at any rate nowhere near close to results one can get from Tide Ultra or other top rated products. This version appears to be more concentrated than regular Dreft, as the doses are much smaller for a regular load of laundry. I found the scent to be pretty much the same diaper clean scent, only more powerful; no matter where you have the laundry room in your house, the whole house will know when you do a load of this. I know it is hard to evaluate a detergent effectiveness objectively, but for me this one doesn't stand out either in results or value; a middling performance at premium prices make for a tough sell.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Z4WFG6A1JBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB7422U#wasThisHelpful","R22Z4WFG6A1JBO","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used this mount for a slim (2""  thick) NVR recorder and it works out great. The pictures are always showing the brackets with some device being held, so naturally I expected to get quite a bit of heft and metal in the package when I ordered. When it arrived it was very compactly packed, to the point where I had to check that all six bracket parts are included in the shrink plastic. The assembly is very easy, the mounting was simple and if you happen to find a stud for one or two of the mounting holes then you can hang quite a bit of weight on this. This is a great design because it allows the units to circulate air and ventilate according to their specs. In all I am hanging about 16lbs from this bracket (NVR, power brick switch and power brick) and I don't have the slightest worry about having my equipment stick to the wall like I installed it for the long run.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLURHE2XOTKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWUQEFU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZLURHE2XOTKD","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used this to replace a regular dimmer in my office because - well, I am lazy and I find that getting up from the chair to turn on the lights from the switch across the room to be a bothersome exercise. Installation and setup went fine for me and the switch works as advertised. The only problem I have is that it seems to be overly sensitive to the amount of light in the room on deciding whether to turn on the lights or not. I have dual screen monitors facing which project some light around the room, and if I have anything with a white background the lights will stay off pretty late into the evening, and switching away from a white background to the darker desktop will result in having the lights immediately come on - which  is kind of an unintended and weird ""remote"" effect.The occupancy sensor is kind of a miss for me. I do like to use the TruColor LEDs (using the TW series from Cree currently) and these seem to play games with the occupancy sensor. It does work most of the time as a motion sensor, but you do have to keep moving because if you just sit typing in front of a computer it will time out on you and turn off the lights. That does not happen if I switch to incandescent bulbs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHRSSJAWT9AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAO4NUM#wasThisHelpful","R3AHRSSJAWT9AL","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The main advantage of this glider versus the more usual swing-type products seems to be (at least in my case0 that the bay tolerates it much better. because you don't have the centrifugal force which is present in a swing, the baby seems to actually enjoy the experience. The only indication in the packaging for the recommended maximum age is ""don't use it with infants which are can crawl, although practically speaking at around 6 months or so this is becoming obsolete. The glider is smooth and works well; the speed selectors range from ""nice"" at the lowest setting to ""don't use"" for the medium to ""no freaking way"" at the high speed setting. The glide motion is fluid, but after about 3 weeks of use my unit has developed a slight jerking motion when it changes direction at the end of one run - I don't remember that being there when I first started to use it. As the baby gains in weight this will probably become more and more evident.The soother was very easy to assemble and all the soft materials are easy to take out for washing. The unit had a battery compartment for the music and nature sounds only; the gliding motion only works while plugged in. Overall I like it very much because my baby enjoys spending time in it, but I cannot give a full 5 stars because of the slight change in the fluidity of the glide when changing direction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OI58V6XTFP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETJCS#wasThisHelpful","R3OI58V6XTFP1","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are 3 frying pans (8/10/12 inch, without lids) and 4 pots (1.5, 2.5, 3 and 6 qt, with lids). I would have liked it if the frying pans would have had lids as well, or if the lid from the dutch oven would fit the 10 inch pan.The pots are well made, the thick material is a great conductor and retainer of heat. With the exception of the glass lids everything is oven safe to very high temperatures (550F). The glass lids should be good to about 350F. The handles are sturdy and I have found them to stay comfortably low temp during stove-top cooking. I have been putting these through daily use and the pots show no signs of wear and/or staining, which seem to indicate a very good quality stainless as well.I am decking a star from my rating because I would really like to have the lids interchangeable between the pots and pans - I would really like for the frying pans to have a lid cover option as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HCIHRUDUN2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGYV53G#wasThisHelpful","R9HCIHRUDUN2H","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It doesn't take much handling and poking around to come to the conclusion that these are a quality and well engineered set of pliers. There is not the slightest amount of wobble, the handles are pretty much perfect to handle. The cutter is perfectly machined and aligned; the long pliers tips are again perfectly aligned and grip with a solid feeling which is sure to make these pliers last a long time. If you ever had the misfortune of handling one of the bargain-bin pliers from the big home improvement stores then you will really appreciate the step up in quality and workmanship of the IRWIN pliers.I also like the tool wrap they come in - that too is a quality item and it takes very little space in the tool box, while keeping all the pliers together.

"I got this bag because I thought it to be the most practical for a quick business one-two nights trip. Unlike so many other laptop overnighter bags, this one has a good sized compartment for clothing and you can easily pack two days worth of stuff. As far as the space is concerned, the bag is as close to ideal as possible. However, there are some poor design choices and it is surprising for a Samsonite bag of this price range:- the laptop compartment is lightly padded, but it has no straps to keep the laptop in, no pockets, nothing. It is ideally suited for carrying folders and papers, but if you have a smaller laptop it will bounce around freely in that compartment.- the smaller pocket in front of the bag only has zippers to about a third of the way down, so it doesn't really open more than 4-5 inches at the top when its zippers are ""all the way open"". That makes it really hard to operate inside and perform the ""where the darn USB stick"" search ritual.- the telescopic arm feels a bit flimsy - it is made out of five segments and it is choke-full of hard plastic parts which usually end up breaking over the repeated use. (It just happened to me on the previous Samsonite wheeled laptop bag I had, but that one was a cheaper model with a shorter warranty. That is why I decided to move to a premium line. Needless to say, I am disappointed to see that with today's Samsonite, more money does not buy you better quality)- the most disappointing of all, the zippers - more precisely, the pullers. These are made out of rubbery plastic with a metal paint. It doesn't take a well traveled person or a rocket scientist to know these won't last past a six month mark, if that. I don't understand why Samsonite would stoop so low and compromise on the quality of their zippers.Overall though this is a very practical wheeled bag for me, so I will keep it.

"This is a very strong magnetic holder. Mounting it is very easy if you know how to find your studs. Stud mounting is recommended - the magnets are quite strong on this unit, so it will take a bit of force to pry the tools off once they're attached.On the downsides of this, the bar has a bit of heft to it (feels a bit over two pounds) and it is kind of short at about 17"".

"This is truly a very good sounding speaker bar. I got this installed replacing a Samsung HW-H550 sound bar system to compare it and this does sound better. The subwoofer blends in better, it is harder to spot the moment when the subwoofer ""takes over"" from the speakers in the sound bar. The Samsung had a better and more expansive 3D effect, but that could very well be because in the Samsung I had the choice of feeding a digital signal through an HDMI port. In the Energy CS-30 there is no HDMI port, there is no coaxial port. There is an optical TOSlink port, but neither my TV or my receiver had the option of producing output on an optical link, so I could not test a digital signal.I found the sound up and down the range to be very well balanced. The lows are solid and the sub can and will shake your room if you crank it up. The trebles are light and very well articulated, not muffled like in the Samsung H550. Overall I have no complaints about the sound quality in my setup (other than the gimmicky 3D effects which I don't use anyway). This is a good sound, period, without having to add any meta-disclaimers like ""for the price"". The speech comes through clearly in the movies and the fact that the system can be used independently as a Bluetooth receiver makes it easy to play stuff from a tabled or phone without having to power on a whole bunch of additional equipment.One of the weak points of the system is the remote, which is too small and and has those lentil-sized buttons that are so annoying to press. Another one is that the sound bar and the subwoofer have to be powered off separately - I have the subwoofer placed in the back of the room to take advantage of its wireless nature, and when powering off the system I have to aim the little remote at both the soundbar and the sub separately. Another annoyance is the lack of an HDMI port, Some of its competitors have an HDMI pass-through capability which would make things much easier. Most receivers are already capable of decoding complex sound and feeding digital PCM through the output/monitor port - and HDMI cable would make getting a digital signal to the soundbar much easier.Overall though, I like this set and I will leave it on instead of the Samsung soundbar, even though this means I will forever keep obsessing over the fact that I am feeding my sound system through the old style RCA ports instead of using a digital signal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W94C81VPP37Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P66QSN6#wasThisHelpful","R1W94C81VPP37Q","A1AWL9JASMG904","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AWL9JASMG904?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These ""literary works"" are mind-bogglingly stupid, truly breathtakingly awful. These are chock-full of bad grammar, words you'd rather not hear a six year old use, attitudes which drive most well-adjusted parents up the nearest wall. As I flipped through the pages I kept imagining all the pauses I'd have to make while reading this to my kid (""well, Junie B does this, but we know it's not okay to [headbutt someone, use the word stupid, be disrespectful to teachers, etc]""). Every page would require such a detour and adjustment to make sure the kid gets the message one wants to deliver. And I don't know about other kids, but at least with my little once you give him a stupid idea (to use a word which shows up repeatedly in this series), it is really darn hard to get him not to act on it at some later time, no matter how much coaching goes with it. These books are filled to the brim with such bad ideas and attitudes. I am dumbfounded that these books are so popular in schools; but I'd  rather have my precious snowflake learn these bad things in school from other kids rather than enable him to be the instigator and *teach* bad behaviors to others in school.

"This is a good quality pruner; despite its name it is really what one would expect to be a full size pruner. This arrived in time for my annual chopping down of the Christmas tree work - and if you ever needed to make a large tree fit into a very small ""garden refuse"" bin then you know that the resin put out by the pine tree branches will clog every pruner ever made. This one fared as best as one could hope for under the circumstances. The nonstick coating helps it through a large number of cuts, but eventually you do have to stop work and clean it because the pine resin doesn't seem to care about non-stickiness. It cuts through the thicker branches with relative ease and the blade stayed sharp through the end.

"I am very impressed with the quality, appearance, and functionality of the iGT touch screen texting leather gloves. These are a huge upgrade to the synthetic fabric texting gloves I purchased in the past. They are so much nicer than the pictures shown in the listing.

They are perfect for a night out on the town, as well as business professionals.  I purchased mine at a discounted price, but that does not affect my review. I  absolutely love and recommend them!

"I purchased Keraplex Organica Shampoo at a discounted price for review purposes. My daughter has always had extremely thick hair until the last few months. She has been under tremendous stress lately, resulting in hair loss by the handful! She has been using this shampoo since mid April, and we have seen great results. Her hair is thicker, shinier, and healthier now. But the real proof is that the bathtub drain hasn't been clogged by her hair in almost a month!!! I recommend this product. I do want to add that she has also started taking a multi-vitamin daily.

"As someone with dry, sensitive, mature skin, as well as sensitive eyes, this eye gel is perfect for me! It has a true gel consistency with a white opaque appearance. One pump is more than enough per application. I apply it every morning and evening. It goes on very smoothly, absorbs completely, and leaves no tacky or sticky residue behind. It has a light and fresh cucumber scent that dissipates quickly. This eye gel has lightened my dark circles, and given me a more youthful appearance by firming my skin. I look refreshed and rested with the puffiness gone. I love every Majestic Pure product I have used, and this eye gel is no exception. They seem to research their formulas very well before offering them to the public. I was very impressed by this particular product's ingredients. They included the ingredient, Resistem to this formula, which has been scientifically proven to activate our skin's defensive and protective mechanisms against aging-which means it actually is healing and repairing. It's first aid for my skin! It also contains Hyaluronic Acid which hydrates, moisturizes, and plumps our skin, giving it a dewy and youthful appearance. Matrixyl 3000 is added to help firm our skin.

"I purchased Wake Up Sense Progesterone Cream because I have horrible night sweats that wake me up in the middle of the night, and then find it impossible to get back to sleep, which leads to my fatigue and irritability. It a vicious cycle, but thank goodness I made the right decision in buying it, because it has worked miracles for me...no more night sweats! I'm sleeping through the night and have more energy, which makes me a much happier person! How could a cream work this well, I thought to myself, so I did some online research. This is a summary of what I learned: Progesterone is a hormone found in both men and women, and is essential for maintaining good health. A progesterone deficiency can affect our reproductive organs(obviously), but it also affects the functions of our brain, nervous system, heart & circulatory system, immune system, digestive tract, bones, and liver. Some of the signs and symptoms of a deficiency in progesterone are: fatigue, anxiety, nervousness, moodiness, irritability, low sex drive, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, depression, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, weight gain, headaches/migraines, difficulty falling and staying asleep, bloating, chronic constipation, painful breast lumps,and decreased bone density. If you're experiencing any of these, I recommend trying this cream. It's an excellent safe and natural alternative to traditional medicine. I received mine at a discounted price, but that doesn't affect my review. I love, and recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSWKSISQ8LZ9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCWLVPE#wasThisHelpful","RSWKSISQ8LZ9H","A22OAIWC3E7A0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22OAIWC3E7A0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mint flavored liquid spray is formulated with Vitamins D3 and K2. The dosage recommendation is 4 sprays by mouth two times a  day. The size of the container is about the size of a tube of mascara, so  by using it as recommended,(8 sprays in total per day), it definitely won't last very long. On the plus side, it easily fits into my pocket or purse, which is great for me!  As someone with multiple sclerosis, accompanied by a vitamin D deficiency, I have taken vitamin D supplements for years. I prefer the liquid over pill form, because liquid vitamin D enters your system immediately and is fast acting. I did some online research, and this is a summary of what I learned: Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is produced in our skin in response to sunlight. That's why it's referred to as the Sunshine Vitamin, but with people using sunscreen to decrease the risk of skin cancer, it's necessary to find your daily recommended allowance through food, and vitamin supplements as well. It's found in fortfied milk, egg yolks, salmon, sardines, and shrimp. It's hard to get enough Vitamin D through sun exposure and food alone, so I was very happy to receive this product at a discounted price, which in no way affects my review. As well as being necessary for bone and teeth health which most people already know, Vitamin D also functions to regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorous, and to facilitate normal immune system function, reducing the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, heart disease, and decreasing the likelihood of catching the flu. Vitamin K2 is also a fat soluble vitamin that helps to maintain bone strength and health, and works to keep arteries clear, in addition to helping calcium travel to bones and teeth. So this little spray packs quite a punch, don't you think?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4OTE5KJVOTJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J61XT48#wasThisHelpful","R4OTE5KJVOTJV","A22OAIWC3E7A0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22OAIWC3E7A0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These vitamins have a gummy bear shape and are raspberry flavored, along with a children's chewable vitamin taste. So, they definitely don't taste like candy, but they don't taste horrible either, which is a very good thing! Vitamins have 2 categories: water soluble, and fat soluble. Water soluble vitamins are excreted through urine, and are relatively safe if taken in excess of the recommended daily allowance. Fat soluble vitamins are Vitamins A,D,E, and K. Our bodies store fat-soluble vitamins in our fat cells and our liver. It's important not to take excessive doses of fat-soluble vitamin supplements, because they remain stored in our body, and could cause adverse health effects. Being a nurse, I just wanted to remind everyone to always keep these out of your children's reach. OK, back to the product review... They do not contain artificial colors, preservatives, gluten, nuts, eggs, dairy, or soy. What they do contain are the vitamins and minerals our children need, especially these days where both parents work outside of the home, and home cooked meals with fresh vegetables aren't always possible.

"Wisdom beard oil has a masculine scent of spruce, lemon and cedar that's definitely present. The scent is welcoming, but not overpowering. However, when he's using this beard oil, I asked my boyfriend not to use his cologne, because the two scents do clash. It only takes a dime sized amount that he pours into his palm, then works it into his beard, and he finishes off by using his beard brush to tame it to perfection. His routine leaves him with a sexy healthy shine, and it's so soft that I can't resist gently running my fingers through it! Wisdom Beard Oil is made with olive, grapeseed, apricot, jojoba, and argan oils, vitamin E, and cedar, lemon, and spruce essential oils. That's it- all natural and organic ingredients! Plus it's blended and bottled by hand right here in the good old U.S.A. When he does wear cologne, he uses CanYouHandlebar's Temperance beard oil because it's unscented, and works just as well as the Wisdom beard oil. My boyfriend really loves CanYouHandlebar products. He also has the beard brush, primary and secondary mustache waxes. and wax lifter/picks. We received this beard oil at a discounted price, but that does not affect my review. We love this company's products & courteous service, and highly recommend! CanYouHandlebar followed up via email with some very helpful beard grooming tips after we received my boyfriend's Wisdom Beard Oil. I would like to share them: BeardsStart with a clean (and ideally towel-dry) beard. When applying traditional beard oil or beard dry oil, always be sure to start at the ends of your facial hair and work in towards your face. The ends of the hairs are in need of the most nourishment and using this application method is an easy way to get the most out of your purchase.Take care to ensure your moustache is thoroughly coated as well, brush or comb your beard from the bottom up to work the product through it and then use a brush, comb or your hands to give your beard a shape you will be proud to wear all day.Both the traditional beard oil and beard dry oil can be easily applied with a beard oil brush or with your hands.

"Fractionated Coconut Oil from Pure Body Naturals Review:  Fractionated Coconut Oil is not like other oils because it's shelf life is indefinite when you store it in a cool dry cabinet. One of the things I love about this colorless, unscented oil is that it produces a protective barrier without irritating my sensitive skin or clogging my pores, and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and hydrated with no greasy feeling. Fractionated Coconut Oil is not like regular coconut oil that goes solid at room temperature although it's ability as an emollient and moisturizer is the same. It stays liquid, is clear, and is great for use in DIY creams, lotions, body & facial scrubs, and other cosmetic recipes for your skin and hair. It absorbs deeply into the skin, making it my very favorite carrier oil for essential oils! This also makes an excellent massage oil carrier base for your essential oils, with my personal favorite being this coconut oil with adding several drops of essential peppermint oil to make my own massage oil for tired, achy muscles. It doesn't stain fabric and it easily washes out of clothing and sheets! If you do a goggle search, you can find so many great DIY(do it yourself) formulas/recipes for fractionated coconut oil.

"I love the fresh, clean scent of Essential Lemon Oil! I feel refreshed and energized when I use it. You can use it in so many ways: Use it as a skin toner for oily and acne prone skin by diluting it in purified water and spritzing on your face, avoiding your eyes. A word of warning though, when using lemon oil on your skin, avoid exposure to direct sunlight for 12 hours after applying it. It's best to dilute lemon oil with purified water or carrier oils(I dilute mine with fractionated coconut oil). For oily hair, add a few drops to your shampoo, or massage several drops that have been diluted in water into your scalp when you shower. For cold sores, make a lip balm by diluting lemon oil with coconut oil. When used as aromatherapy, it's very beneficial for anxiety, depression, and stress. Add five or six drops in with your vaporizer for colds and respiratory illnesses, And, of course it's great for cleaning your home since it has natural antiseptic and disinfectant properties, especially since the winter season has arrived!

"I got this for my granddaughter for use with her iPod. I love that it has a LED display that shows you how much power is remaining. Recharging it is as easy as plugging it into your computer or a USB wall charger. By using this charger, her iPod gets a full charge. This is a powerful little charger, and exceeded my expectations!

"I use this serum every morning and night; applying along my upper lash lines and my eyebrows by using the applicator brush. I allow it to dry before applying my skincare products. I'm beginning to notice new growth in my brows, something I thought to be impossible, because I plucked them for so many years! I've noticed less improvement with my eyelashes than my eyebrows, however there is still some improvement. They are a little thicker, and a tiny bit longer. This serum has not caused redness, itching, burning or irritation to my sensitive skin or eyes, I love the fact that this serum is made in the U.S.A. and is not tested on animals.

"These are very good markers.They are really simple to use- as simple as using a pen, but the finished appearance looks just like chalk! I use them on chalkboard labels. Once the marker paint is dry, it's basically smudge-proof.

"I've never used a skincare product that contains some of these ingredients, one being gotu kola. Gotu kola  stimulates collagen production, which preserves, restores, and hydrates skin. Horsetail is another ingredient that I was unfamiliar with. It's high in silica, which enhances collagen production as well. So basically, those two ingredients work to  improve my skin's elasticity. Wild geranium works to distribute melanin evenly in the skin which gives my skin an even color. Dandelion is rich is anti oxidants, especially vitamin-C to lighten discoloration. This moisturizer absorbs completely into my dry and sensitive skin, leaving it soft, smooth, supple, and radiant. I received mine at a discounted price, but that doesn't affect my review.

"The Amazon listing reads: Designed specifically for the modern warrior who needs to change at a moments notice. Prepare for another day of crushing victories...Well, you'll have to battle this warrior princess over this absolutely amazing shampoo and conditioner! Yes, I'm a woman, and I use both the shampoo, and conditioner. They have a wonderful peppermint scent that lingers for hours. It's not an overpowering scent, just a mildly pleasant scent that causes my boyfriend to hug me a little longer than before I started using it, followed by complimenting me on how great I smell! I would share my shampoo and conditioner with him, but the longer hugs and compliments may cease. I will never admit to him these products I'm using are advertised for men. I will admit, I bought my ex-boyfriend a bottle of the shampoo a while back, When we split up, he left the shampoo behind. I ran out of my shampoo, and used the bottle he left behind. Now I'm hooked! I have long hair that's color-processed, and the combination of the shampoo and conditioner has made it much softer, silkier, and shiny. I've gotten so many compliments since I've started using it.

"Recently I spent some time researching peppermint oil online. I knew it was beneficial for asthma, which is what I normally use it for, by adding drops of it into sterile water in my vaporizer. But, I was amazed at the many other benefits it offers! It is useful in the treatment of arthritic pain, bronchitis, cold sores, congestion, fever, foot soaks, flu, halitosis (bad breath), headaches, herpes, hives, itching, lice, motion sickness, muscle aches, and sinusitis. It is also used in aromatherapy to soothe the mind and body. Another use is pest control for ants, bedbugs, fleas, tics, flies, mosquitoes, roaches, rodents, and spiders. I found this information by doing a google search, typing in: benefits of peppermint oil. Since this is therapeutic grade, not food grade, I will not be using it internally. Also, I will not be applying it by itself on my skin. It is an essential oil, meaning it is highly concentrated and should never be put on the skin without mixing it with a carrier oil. I combine a few drops to Fractionated Coconut Oil for use as a massage oil which is great for my arthritic pain!. As I stated earlier. I use it in my vaporizer, and it works amazingly well. So well, in fact, that I rarely use my rescue inhaler. This huge 4 ounce bottle will last a long time! I received mine at a discounted price, however that does not affect my review.

"VA has a good quality aluminium herb grinder with it's friction-free operation. It grinds very smoothly and evenly, having extremely sharp cutting blades. It grinds consistently giving you fluffy herbs with every use. It has enough room to hold a lot of herbs because it has deep reservoirs that collect the herb and pollen. It has a stainless steel mesh screen that filters the finest pollen to the bottom.  Magnets help to keep it closed tightly to maintain freshness and control odor.

"Abundant Living's Natural Diatomaceous Earth Powder is a safe, non-toxic product that will not harm humans, animals, or birds.

"This vest is wonderfully unique, and I really loved the details - there is a little gold bell attached to each bear's bow tie and it jingles. There's a lot to the design, but it doesn't seem too busy (and doesn't make me feel dizzy). In addition to being beautiful, it's thick and feels solid, not like it will fall apart after one day of wear. I wasn't sure what size to choose, so I went up a size and am glad I did - the vest doesn't necessarily seem to be made on the small side, but I like the longer length of a size bigger, and there's a little more room to move around, especially considering the top I'll wear underneath. If you like your vests snug and not at all loose, the size top you usually wear should work fine.I mainly bought this sweater vest because I wanted something dressier to wear to work, and this is exactly what I wanted. I'm very happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJGUYZR04HIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKU89BI#wasThisHelpful","R1PJGUYZR04HIB","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Anna and the Swallow Man"" is a haunting story told in such beautiful, lyrical language - it felt like I was reading a work of art that possessed a lot of heart and soul. There was a depth to this children's story I found surprising, as well - it's a thoughtful book that explores the horror, terror, hunger, violence and death of war with just enough hope, songs, sweet surprises and questions with interesting answers that readers don't feel crushed under the heaviness of the constant struggle to survive.Anna is 7 when her father leaves for a meeting at work and never returns. She meets a man who helps her overcome her fear by sharing his special language with the swallows. In Anna's eyes, the man resembles King Solomon. But the tall, thin, wise man who speaks not only Bird, but countless other languages as well (just like her father, and she too can speak many of the languages) convinces Anna to compromise and call him the Swallow Man or Daddy.The Swallow Man teaches Anna the language of Road, and the two walk the Polish (and briefly, Soviet) roads,towns and through the woods, and then they walk more, in their quest to survive. Through the years, Anna (who gives her name to the Swallow Man in exchange for the name Sweetie) asks questions, the Swallow Man answers, and the two develop a family and bond that isn't easily broken. Anna isn't the only one capable of learning lessons from the Swallow Man, as is evidenced when Anna makes a new friend. Sometimes it's difficult to endure something you don't like or approve of to please someone else, but it's an unspoken lesson that was told beautifully, with some humor and hope mixed in with the hardships.Death, illness and tragedy are dealt with realistically and compassionately; there are no pat, easy answers and sometimes Anna, her friend, or the Swallow Man's anguish are keen and deeply felt - it's part of what made the book more treasure-worthy, the wide range of honest and frequently bold or raw emotions. The only part of the story I struggled a bit to understand was the ending. But after thinking about it, I did finally comprehend and make some sense of it - I just didn't particularly like it. The ending fit in well with the Swallow Man's personality and Road lessons (one of which involves the importance of questions and the ability to keep asking them). I really wanted a few less questions, though (or just a few more answers!) and a bit more satisfaction in the end, but hey, life, in this case Anna's and the Swallow Man's, often is not like that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17H61ICDAPU4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553513346#wasThisHelpful","R17H61ICDAPU4X","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved ""Warren the 13th and the All-Seeing Eye"" - more than I anticipated I would. The story is warm and charming, yet really quite smart (there are many good concepts to contemplate - such as family legacies and tradition; what the phrases ""love is blind"" and ""don't judge a book by its cover"" mean). The book would be fun to use when discussing fairy tales (are there others, such as Cinderella, that Warren reminds a reader of? How are the characters the same? How are they different?) I found myself guessing and making predictions about what might happen next (I was usually wrong, but it was still fun). There's also some interesting vocabulary, such as ""menaced,"" ""confers,"" ""betrayal"" - it didn't feel as though young readers were being talked ""down"" to and that was pretty cool. Warren comes across as smart, as well as hard-working, adventurous and friendly.There is some fine humor and some very mysterious, curious, quirky characters in this book, and I thought the cast really worked well together with a well-paced, interesting plot, to produce an engaging story. The art is truly amazing and eye-grabbing, as well - not to give away the exact details of the illustrations, but the colors used are perfect. Warren is one of those rare characters with a story that drew me in so well that I'd love to stay at his hotel - can't wait to visit him again in the next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27D92L35VB85U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594748039#wasThisHelpful","R27D92L35VB85U","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Hershey-Ets tasted good and fresh - for a little piece of candy, I liked the punch of the big chocolate taste and the crunchy candy coating. The tin isn't elaborate or fancy, but I liked it well enough because it seals tightly and serves its purpose well, which is protecting the Ets and helping ensure the candy stays fresh. There is a thick white plastic liner in the tin as added protection. When I first opened the tin, all I could see were smooth-looking, whole red and green Ets - there were very few pieces that were broken or chipped, and those were at the bottom, which is understandable.

"Eliana is the only female private investigator in the domed Hope City, Antarctica. She's good at her job, and she hopes to earn enough for a ticket out of the dome and into the mainland, even if that means leaving her boyfriend, Diego, who's an errand runner for Ignacio Cabrera, the city's crime boss. When Lady Luna, a beautiful and wealthy aristocrat, comes to Eliana with an unusual assignment, earning a big chunk of money toward her escape is the biggest motivator for Eliana to accept the job, which turns out to be more dangerous than she imagined.While Eliana completes her mission for Lady Luna (who prefers to be called Marianella), a friendship develops between the two women. Eliana learns secrets about Marianella she must decide whether she can keep; meanwhile, Marianella is trying to unravel a mystery involving her dangerous friend, Sofia, and what exactly she's doing in the abandoned amusement park with maintenance drones, and robots such as android Luciano, who's been programmed to help people but still manages to think for himself and go against orders from time to time.Elaina's life crumbles when she discovers Diego's betrayal; but can she still save his life? The book moves along at a smooth, interesting pace. Each character mostly has a distinct personality, with an interesting blend or balance between good and evil. However, Cabrera is not deeply drawn and feels like a somewhat dull, stereotypical villain. Although the action is fairly original and fast-paced, some of the reactions were repeated so many times they became monotonous and lost their appeal. Overall, it felt like a good effort to tell an unusual story about what it means to be human in a world where those humans who appear to be friends may not be, and where robots might have more in their programs than blindly following humankind's orders. The big question is, as the humans and robots each work toward their own different ideas of freedom and success, is there a way for them to work together, or are they ultimately rivals?","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFSYJEY2EASAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481444263#wasThisHelpful","RFSYJEY2EASAH","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like more than the appearance of this design, which is a bit unique, simple yet eye-catching; I like the way it's molded into a barely perceptible half-sphere - this seems to keep the necklace from constantly flipping over from front to back. The round knotted design isn't heavy, yet it's solid and doesn't fly around when you're moving or working, which I liked.The only thing I immediately wasn't sure about was the chain. It's very, very thin, and I was afraid it would break easily. The clasp is nice, solid and easy to use. I did note after wearing it awhile that the chain seemed stronger than it looks - and the clasp didn't move around to get caught next to the designed part, which I liked.

"I have another Downton Abbey necklace/earring set and really, really liked it, so I bought this one, too, wanting to expand my collection. I have to admit, when I first opened the box, I was a little disappointed. The product picture is a little misleading, probably because it's enlarged to show the details and it does look sparklier in the picture than it looks in the box. The blue stone, especially, just looks dull (in the earrings especially). But when I took the necklace out of the box, I liked it more. After wearing it, I like it much, much better (it feels solid yet comfortable, with a good clasp and weight overall, and I love how it's designed because the flower is fixed in place and doesn't move around - you don't have that annoying clasp that moves until it's in the front right next to the flower).The earrings also looked much nicer in my ears than in the box.

"Mitch Albom has a flair for writing warm, personal stories that have a freshness and depth to them. ""The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto"" is no exception. Readers don't need to have an affection for or a deep interest in music to see and feel the connections in this book, but it probably adds a bit of spark if there's some kind of appreciation for music.This story tells Frankie's life and the impact it had on people close to him, and those who were at a distance. Not only does the story explore the importance and magic of music, it wraps up a deep and abiding love which isn't perfect but doesn't pretend or assume it is, in music's embrace, as well. Every aspect, positive or negative, triumph or defeat, is somehow connected to the music in Frankie's soul. Music is one of the narrators of Frankie's life story, as a matter of fact.Many people tell Frankie's story - from a variety of musicians (most that people will recognize), to Music, to an unknown narrator who fills in some blanks in Frankie's timeline. Usually, the story flows well and the change in narrators is fluid and easy to follow. Once, somewhere in the middle of Frankie's story, I stumbled a little with a time change, but quickly caught up with where I should be.I enjoyed this uplifting story about how a boy grows into a man and discovers he possesses magic guitar strings and finally realizes what those magic strings mean. It was a fun yet fulfilling story that gave me plenty to think (and feel) about without being preachy or over-done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BR2YTSL890KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294415#wasThisHelpful","R2BR2YTSL890KO","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband was impressed with this knife and began carrying it immediately. When I asked him why he liked it, he listed the following positives about this knife:* It's mega-thin, lightweight and fits in his hand well. It's good for everyday use (and being so thin, it's not bulky to carry in a pocket).* Even though it's small, the knife opens into a nice-sized blade.* It has a unique, boxy look.* The liner lock and the blade were sturdy.* The knife opened and closed easily - there was a little stiffness because the knife is new, but with use, it should become smoother.* There's a lanyard hole.* The thumb hole is spacious and long.Overall, this knife is a prized addition to my husband's knife collection. He said he wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for gift-giving and would buy another one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIRZXX3OK4HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QYHML4#wasThisHelpful","R2EIRZXX3OK4HE","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, I am one of those people who's always cold - summer (in the air conditioning) as well as winter. So, I have had quite a few different heaters, even taking one to work when I was permitted. This little Vornado is not only attractive and very easy to move (light-weight) and transport (compact), it's easy to use. It does exactly what it's supposed to do (heat a room), and it does this quietly.Although the heat coming out isn't forceful (you can't feel it across the room), you can feel a noticeable difference in the warmth of the room you're heating when you come in from another room. I also can sit very close to it and enjoy the warmth without feeling stifled. My husband is the opposite of me and very rarely cold, but he likes to use the Vornado on cold evenings - just on his feet. He likes being able to move it easily so he can control where he wants the warm air to go - since it's not forceful air, people who aren't as chilled all the time can still enjoy it in smaller doses and aimed in a particular direction without feeling overheated. I've used the Vornado in my library (the size of a bedroom) and my bedroom, and within 10 minutes, the chill is gone from the room and I can feel warmth coming out into the hallway. The Vornado is so quiet you forget it's there.There are four buttons on the Vornado - a power button, a hot./fan air button, and a + and a - for up and down in the temperature. If the heater tips, it shuts off automatically, and there's a countdown of 8 seconds when you turn it off until it powers down. The Vornado is a great addition to our household and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it as a gift for loved ones seeking a reliable, easy-to-use and very quiet room heater.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CIN859YSXY12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVIOFNG#wasThisHelpful","R1CIN859YSXY12","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually very much like the heaviness (makes me think of solid and dependable) and the feel of this watch, and it's a gorgeous, high-quality watch. While I don't mind the oversize aspect of the watch, I have a tiny wrist, so this watch slipped right off and there is no adjustment in the band at all. I wanted to wear it immediately, and have always taken my own links out of watches in the past, but this wasn't an option for this watch. There were no instructions for removing links in the enclosed booklet, which really isn't a big deal with the easy access to the internet to mine for information. My husband, who is excellent at fixing almost anything, knew how to remove the links and has amassed a large collection of tools over the years. But he didn't own a small enough tool to remove the links - though he tried repeatedly with a variety of smaller tools he did have. After shattering a needle from my sewing kit, he finally gave up. I know it should not be a big deal to take it to a jeweler's, but I did find it a bit of a hassle and inconvenient - plus, not every place of business will take care of pieces of jewelry if you didn't purchase it there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F39ALUSIF4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y7OK#wasThisHelpful","R2F39ALUSIF4P","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Free Men"" has an engaging, interesting storyline. Three men, at a time when it might seem unlikely or odd for these three who look so vastly different on the outside to be in any way associated with one another, travel at some length together. They've been accused of committing a crime, and an investigator (or tracker) who is as curious about human behavior as he is about justice, is on their trail.There is something additional, something beyond the interesting storyline. I liked the way the story was told and unfolded (each of the three men, the investigator and another person, briefly, all take turns sharing their stories). The reader is with the characters in the present, but also with each of them in the past as the men share their histories and what paths they trod upon that might have led to the path they all found themselves on together. The men's voices and stories are all very personal, often thoughtful and reflective and show that the men have magnetic personalities with depth to them. Their stories are colorful and full of action. The men also ask really good questions - if not of themselves, then in discussions with one another. For example, which would you choose - to have a cruel family (or to have a big, loving family and lose every single one of them), or to be alone and lonely? Different men choose different answers and it's interesting to see why and to think about your own life and which answer you might believe to be true.I'm glad I invested time in this book and would recommend it to anyone because it's got something for everyone, from the fast-paced story and plenty of action, to the endless big and little questions life throws at us all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBN9HA65AEW4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062407597#wasThisHelpful","RBN9HA65AEW4X","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Searcher"" is an engaging read that has a fast-paced, well-developed plot, a decent-sized cast of enigmatic characters that are still easy to follow, get to know and remember as you're reading, and enough suspense to keep you turning the pages.I liked the various mysteries within the story - Is there hidden treasure tied to the town of Redemption? Who is Solomon Creed, why does he appear in Redemption in the middle of the chaos of a plane crash and fire, and why is he trying to save a man who's already dead (and what does the ""I"" burned into his flesh mean)? Did cartel leader Papa Tio's son die in the plane crash near Redemption, and if so, was it an accident or something more sinister? What is Papa Tio planning in retaliation? Are the mayor and police chief of Redemption involved somehow with Papa Tio - or the plane crash?I enjoyed the different perspectives in the story - the chapters are very brief and easy to read - and the stories or voices change between Solomon, the founder of the town/church of Redemption, the police chief and/or mayor, and Papa Tio and those around him. The action and suspense are nonstop and just enough answers offered at just the right time to bring the completed picture into focus, albeit with maybe a few pieces missing or cast in shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R324MJE2PPN8LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062329723#wasThisHelpful","R324MJE2PPN8LU","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""An Inheritance of Ashes,"" told in 16-year-old Hallie's voice and seen through her eyes (both the ""now"" and the ""then,"" when she was 6 and 8), is a good, solid story that mainly explores what it means - for Hallie, for her older sister Marthe, for hired-man and veteran Heron, for Hallie's neighbors and friends Tyler, Nat, Ada, and for Hallie's brother-in-law, Thom, lost during the war - to be heroes in various circumstances in life and death. I really liked how this theme unwound - the author painted the scenes, atmosphere, characters, Twisted Things, all with patience, depth and experiences anyone can relate to at some point. Although the war is part of the story, I wouldn't say it's even the biggest piece of it - it's more about family (the good, the bad and the ugly) and friends. It's about enemies and some secrets they carry that can reach even an opponent's heart. It's about belief and betrayal, misunderstandings, and the consequences. It's also about the pains and joys of growing up, the ties that bind, what it means to stay and fight or make amends instead of walk away and sulk. The easy connection between Tyler and Hallie made me smile at times - their ""spite or pride"" question was a pretty good one that I might ask myself in the future.I would suggest taking your time and committing yourself to this book, because the payoffs for reading it aren't in just one place. I didn't think the story or the action was slow at all, but some might get impatient with the time spent getting to know the characters and their stories - the author doesn't skimp on delving into who people are (and their histories). Something is always happening, but I recognize that what I find interesting or exciting may not work for others - I was a bit enthralled just with meeting Ada in her ""laboratory"" with the Twisted Things contained in glass jars. There are definitely *big* action /fight /revelation /WHAT?! scenes that occur in the last half of the book, so if you can just keep reading, you should find something to spark your interest before the story ends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NCOL458KG78J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054428111X#wasThisHelpful","R1NCOL458KG78J","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I liked most about ""Inuyashiki 1"" was how well emotions were portrayed. It's amazing to see the depth and details in this story unfold. That, combined with carefully, almost lovingly created art, expresses with finesse what's happening. Words like ""contempt"" (seems to be what Inuyashiki's family feels for him; I hope that's not true deep down, but he's definitely not appreciated), ""soul-searching,"" ""defeated and lonely,"" ""complete bafflement,"" ""hope and affection"" (I love the selfless action and the wonderful canine companion) come to mind as just a few of the emotions that are not just seen - they're felt.

"""Girl Waits with Gun"" is one of those rare books that isn't just good or great; it was a completely engaging adventure that I hated had to end. With many books, I expect there to be some part that is a bit dry or dull or the story loses its shine or appeal briefly - I may like or enjoy the book overall, but have to fight off the temptation to skim the parts where I find my mind wandering. There were no such dull, or even ordinary, parts to this book - even a so-called tedious day in the lives of the Misses Kopp sprang to intriguing life on the pages. The 1914 atmosphere drew me in and the voices and personalities of Constance, Norma, Fleurette and their family members living and dead, Sheriff Heath and his men, and seemingly untouchable silk dyer/villain Henry Kaufmann, his henchmen and their mission to cause as much fear, destruction and loss to people as possible, all captivated me and kept me involved in the story without interruption.I found the story itself - of a rich and drunk man intent on harm simply because he can get away with it - and how one woman in her mid-30s who's happy to be unmarried at a time when women are expected to be dependent and docile, stands up for herself and vows to fight back with her brains as well as her brawn, to be compelling. But there's much more to the story that enhances and enriches the reading experience, and I enjoyed every moment of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SABKEQN6OBM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409914#wasThisHelpful","R2SABKEQN6OBM0","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If readers want more of a performance or theatrical review, this biography of Maggie Smith's is very thorough in covering Maggie's work. In fact, the book is mostly about Maggie's acting career: Details and more details about the play or movie or other professional work, including other actors and their comments, and delving into particular scenes and how they are acted. I found it to be quite dull - the author expresses that Maggie has a personality, but it isn't brought to life here, though there were glimpses (Maggie's early relationship with her mother and a general picture of her childhood is presented in a more personal, sympathetic way, and I loved learning what books Maggie read and enjoyed as a child, and the fact that she sat in the bathtub with her blue jeans on).The book felt more like a technical study of Maggie's professional world and works, and less like a personal portrait of Maggie as a whole person - it lacked warmth and personality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DP6D1ATION90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250081483#wasThisHelpful","R3DP6D1ATION90","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Wolf by Wolf"" offers a little something for anyone who loves a fresh, imaginative piece of art that doesn't skimp on delving into the thoughts and emotions of a girl who used to be a victim but who now strives to be a heroine who effects change in the world.The book is split between ""now"" (1956 Germania and other locales the young motorcycle racers happen to be) and ""then"" (1944, when Yael is 6 and is the victim of Nazi experimentation). The shifts between the two time frames is well done - there is no confusion or difficulty in understanding which time frame you're in (or why) - the ""now"" is devoted to the race; the ""then"" is devoted to giving the reader an idea of what Yael has been through that has brought her to the point and mission of the race - the identities of the wolves that are inked on Yael's arm are also explored in the ""then"" time frame and how each inspired or interacted with Yael.There's a lot to this book, but I don't want to ruin any of the surprises - and there are quite a few twists and turns and the unexpected. Experiencing those surprises for yourself is half the fun, so I will just touch on a few of my favorite concepts that are explored and be done - compassion (who proves to show it is one of those pleasant surprises) despite the abundance of cruelty, competition and a sometimes brutal struggle just to survive) and perseverance. (When you're filled with words of criticism from someone you loved, you're still carrying a load of self-doubt and it seems obvious you're beaten, how do you keep going?)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1J6O0BF7R3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316405124#wasThisHelpful","R2M1J6O0BF7R3E","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Jade Dragon Mountain"" was enjoyable from the beginning through to the end. There were no dull, sleep-inducing portions where I was tempted to skim quickly; this was a story to take my time with and savor it slowly.Li Du proved to be a thoughtful character who wasn't overly confident or flashy, yet had a quiet, consistent intelligence he didn't always show everyone. Li Du also had a good imagination and patience to ferret out the clues he needed to solve not only the mystery of who killed the Jesuit astronomer Brother Pieter (whom he has met, had a lively conversation with and might have become good friends with had he not been murdered) and why, but other smaller mysteries within the story. Li Du is clever and knowledgeable but humble, kind, able to listen, and interestingly enough, bold when he needs to be. Getting to know Li Du and his story, along with the people he meets through the story, is satisfying and told with just the right degree of suspense and well-planned timing. Other positives include learning a bit about Chinese politics and culture. The location of Dayan is expressed with flair, grace and a vivid style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CR04X9IVKVSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072328#wasThisHelpful","R1CR04X9IVKVSZ","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's difficult for me, as a teacher, to try and stay healthy when I'm surrounded by so many children who are sick and swapping their colds and flus with anyone close to them. I like these Purell sanitizing wipes because they don't seem as harsh as the brand I usually use - my hands aren't nearly as dry or cracked after using them. I also like the fact that the scent is very mild - I've cleaned desks before students arrive to class, and many children complain about the strong odor when I use another brand of wipes. So far, none have noticed the Purell wipes' smell.While these wipes are strong, easy to use and quite nice for quick, regular use in small jobs - wiping crumbs off desks after snacks - they don't seem as good to use for the big jobs.

"""Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America"" has a special kind of power because although it does have plenty of statistics and news reports through history; results of research and studies; and day-by-day logs of who was murdered that resemble the long lists of who begat who in the Bible; the book also gives an in-depth and personal look at the hearts, minds and lives of people on both sides of the violence. The life of murdered black teen Bryant Tennelle, the gentle son of a successful homicide detective, is presented with care and compassion so that he becomes more than a statistic: he becomes a living, breathing, valuable human being. Detective John Skaggs, devoted and exceptional at his job, but not without his flaws, is white and constantly proving - through actions rather than words - to grieving black families that no, it's not ""just another black man"" to him, and yes, he cares about justice for these murdered men. Skaggs' goal is to make black lives expensive, not so cheap they're barely noticed.The reader also spends a good deal of time with Bryant's father, Wally Tennelle, and the rest of Wally's family, as they work, play, and finally deal with the horror and tragedy of Bryant's murder. Several police officers have a voice as they explain their workloads and what it's like to work the streets where murder is a daily event. Witnesses add more pieces to the story - their fears, failings, as well as the story of one special female witness who helps Detective Skaggs move forward with an important stalled case. Everyone involved with either fighting crime or seeking justice tells pieces of a story that tries to understand, explain and explore possible solutions to the long-existing problem of blacks killing other blacks. This book is interesting, engaging and enlightening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZQKQKAFZATLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385529988#wasThisHelpful","R2ZQKQKAFZATLO","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried at first to read several letters' worth of lessons (thoughts? ideas? a plan for a daily devotion? - each letter includes some of each). But this really didn't work for me, because each letter demands more time and thought than a quick read-through. I found I would miss too much if I read more than 2 letters at a time, so that is what I settled in for. Lisa Nichols Hickman introduces each letter with a pair of words (but often, more ideas for words are included within the short, 5-6 page chapters), and shares a personal story of why these words mean something to her, how it impacted her Christian life (and her thoughts, and her prayers) and what she's learned. There is a lot of imagery, a lot of repetition (which normally I wouldn't care for - here, though, it felt like meditation, which was important to building a better memory of the key points) and quite a bit of encouragement - to think, consider, find some way to action. One of my favorites was imagination/icicles, because I could relate (several of them are relatable, but some make you smile more than others) and also because I've never considered prayer concerning imagination. I also enjoyed the quotes at the beginning of each chapter/letter ... the one for imagination/icicles was ""Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere."" - Albert Einstein.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJT9L357KW87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426767536#wasThisHelpful","R3OJT9L357KW87","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Migratory Animals"" had several ideas and characters I found interesting and thought-provoking, but there were also long explanatory passages (to explain science or how art was made) which I understood needed to be included in some form, but they were so dull, rambling and long-winded that I lost my involvement in the story at times and found my mind wandering.Flannery has been away in Nigeria, where she's fallen in love and made a home. So when out of monetary and scientific necessity she finds herself back in Texas, a good part of her mind and heart stay behind in Nigeria. Flan's most important goal is getting back to Nigeria as quickly as possible - even when she discovers her little sister, Molly, has Huntington's Disease, which her mother had - and died an awful death from - years before.Flan is in a quandary - when is it OK to live her own life - or is it never OK because family connections (and responsibilities) don't really end (or shouldn't ... should they)? She wrestles with guilt, dread, fear, love for her sister and friends, and a drive to do the most effective work to most help those she's left behind in Nigeria.Meanwhile, Molly struggles with past family secrets as well as the need to face her diagnosis. Then she discovers she's got a secret of her own, and finds a helping hand in Alyce, Flannery's best friend who carries a heavy burden of depression and is struggling just to survive day to day.The chapters - and story - are told from different characters' points of view. Their stories merge into one big tapestry, which is somewhat beautiful but also has some flaws and unfinished parts.

It's also about the funny, victorious, hopeful and compassionate moments. I was completely taken in by the relationship between Lev and his older sister, Lina - the clever way the two teased one another and ""got even"" for tricks played was full of humor and good cheer. On the other hand, I was just as riveted by Lev's family's terrifying ordeal at the border when they were trying to exit the USSR (vicious people were in control of whether his family would be locked up instead of permitted to leave the country).The people Lev and his family meet are just as compelling as Lev and his family. The reader meets various people from charitable organizations who are committed and make a huge difference in the lives of these Jewish refugees. The way Lev introduces them and tells their stories (with warmth and affection) sparks the reader to feel deeply and appreciate these people as if we knew them ourselves. From Binder, who gladly opens up his hotel to help house and feed the refugees on their journey, to Eva, who gives away free clothing - there's a clear, unhurried picture of each person or group of people who helped along the way and their stories/kindnesses.There is the big picture in this memoir, but also little details (Lev learning the alphabet; Lina getting a job; Lev's dad working for free just to get a good recommendation to take to the U.S. with them) and everyday life that brings Lev, his family, people who threaten and cause problems as well as those who care and help, to vivid life. You can't help but read on; the story pulls you in and you find you'd rather stay in it than put the book down to do other things you must do (like work).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JS3M63YJS8WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537778#wasThisHelpful","R1JS3M63YJS8WQ","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just to look at it, other than a simple design, this Charmin Basic doesn't look like much. While it does look like there's more paper on the roll, it isn't as thick, being single-ply, as the Charmin Ultra (soft or strong varieties). I was not impressed and didn't expect much. I thought I'd have to use twice as much.I was glad to be surprised, then. Despite it looking flimsy or thin, this Charmin is as strong and absorbent - without losing its softness and without having to use more - as other kinds I've tried. I was satisfied - despite being more expensive than some, it will last longer, which makes it more competitive with less expensive brands that have smaller rolls and less quality.If you like Charmin but want to save a little money, this is worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VZF1OE9QPN7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3EA4P8#wasThisHelpful","R3VZF1OE9QPN7I","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this book. But I had to force myself to finish it, and even after a solid ending that gives closure, I am not satisfied or happy to have read it.It's not about liking or disliking the characters - it's more that they all lacked color (or spark?). It's not about a dull or snail-paced plot, either (Leila and the people she meets along the way all move rather quickly and don't sit still on the pages).The main problem was I struggled to find any connection to or emotion for any of the characters. None of them felt genuine enough, were interesting enough, or maybe they lacked depth. Most of their behavior, conversations, actions and problems seemed either too typical (including stereotypical) of what others have done (I did actively search for originality; there were a few glimmers here and there but not enough) or a bit dumb (as in ridiculous, over the top, difficult to believe - and not enjoyable to read). I could understand the reason for Leila's journey and had a mild interest in her reaching her goals, but while I tried, I couldn't feel much for any of the characters. While I found a few pages here and there where there was an interesting concept, idea or something happened that made me feel something other than boredom, overall I didn't get much of value from this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FOAW31OYBI3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211244#wasThisHelpful","R2FOAW31OYBI3W","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was engaged and interested in the beginning of ""Take Me With You."" The conversations felt natural and genuine; I believed what the characters said and their behavior began to express their personalities. But then I began to lose interest and the story lost a lot of its magic. I liked Seth, the 12-year-old, but once August begins his summer excursion with him and his little brother, Henry, Seth's conversation sometimes becomes unnatural (it didn't sound like a 12-year-old speaking) and repetitive. When Seth kept saying certain emotional things over and over again it seemed like the words' only purpose was to evoke pity or sympathy - they didn't add anything to the story nor move the plot forward. The children and their situation naturally demand readers' concern and sympathy - I can't comprehend how anyone with a heart wouldn't feel deeply for these children (and August), so the repetition only succeeded in distracting and distancing me from the story.I know it's petty, but the overuse of the sigh (the title should be, ""Take Me With You, and Sigh Every Step of the Way"") made me a little crazy, also. Is there truly no other way to describe a character's reaction to a frustrating or difficult situation?Despite being annoyed, I did stick with this book and read all of it. I admit to being a fan of Henry, the younger brother, who at 7 would go long periods of time without speaking at all. It was very satisfying when he takes a stand and speaks up for himself. I also understood the value of several other issues (how do you know when you're an alcoholic? how do you make a difference in a child's life when you're not a blood relative and the adult doesn't want you around? how do you stage an intervention, and what do you do if it doesn't work?) that were discussed rather well: I particularly liked what was said in one of the AA meetings, about if one goes around with a pillow trying to break others' falls, it might not be the great thing one thinks it is. Issues are handled with compassion and a strong dose of reality: It was nice to see how someone might deal with a problem that persists.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W3NZENU67MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477820019#wasThisHelpful","R7W3NZENU67MR","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jacob Underwood has been transformed because of a motorcycle accident. He cannot identify, understand or experience human feelings and believes he is dead (he has Cotard’s Syndrome).Other than the crazy and different - yet disturbingly believable - world Jacob exists within, Jacob himself is fascinating. He tells his story, including his current job as an enforcer, and his history - and what has happened to make him the way he is. Despite Jacob's lack of ability to experience or understand emotions, he has a compelling and mystifyingly magnetic personality. He often uses colors to describe things (from smells, to pain, to the physical nearness of someone). He has style, intelligence and pizzazz - his thoughts, methods, odd habits (he can't stand to eat or drink any food and consumes a nutrient drink only because he has to), rules to survive (tell people he doesn't like to be touched; he must wash his Shell every day), surprising reaction to dogs - all of these pieces of Jacob make him appealing. From beginning of the story to the end, his Spark shines with a curious, inviting brightness.I enjoyed the overall story of Jacob: his job, the mystery of the missing target he’s assigned to track and some confusing events he encounters which are related to his job, as well as the advanced technology of his world, the politics and society he’s moving through. But the best part of the book was getting to know Jacob and watching his Spark catch fire, and hoping that despite the odds, he’d manage to survive long enough to solve some personal and professional problems and be better for it despite his insistence that the words “good, evil, right and wrong” have no meaning and are irrelevant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22V54R6YILV4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538677#wasThisHelpful","R22V54R6YILV4Y","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands"" deserves an extra star for the moment when 16-year-old Emily lets the reader in on a little secret: Most Emily Dickinson poems can be read (or sung, rather) to the theme song of Gilligan's Island. I couldn't help but try it (and it's true)! Emily (who calls herself Abby for awhile) is a wonderfully intense little firecracker and her personality really sparks the story along - some parts, like setting the poems to music, were fun, unique and made me smile. Other parts of Emily's story - such as how she went to school drunk one day, getting into trouble to send a message to her often-drunk parents what it was like to live with people who drank too much and got into embarrassing situations - show Emily's sass, determination and strength.I loved this book for the way it shines a light on human nature and how some people still manage to find ways to survive despite major catastrophes, people's hatred, abuse and fear, and to find reasons to live and care about others. A terrible tragedy has occurred and her parents are being blamed - and Emily finds herself alone and on the run. She meets a wide variety of people along the way - some friendly, some scary, some bullies, some who need help, and one who behaves cruelly in the beginning but who grows up a bit, changes, and offers Emily inspiration instead of reasons to fear and dread.I could identify with Emily's guilt and criticism of herself - she feels she's disappointed everyone and made too many stupid mistakes and poor choices. But her courage in the face of everything falling apart around her really is uplifting. Emily is genuine, has depth and doesn't behave predictably or even rationally at times - her story, retold in journal-style, is somewhat messy (which makes sense, considering what she goes through) and not well organized (and it's not supposed to be). It all somehow works and adds an element of reality to the story. When Emily explains the history of the phrase ""Close your eyes, hold hands,"" it opens yet another avenue of thought for the reader while tying an extra meaning to Emily's story.I very much liked the thoughtfulness of the story, which was somewhat disguised and hidden like pirate's treasure within a ""quasi-Looney Tune"" teenage girl's disorganized, somewhat messy and sometimes highly emotional (understandably - it never feels over the top, though) retelling of her story of survival.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21KO99OIGJEF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385534833#wasThisHelpful","R21KO99OIGJEF2","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the kind of book that has the capacity to do for its readers what it's done for its characters: Inspire hope to overcome and to change your situation; unleash the potential to be kind to a complete stranger; spark action to connect with others and help improve others' lives if at all possible.At times Ellen's story felt a bit over-the-top (Temerity, while I really do love her spunky, can-do attitude, is a bit too perfect even though she does need to ask for help ""seeing"" certain things). Plenty is going on - gang and drug activity, a few murderers and thieves on the loose, a few situations with babies and their uncertain futures, invisible Ellen's brand-new friendship with Temerity - and Ellen's horrific childhood flashbacks where she somehow survived unimaginable abuse. It's not that I don't like all the action, but there's so much going on that a woman accustomed to being social would struggle; Ellen, who's been invisible all her life, is all of a sudden taking on some major problems with just a few squawks here and there. Temerity plays a major role in supporting Ellen and encouraging her to live courageously, but it happens too quickly for me to find it very believable.My favorite part of ""Invisible Ellen"" was seeing Ellen's intelligence blossom as she snuck around and made things happen behind the scenes - without being seen by anyone. I also enjoyed Temerity's boldness in helping others (because when you think of others, you tend to forget to think so much about your own problems) - her conversation with Janelle when she was ""shopping for a rug"" and seeking a disabled discount was clever, witty and brought out the personalities of both women.Overall, the book is well worth reading: I've felt invisible many times before and wanted to be invisible in many situations, too - as I'm sure many people have - so, many people will relate to Ellen and want to see her succeed. Also, Ellen's story is a reminder that if things are bad in your life, they can get better. Who knows who's out there who might speak or act kindly toward you and inspire you to pass that kindness on? Who knows whose lives you might touch or maybe change for the better? Who knows how many friends are waiting for you to find them and how your life could be made richer for brainstorming with these new friends ways to help others? The possibilities are endless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYLREU5VTG3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167617#wasThisHelpful","R1VYLREU5VTG3T","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Book of Unknown Americans"" does an exceptional job of speaking to the heart of its readers. The personal, honest and engaging voices the characters use to describe their thoughts, beliefs, things they've seen or experienced - and the language used to paint a scene the reader is able to step into and watch  (sometimes with breath held) what happens next, caught my attention early in the book and kept me captivated. Many scenes described were everyday scenes some Americans may take for granted because they're so ordinary. But to a family that's never been to America, knows no one, and has hurried to the U.S. due to a life-or-death emergency and has had no time to learn English - the act of buying groceries can be a scary if not traumatic experience. These scenes made me think what I might do if I were in their shoes. If I HAD to go to a foreign country to save a loved one, would I go? How would I feel if people who lived in that country were rude, impatient, or outright hostile for no reason I could see?The vibrant characters behave in ways I could understand: They had heart, spirit, hope - and a link to who I am and what I want in life, too. The unknown Americans are shown to be people with goals common to my own who are deserving of being known, of being shown respect, compassion and common courtesy.I will remember this thought-provoking, meaningful story about a family that comes to the U.S. for help, hope and healing - and the people the family members meet during their stay in Delaware - for a long time. The many voices telling their stories added a satisfying dimension which gave me a glimpse into various lives and experiences and left echoes in my mind even after they'd finished speaking and someone else had begun to speak.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVFZ5LI5RCBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350848#wasThisHelpful","RPVFZ5LI5RCBD","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spunky P.I. Fina Ludlow makes a shining second appearance (after Loyalty) in a mystery about cryobanks and the families they help create. Identity refers to not only a single mom's quest to discover the identity of her daughter's father, but also to Fina's quest to find the identity of a murderer (who killed a sperm donor, and why?), and Fina's mission to help friend Risa discover the identity of the woman who claims to be her aunt. There is also thought given to what makes up a person's identity - family? friends? illness? wealth?One of the things I liked about ""Identity"" is the abundance of action on more than one level (there's more than one case Fina tackles, but there aren't so many the reader is confused about what's happening). There's action regarding Fina helping her family, her friends, and clients she doesn't particularly like. There's also action and progress made for Fina personally - she has to face and deal with her older brother, Rand, (Rand has committed a horrendous crime against his daughter, Haley, and Fina discovers this crime and does everything in her power to protect Haley - all of which is explained in the first book, ""Loyalty,"") and his threat to make a triumphant return to the family business. Fina also has to define her feelings when cop Cristian becomes involved with a woman who could prove to be someone special. Massage therapist Milloy is present in this second adventure, and I love the guy but wanted a bit more depth or connection between him and Fina: I missed hearing a bit more of his wit and his thoughts. He's present, yet muted (Cristian, however, does have a good voice in ""Identity"").The mystery. the characters, the pieces of story - were all interesting and well presented at a good pace. Fina's magnetically drawn on the page and she lights up every avenue of the story with her spark and zippy personality. (Maybe not zippy. What's the right word? She's fun, loves a good verbal sparring; yet she's thoughtful and caring, as well). I'm addicted to Fina's cases and know I'll be back for any future adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y2QN097L0HPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162135#wasThisHelpful","R2Y2QN097L0HPA","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is very little in this carefully crafted, suspenseful mystery that doesn't have a surprise attached to it. Alex is complex. Just when you think she is one thing (for example, a victim), you discover she is also something else (can't give it away!) ... I suspected there was even more to Alex and there were reasons for certain things she's doing, but as the layers of her life and personality are peeled back, what I learn is never exactly what I expect (I was able to guess a few little pieces because Camille, the police commandant leading the investigation, and his team gave me hints and clues).The personalities, even of the most unlikable characters imaginable, are riveting - in horror films there are sometimes moments when the squeamish (me) want to hide eyes and/or look away - but in this novel there is none of that. There is just no unsticking those eyes that are glued to the pages. I couldn't help but read on and on, sometimes a bit impatiently, but always being rewarded all the way. The action is nonstop; I was impressed that the characters were as lively and believable as they were considering how much was going on. But the pacing is precise and the explanations are very thorough and clear - the writing is tight and electric and I was much too involved - and jolted - to get lost.

"This book is a collectible work of art; I really enjoyed it as it's not just a half-hearted or hurried story or even stories of the people within its pages. ""Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932"" is full of life, love, heart and questions: When and how are heroes and villains created?This is not an easy read, but by that I don't mean it's confusing or dull. It's multi-layered, and has a depth that I liked wandering around in, and that I found interesting, but it demands the reader's attention and time. Also, there are multiple stories and points of view. All stories relate in some way to Lou Villars, whose story is being told from all angles - through a photographer's lens (and his life), through a writer and teacher's words and through several people whose lives intersected with Lou's. We see who Lou was, as a child and through her life, and any golden nuggets of good as well as the destruction she had a hand in, during the time of Hitler's rise to power. The decision is left with the reader as to who Lou really was - if she was human and had some scrap of love or kindness in her or only a monster without heart or soul - and if she should be shown compassion or only contempt.What I liked most was getting to see different sides to one story, and the use of art to paint one perspective. What one person sees or experiences may not be how another person in the same place at the same time sees or experiences something. Sometimes, two different people tell similar or complementary stories, one filling in the gaps left by another. The ending is intriguing because what one chronicler of Lou's story writes is called into question by another person in a way that leaves some questions but still manages to end the story gracefully and satisfactorily. I actually kind of liked having some intrigue at the end because it lets the reader continue to think, question and decide for him- or herself what to believe about Lou, her story and the rest of the cast of people who lived during that difficult time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27EJZ6EYTKVYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061713783#wasThisHelpful","R27EJZ6EYTKVYQ","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Within the first few chapters, I was drawn into this story - the language and style of writing, the characters, the plot. I thought, ""This resonates; I am really going to love this.""But as the story progressed, while I liked it, I didn't love it throughout the rest of the book as much as I did at the very beginning. The ending has some of the magic the beginning offered, and I remembered what had initially drawn me into the story. But I didn't feel the magic, the total immersion, throughout the entire story. There were times I didn't want to keep reading; I was bored, annoyed, or just disappointed by anything from too much silliness which took away from some of the beauty of the story, or characters who ended up being shallow, or shells of the people who, I thought at first meeting them, had depth and unique style. At times I felt as deceived as Irene (who was made for George) says she is.The story is good - sweet even - and the characters are quirky and likable. It's a love story on more than one level - it's not all fairy tale, either, as some hearts connect and others don't: Not everyone gets a happy ending, and that was fine. But the deeper meanings and lovely, lyrical thoughts and insights are limited (the dreaming and the connections the characters shared there was the best and most fascinating part of the whole story). And that's what bugged me most.

"I was a little worried about trying these Tide pods because I have a front-end washing machine and I have some delicate blouses that need to be washed on the hand-wash cycle - I was afraid the pods might stain or even ruin my delicates. So, I tried the pods first on a hot-water load of towels. No problems at all, and I liked the cleaner, brighter and fresher smelling clothes, so I held my breath and tried the pods with every load of laundry, including the delicates. I was relieved, and very happy, when I had no problems at all. Hot water or cold, heavy-duty washing or shortened cycle hand-wash, the Tide pods did a great job on them all.This package is perfect because it's complete and takes care of every stage of the laundry. I also loved the Downy chips and found that it's fun to experiment with how many pieces to use. With my delicates, I only used a few. With my sheets, I used enough to cover the bottom of the lid you pour the chips into, and it was enough to noticeably improve the laundry's scent without being overpowering. I really like the whole bundle - the Bounce dryer sheets make a pleasant ending to the whole laundry chore, which feels more satisfying to complete knowing you're using high-quality products which really work to make your clothes cleaner and fresher..","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0UZOB680K6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8MYRJI#wasThisHelpful","R1R0UZOB680K6K","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up ""Gutenberg's Apprentice"" because as a booklover, and having watched countless times in amazement as a modern press pumps out daily newspapers, I am fascinated with the printing process and how books and other printed materials are created. Although bits and pieces of this story - which chronicles the first press and the many trials and challenges faced - are indeed interesting - occasionally fantastic (and somewhat mind-boggling), overall, the story lacks depth in its relationships and personalities of the characters.It's not that I didn't like the characters (the master, Gutenberg: the inventor of the press and whose ideas gave spark to future undertakings; his apprentice, Peter, whose adopted father, Fust, is financing the press; and the growing team of people who poured themselves into the press's first major work: those who drew, carved and made the letters, mixed the ink, managed the press, hung the paper to dry, etc.) Not liking the characters is not it at all. I just felt disconnected too much of the time, and wanted to see a bit more depth to their personalities. Sometimes the writing is so formal (technical? history-bookish?) that it moves the characters off to a distance, and chills the fiery personalities we get glimpses of, but not much more. There is the occasional look into a character's life, usually Peter's, which offered that rare glimpse of emotion and personality. But apart from a lot of bickering, there are only a few tender moments or positive connections.The book tries to detail too many historical occurrences at the time of the press's first major work. The politics, religion (and superstitions), financial hardships - and the occasional 35-year jump-ahead where Peter related the story to an abbot who is writing down his story - all feel relevant and integral to the story, but none of these influencing factors felt relayed in a satisfying way. Some were focused on too intently (and in quite a dry manner); others were not delved into deeply enough. None made the characters more personal or life-like.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10H8VMQCCEZSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062336010#wasThisHelpful","R10H8VMQCCEZSW","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story unfolds at a perfect pace, exploring how Laurel gradually comes to face, and then find a way to live with, losing her big sister, May, who she admired and wanted to be like. Laurel tackles many other challenges that come her way. Just a few include: starting high school where she doesn't know anyone; writing letters to famous dead people for an English assignment; learning who she wants to be and how to begin growing into that person; and discovering that NOT talking about things is hurting her, not helping her - but how can she talk about what happened the night May died, and who can she trust?Some of the things I loved about the book are its vivid imagery, lyrical language and pieces of poems and good, sometimes magical memories Laurel shares from her childhood that express a depth to Laurel's feelings and experiences. Laurel - and the dead people she writes to (and her boyfriend, parents and friends) - really come alive and shine; you can really get a clear picture of how they think and feel. I also felt the revealing of Laurel's secret (part of what happens - and why it happened - the night May dies) was not only well expressed, but it unfolds at a perfect pace - the reader sees a glimpse here, a hint there, and then we can see the whole picture. Sky, Laurel's boyfriend, has his own interesting story to tell and the connection between Laurel and Sky deepens as more of his story is revealed. It's captivating to see how Sky and his story twines with Laurel, her story, struggle and personality.The story is just plain good for the heart and soul. It has the potential to touch people's hearts, whether they're happy or sad, and to offer thought-provoking ideas for dealing with life's challenges which we all must face at some point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BQJC8RDNIMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374346674#wasThisHelpful","R37BQJC8RDNIMY","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I picked up ""The Life List,"" I expected a fun, pleasant read, but I didn't expect to feel quite so much. I thought it might be a little lighter than it was: Not that Brett's story is bleak or depressing, exactly, but what she goes through after her mom dies is very realistic and genuinely felt and expressed. I did laugh - there were a lot of funny parts that felt natural, not forced - but I was shocked when I found myself moved to tears by Brett's thoughts, feelings or experiences, because they were so easy for me to understand and relate to. I could think of times in my life, even if I didn't experience exactly what Brett did, that I felt similar things - good, bad, or a struggle. I also admired how as Brett is trying to accomplish things from her life list she wrote as a 14-year-old that some of the results were NOT what I expected. It was refreshing to find so many surprises, (both of success and failure), and so many reasons to keep reading (speedily, almost breathlessly) on.This book isn't a work of fluff or superficiality - it follows through with its goals; it's emotionally compelling; and it's satisfying - in plot, problems and resolutions. I had a very tough time putting this book down - I wanted to know what happened next. I also loved Brett as well as many of the characters (even though Brett's mom has died, she comes alive in Brett's memories and in the notes she leaves behind, so the reader really gets to know her, too). I felt like they were people I wished I could know. I'm glad I read it and enjoyed being on Brett's journey to realizing what she wants and all that she can give, and do, in life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYSPO8OOAADX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540875#wasThisHelpful","R2KYSPO8OOAADX","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually enjoy fractured or twisted fairy tales or turning a story upside down. And some of the ideas in ""Dorothy Must Die"" could have been crafted into a fantastic tale. Amy herself isn't an unlikable character, nor are the winged monkeys or the Wicked Witches (though there are a bit too many platitudes and a generally preachy feel that didn't feel genuine). But to take wholesome, good-hearted characters from such a popular, well-loved story and turn them so completely evil with no good reason or explanation made the ""villains"" flat, one-dimensional, and more than just unlikable. We have Dorothy, the scarecrow, the tin woodman and the lion all suddenly violent, hateful, and power-hungry to the point of ruthlessly and recklessly killing for no reason at all. Dorothy is a petty and annoying whiner who only eats muffin tops, complains over bacon fixed incorrectly, and wants to off the wizard for not giving the tin woodman better relationship advice ... these villains don't just grate on the nerves; they're just plain unbelievable. So very sad; if their story, their abrupt turnabout had been explained with any effort at all, and if these evil characters had been given even a tiny bit of personality or even a glimpse of their familiar good peeking out at odd times, they would have been enigmatic, fabulous villains who would help give Amy and her wicked team more depth, more of a story to roam around in, instead of limiting them to this ridiculous version of Oz that I hated.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NNB2M99QNDSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062280678#wasThisHelpful","R3NNB2M99QNDSV","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Garden of Burning Sand"" has appealing main and supporting characters: Zoe Fleming, who is an American human rights lawyer working in Africa, a strong, likable team working for the prosecution (from Joseph - a local police officer with tragedy and violence in his past, and a personal illness he must decide to face - to Sarge, who prosecutes in court), a hardworking and sympathetic local doctor and kindly, supportive nuns who look after orphan children in Zambia. Zoe and the prosecution doggedly pursue justice for a teenage girl named Kuyeya with Down syndrome who has been raped.What I most liked in the beginning was hearing Kuyeya's voice (her thoughts) - this was very effective at drawing me in and capturing my interest. If she had been given more of a voice throughout the story, Kuyeya would have been a much stronger character. (The reader comes to affectionately expect the balloon noise she makes, and can appreciate her love for Johnny Cash but this reader wanted to see more of her personality and spirit; Kuyeya offers something vital to the story and her case much later in the story, but it loses a bit of its impact since we no longer hear any of her thoughts or glean any kind of insight into her feelings other than a general feeling of pain and distress.) I sometimes felt that Kuyeya herself is pushed into the background of the story.The mystery of who raped Kuyeya and the development of the villains were well crafted and easy to follow and understand. Zoe's past is well illuminated, as well as her blossoming relationships with several other characters. I cared about and was hoping for more funding and more progress to be made more quickly for both the AIDS and rape victims. My main struggle with this book was while I liked it, I didn't find myself as involved as I had hoped to be. I wanted to like it more, but was a bit frustrated with the countless issues being brought up, left to dangle (not just for a chapter or two, but long lapses) while other issues are introduced while we then return to some problem or danger the prosecution team faces. It felt like too many issues to fully explore (most were touched on superficially), and so I felt little satisfaction from knowing about most of them, even though many are resolved in some way by the end. There were many reasons to celebrate in the story, and much hope and many positive messages tucked within the book. I enjoyed the book but it isn't something that will stand out in my memory.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1G0R1EXTDJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623651298#wasThisHelpful","RU1G0R1EXTDJN","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What makes ""Shotgun Lovesongs"" so special is the story's emotional impact and its ability to fully engage the reader in the lives of this group of friends. Beth, married to Henry; musician Lee; bull-rider and slightly altered (from a nasty bump on the head while drunk) but still capable Ronny; and seemingly selfish though deep-down really good guy Kip all take a turn telling their stories and how their lives connect with and are changed by their childhood friends. The story has such depth, vivid and genuine personality, open-heartedness and raw honesty to it that it was difficult NOT to like any of the characters. The book is written with a majestic, beautiful and at times haunting language that lingers in your memory and flows so smoothly you cease to realize exactly how quickly the book is slipping away; you're so involved in the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2SHSEXVTJ45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250039819#wasThisHelpful","R2E2SHSEXVTJ45","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""All Our Names"" is a deeply felt and thoughtful story about two young men from poor African villages who meet at a university and become like brothers. Bird, so named by his father, but who ends up with several names (Professor, Langston, Dickens and Daniel) says at the very beginning of the story that he's given up the names his parents had given him. Nameless for awhile, the 25-year-old seems to fall under the spell of a strong-spirited, charismatic Isaac, who has fresh ideas for change and a quick fight in the revolution. But when the tension and violence ratchets up several notches, both boys change. Isaac decides to stay in Africa despite the increasing violence and lack of safe places, and he makes plans for his friend to travel to America.Using his friend's name, Bird arrives safely in America, and meets and begins a relationship with Helen, a social worker. The story is told, in alternating chapters, from the point of view of Helen, and from Bird's perspective (but these chapters are entitled ""Isaac"" even though they're told in Bird's voice - and although it seems confusing, it's not because these chapters are mostly about Isaac and the brotherhood the two men share, and it illuminates Bird's deep appreciation - and perhaps regret at the consequences - for his friend Isaac's gift of the use of his name and a fresh start in America).The story flows easily between the war-torn lives of Isaac and Bird, and Bird's struggling new life living under Isaac's name in America. The images of attacks on villages, refugees seeking safe haven, boys toting guns and engaging soldiers in battle, and beatings both Isaac and Bird endure, are all very vivid and stir a storm of emotion in the reader. Helen's character felt more distant and vague; I didn't dislike her but I didn't feel much of a connection or an understanding of her. She and her relationship with Bird feel more like background to the *real* story of Isaac and Bird - maybe this is intentional and demonstrates Bird's reluctance to allow himself to let go and more fully enjoy his life because he feels his friend Isaac should have been able to enjoy a happier, freer life as well but was denied that.""All Our Names"" ultimately explores not just friendship or brotherhood and what those ideas mean in the middle of war, but it brings to life hope, freedom and the idea that a life should be lived fully and joyfully because it's the best way to honor a brother's sacrifice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URS9YHBEC852/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038534998X#wasThisHelpful","R2URS9YHBEC852","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yulia, 17, finds herself captured and forced to work for the KGB, along with a handful of other teenagers, all with various gifts (Larissa sees countless possible futures; Masha can remotely view a scene and is working on moving objects with her mind; Valya can change or even erase a person's memories). When Yulia touches someone or something, she can hear that person's thoughts (or with things, she can identify whose things they are). But Yulia 's special abilities aren't so well defined, and she discovers there is much more to learn about herself and what powers she may be able to draw on to defend herself and those she loves.Yulia doesn't want to work for the KGB, but Rostov, the one in charge and controlling things (and people) regardless of what each might want, has captured Yulia's mother, who has been forced to continue her genetic research, and her brother, who needs special care. And Yulia's father disappeared a long time ago. How can she hope to escape the KGB and keep her family safe?The characters and their relationships are well developed and dance to their chosen music throughout the book. Music is part of the tools they use to protect themselves. Who is friend and who is foe is not always clear, and when Yulia discovers part of her past has been scrubbed, she's on a mission of her own to find lost memories and the reason why she was ""wiped,"" Meanwhile, she completes several missions with the other teens for Rostov, all working toward a master plan of eliminating Rostov's opponents and putting Russia on the fast track toward war with the U.S.Sekret grabs your attention and doesn't let go: Just when you think you have some clue as to what's going on, another hidden piece of the puzzle falls in your lap and you're running with Yulia in a different direction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WOOLJUDSWIDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596438924#wasThisHelpful","R2WOOLJUDSWIDZ","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This selection of short stories told from the perspective of different servicemen doing a variety of different jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan and being affected in all kinds of ways delivers a powerful punch to the reader with its heartfelt and brutal honesty. Although the men serving and telling their stories are different and face all kinds of suffering and damage from what they saw and did, these servicemen have a lot in common, too (No. 1 being their honesty - no one is trying to hide anything; in fact, most of the narrators desperately want to share their stories to either a. have someone understand, b. have someone listen, even if they'll never understand, c. share the burden or d. admit, if not ease, the guilt and shame - shock someone by sharing your secrets into reaffirming how horrible you are). Each narrator is refreshingly genuine and regardless of how filthy the thoughts or language or how shocking their thoughts or deeds, somehow it all works to bring to life the colorful people in this book who for a variety of reasons, go off to defend our country and fight our wars.Many of the narrators share such intimately honest feelings and struggles, and their stories have a stunning depth and pull that won't let go of your attention - or your heart - for even a minute. The narrators open their lives to the reader, offering an up-close and personal look at what each of them went through and the impact each unique experience had on each service member. I could hear, see, smell and feel what the narrators heard, saw, smelled and felt. And I could learn, from what more than one narrator insisted, that despite listening to their stories, I can never truly understand because I'm not any of them; I wasn't there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R89IPRT450ZC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204993#wasThisHelpful","R89IPRT450ZC8","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite a government's lack of preparedness after a horrific accident at Chernobyl, despite promises broken, deadly compromises, a powerful and complete refusal to listen to facts, reason, and plans to save lives, people in Moscow and in the Ukraine show how big their hearts are as they make sacrifices for their family, friends, strangers and their country - even as that country's leaders betray them.The reader is given great privilege in being a part of several families' lives as they unfold in the aftermath of the fire at the nuclear power plant. Most of the characters' lives connect in some way; it was fascinating to connect the dots as one family does something to help another family, who returns the favor to someone the first family knows. ""All That is Solid Melts into Air"" is about ordinary (but captivating) people surviving (or finding a way to die with dignity and if possible, to die so that another loved one might live) and living their lives the best they can, despite bullying, poverty, political threats and snatching of choice and freedom, and ignorance that is forced by the government. I loved getting to know these people and being a witness to their courage, talent, and their capacity to love and forgive and start over - despite the pain and loss, their story is inspiring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRZ2QUC0SZEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062246879#wasThisHelpful","R1SRZ2QUC0SZEJ","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... until it's gone. At its core, "" 'Til the Well Runs Dry"" is a love story that spans 22 years. The story is told in three voices: that of Marcia Garcia; her lover, policeman Farouk Karam; and their second-born daughter, Jacqueline.Marcia Garcia is a teenager trying to single-handedly take care of 3-year-old twins who are not well. Her parents and sister are gone, and she sews to make enough money to keep the small family afloat. Then she meets policeman Farouk. Their story is unique - not at all like I thought it would be. Instead of being fireworks and the fairy-tale-like happily ever after, Farouk and Marcia (it's Mar-see-uh) share a turbulent relationship - where superstition and a kind of black magic, secrets left unshared, and trust shattered and not rebuilt - all work against them, despite hearts that truly do seem to beat for and reach out for each other. Marcia, Farouk and their family felt real and believable - and their troubles made their story come alive more. Without giving away too much of the story, let it suffice to say the lingering message I took away from their story is to look around and realize what's priceless in your life and appreciate what you have before it's too late.Hearing Jacqueline's sweet voice explain events in the story proved an effective and wonderful addition to the story. Jackie helped brighten up the story, give it more vibrant color and hope, and underline the goodness of her parents when they make bad decisions.Overall I enjoyed the book. Something is always happening - whether it be the mischief one of Marcia and Farouk's four children has found and immersed him- or herself in; or some danger or threat caused by Farouk's asking a strange witch-like obeah woman for help ensuring Marcia will always love him; or the fresh tragedies and trials for both Farouk (when a murder threatens his job) and for Marcia (when she moves from Trinidad to the United States for a new life). The characters are likable, colorful and very human - I kept wondering if Farouk was good or bad, and hadn't really made up my mind (and maybe Farouk wasn't sure about himself either) until the very end. I didn't care for the ending (it felt abrupt and unfinished), but it's a minor complaint and wouldn't keep me from recommending the book to someone who likes a different kind of love story - raw, real, tragic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZFCP9S32BE3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805098038#wasThisHelpful","R2ZFCP9S32BE3E","ADM7CHQGQHXKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADM7CHQGQHXKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love books, and have a library of close to a thousand volumes. I swore I wouldn't get an e-reader since they never look like real paper. The Kindle is the exception. It is light, battery life is great, and I can turn down the light until it looks pretty much like paper. It cuts down on weight for traveling, and hold plenty of books.

"I speak only a little French, but the infectious cheer in this album does not require translation. It is possible to hear the smile on her face while singing. It is a collection of covers of older French songs (with one original composition), the whole produced by Quincy Jones. The gradual transition from small ensemble sound in her earlier album ""Zaz"" to big band sound feels natural, and like Edith Piaf, to whom she is frequently compared, she handles the transition and material well. Also new in this album is the presence of several duets, with Thomas Dutronc, Charles Aznavour and Nikki Yanofsky. Zaz's voice and style is still present, however, and she has made excellent choices in her collaborators.Some of these songs were written during the occupation of Paris by German forces during WWII, and some of the press surrounding this album has been negative for that reason, saying it minimizes the suffering of the time. My own take is that, with lines like ""Plus on réduit son éclairage /Plus on voit briller son courage...Paris sera toujours Paris"" (The more you subdue her lights/ The more you see her courage shine...Paris will always be Paris) it demonstrates the refusal of the Parisians to let the hardship keep them down.It is exciting to watch a really talented artist develop her craft like this, and while the sound on this album is not the intimate, minimalist, street singer style that initially drew me to her music, it's still great listening.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5DCJASVN21J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI5RKBQ#wasThisHelpful","R2M5DCJASVN21J","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought a pair of these as a third year medical student, and wore them almost every day through the next eight years of medical training. That pair finally died, and this is my second. They are absolutely the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, and a price that works out to less than twenty dollars per year, they are an incredible deal. Walking in them takes a bit of practice to avoid twisting your ankle, but once you do, it's incredible.The advice I got for fit was to buy a half size too large, at least. If you can shove your toes as far forward as they'll go without bending and fit a single finger behind your heel, you have the right size. Any tighter won't breathe as effectively. Looser will slide too much.As with any shoe, your mileage may vary, and fit is a personal thing. But if you work in a field that involves lots of standing or walking, you should give these a shot.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36AO32UY8XXCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EJMRNO#wasThisHelpful","R36AO32UY8XXCZ","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic boomerang. In my hands it covers a roughly circular path about 40 yards across and returns exactly to the thrower's position, where it hovers and drops. It has a good hover, stays aloft over my head for 1-3 seconds, and the large center opening makes it easy to catch.

"These are great: firm, intact, well packed anchovies. I have tried the salt-packed, bone-in and skin-on versions as well, and I don't notice much of a difference, except in price. These are about twice as expensive as salt-packed, but the reduced hassle of using these might make that cost worthwhile to you. Regardless, these are cheaper here than buying them in a local store for me.The flavor, if you've never tried anchovies, is savory and buttery, not an overpowering ""fish"" flavor, especially cooked in sauces.

"These are exactly what I was looking for after reading Alice Waters' The Art of Simple Food. In that book she recommends these salt-packed anchovies for numerous recipes. And I have to say, after using them I can see why, though I will admit I don't notice a huge difference in flavor between these and the other anchovies I was buying, other than the cost, which works out about half as expensive for this bulk purchase. The hassle of soaking, then deboning these fillets may make the boned version the right choice for your kitchen.The flavor, if you've never tried anchovies at all, is buttery and savory, and not an overpowering ""fish"" flavor. It's fantastic and I highly recommend you experiment with them at least a few times.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP02BQDA7E6DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ESDVJS#wasThisHelpful","RP02BQDA7E6DE","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Certainly a timely and topical exploration of the difficulties inherent to intelligence gathering in the modern era. The premise is that intelligence is largely a technological pursuit in this era, and recruiting intelligence assets from a generation raised with open source ideals, which grew up with Napster, bittorrent and Wikileaks, is going to to be extremely difficult.  Furthermore, the conflicting loyalties an agent feels now are in ways very different, and in other ways much the same, that agents felt in the Cold War.I loved the premise, and for about 50% of the book I loved the development. But where this could have been a fantastic exploration of an important idea, the last half of the book felt like it was written by an autopilot going for a happily-ever-after ending. The kind of book that is great to discuss, but in which that discussion is more focused on ideas than characters.Recommended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RU5DNXJA63B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQUDUKG#wasThisHelpful","R2RU5DNXJA63B7","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
