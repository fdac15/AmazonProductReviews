"At about 4.5' tall, this lamp is the perfect height. It's not so tall that it gets in the way of things, but it's tall enough that it can light up much more than just the floor. The assembly process isn't nearly as bad as I was expecting, and during the assembly you get to feel the weight of each product which lets you know how high-quality of a product this is. Unfortunately this lamp isn't dimmable, which would have been nice, but you can change the angle of the lights which is great. I pointed them all at either the ground or the wall, which provides light without it shining directly in people's eyes. It's very nice to be able to play with the position of the lights to get exactly what you want, and the lamp still looks very good even with this functionality. The lamp is turned on with a button on the floor, I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be pressed with your foot. This can be very nice if your hands are full or something, but the floor button makes it difficult to tuck this light behind something in a corner because you need to be able to access the button on the floor. Overall it's a great lamp, and it's a very nice addition to my home. The price is exactly what I think this product is worth, so it's not INCREDIBLE for the price but it's not overpriced either.Note: I received this product for free in exchange for my evaluation, but that doesn't affect my review in any way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OR77AJRTM5B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW2DXSM#wasThisHelpful","R1OR77AJRTM5B1","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see many people complaining about the assembly for this lamp, and while it did take me about 45 minutes to assemble, the final product is worth it. You could easily pay $300+ for a lamp like this, and yeah, maybe that one will come assembled or at least have an easier assembly process. However, you aren't paying nearly that much for this lamp, and you are still getting the same quality in the finished product. The overall look of this lamp is great, it can improve the look of almost any room, no matter what the room design is. My only complaint is the red cord, it really doesn't go with the rest of the lamp at all and I'm not sure why Brightech decided to go with red for the cord. Other than the red cord however, I love this lamp. It looks great in my living room, and whenever I have people over at least one person comments on the lamp or asks where I got it. The best part is when I tell them the price, many people don't believe me. I've had several people go on their phones and order this lamp immediately after I tell them where to get it, people like it that much. The pictures on Amazon aren't THAT great however, I believe the lamp looks better in person.Note: I received this product for free in exchange for my evaluation but that doesn't affect my review in any way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T8I4ZBEN4PZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXJ4EXY#wasThisHelpful","R2T8I4ZBEN4PZE","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lamp is great for reading, as it doesn't take up a ton of space and it is still pretty bright. You can easily adjust the brightness, which is very nice, and its full white design can look good in modern homes. The red cable seems a little out of place, however, and I think I would prefer either a black or white cable. I also don't think this lamp would look very good in an old library or something similar, like I said it seems to be designed for more modern homes.Pros:- Very easy assembly- Bright- Dimmable- Flexible- Very white light- Very sturdily built- Tactile on/off switch, it gives a nice clicky sound when you turn it on and offCons:- Red cord- A little wobbly due to the somewhat-light baseOverall it's a very nice lamp, one that is great for studying or reading light. This lamp blows away many similar lamps in terms of build quality, and I'm sure you would pay much more for a lower-quality lamp in an actual store. I was received this lamp for free to review, and after using it for a bit I was very surprised when I saw how much it costs. I was expecting $100+, and for that price it would have been a good lamp. The fact that it's so much cheaper than that seems pretty crazy, as this is an excellent lamp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAPEPL6JBEH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SF99S9C#wasThisHelpful","RKAPEPL6JBEH1","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:41 Mins This item is definitely very cheap feeling, upon pulling it out of the box it doesn't feel like a high quality item at all. This was further enforced when the little tab broke off - instantly getting rid of many of this device's features (No longer Waterproof/Dustproof). The solar panel didn't really do anything to charge the power bank no matter how long I left it in the sun, and as I said the port-covering tab broke off so it was no longer Waterproof/Dustproof shortly after I got it. That leaves us with the LED light on the back, the charging indicators, and the shockproof-ness as features ""above a totally stripped down power bank"". These three features work quite well, and LED on the back is actually a very nice addition. It's kind of disappointing that roughly half of this power bank's features don't work right out of the box, but the features that do work work pretty well. I go much more in depth in the video, if you want to watch that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJVOGSVMQOGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJI70CK#wasThisHelpful","R1CJVOGSVMQOGI","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:01 Mins This player does what it's supposed to do very well, but for the price or even cheaper, you can get a player/writer from a name brand, and it will have more features and it will be of higher build quality. This ZhiZhu player is pretty cheaply made, as I show in the video. It looks really good and like I said, it does what it's supposed to do. I just think that what it's ""supposed to do"" isn't enough for the price that it costs. The addition of DVD writing would help, but currently I do not believe that this product is a very good choice considering the numerous (and even less expensive?) alternatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VOHA7AIKNJJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V34EX9Q#wasThisHelpful","R2VOHA7AIKNJJN","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:55 Mins In the video I cover what I like and dislike about this speaker, and I show the pairing process and how the speaker works. My least favorite thing about this speaker is the fact that you can't control the alert sounds' volume, such as when you turn on the speaker or turn down the volume too far. These alerts are really loud, and so you can be playing music really quietly and the speaker will be low on battery or something and play a really loud alert sound. If you are mostly using this outside or in a loud environment it is fine, but trying to use this speaker to quietly play music in a quiet environment will most likely be a somewhat aggravating experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13KWMHQ2FPXN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P68JDBS#wasThisHelpful","R13KWMHQ2FPXN9","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:03 Mins This speaker supposedly has many features that are in addition to its ""main"" Bluetooth function, such as a built in radio, a micro SD card slot, and an aux input option. Out of these features, I could get only the Bluetooth to work. I own at least 30 other Bluetooth Speakers, so I would say it's the speaker not working rather than user error. However I did not see an instruction manual included, and a manual could have possibly solved a few of my problems. This leaves us with a Water/Dust Resistant Bluetooth speaker that feels pretty cheap for its cost. If all of the other features worked as advertised it would be worth the money, but factoring in the build quality and the features that don't work I wouldn't say it's worth the money. The Water/Dust resistance does work very well, and the Bluetooth portion works very well. However it's still a pretty cheap-feeling speaker, and while all of the features could have made up for this, because they don't work, you're just left with a pretty cheap Bluetooth speaker.Note: I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KXEB6J810P99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4EEM0A#wasThisHelpful","R1KXEB6J810P99","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pillow itself comes with a sleeping mask, a couple sets of ear plugs, and some e-books about sleeping and such if you're interested in that. I didn't use anything but the pillow, but my experience with the pillow as been very positive. This pillow is quite a bit smaller than my other memory foam pillows, but the shape of this pillow is very nice for people with neck and back problems. I used to sleep funny on my neck and that was the only reason for my neck pain, but with this pillow I no longer experience any neck pain throughout the day. I think it's a little funny how good they claim this pillow to be, but it definitely is comfortable to sleep on and my sleep has been improved. The actual pillow comes in a purple ribbon inside the box, which again is a little funny, (I mean, it's a pillow), but I suppose it's a nice touch and it shows that Smarter Rest is really proud of their product. Their support + my recommendation + all of the other positive reviews for this pillow definitely point towards this being a good purchase, and I believe it will improve your sleeping experience. I didn't even think I could get a pillow much better than the one I was sleeping on before this one, and so if you are sleeping on an ""eh"" pillow currently, the difference will be astounding.Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest feedback.

" 5:20 Mins This power bank is great; it's easy to use, very portable, and it actually charges your phone a decent amount. I personally love the fact that it has a built in laser pointer, if you were honestly looking for a really good cat toy this would do. It's a re-chargeable laser pointer, something you don't see all that often. Compared to the little ones you see at the pet store or something, this one is a tiny bit more expensive but you won't have to buy specific batteries for it a week later. Of course its min purpose is being a power bank, but I think the addition of a laser pointer is great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BO64Y5TV7TU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q916CVA#wasThisHelpful","R3BO64Y5TV7TU2","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've reviewed several other ""Selfie Sticks"" in the past, and this one is definitely the most portable out of all of them. It only extends 31"", which is less than some selfie sticks, but I have found that extending any more than this causes the pole to bow and become very unstable. The main pole telescopes out from the handle like every other selfie pole, so this isn't the reason it's so portable. What makes it portable is the way the ""phone holder"" part at the top of the monopod folds down onto the handle when not in use. This creates a very compact package, making this Selfie pole ideal for traveling. There is only one con that I have seen - you can't actually remove the phone holder from the monopod. Theoretically you could still put a small point and shoot or a GoPro into the phone holder, but almost every other selfie pole I have seen has a feature where you can remove the phone mount and it reveals a 1/4"" threading for mounting the majority of cameras. This would be significantly more secure than putting your camera in the phone holder. So while you can still use this Selfie Pole with a standard camera, if you are going to be doing this frequently, I would definitely buy a different Selfie Stick. However if you are going to be using this strictly with your mobile phone, this is a great choice for these reasons -- The Selfie Stick is very well made, I can't imagine it breaking any time soon- The rubber on the handle provides very nice grip- It recharges quickly and then lasts a very long time- You can adjust the angle at which your phone sits at the top of the pole- There is a built-in camera button, no timers or using an external remote or anything- There is a wrist strap for added security, but you can easily remove this if you want toOverall this is a great selfie stick if you are wanting to take photos with your mobile phone and only your mobile phone, but due to the inability to remove the phone holder and mount a ""real"" camera directly using a tripod threading, I would look elsewhere if you are planning on using a camera or a GoPro rather than a mobile phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R74HA212KAHCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI2HCS4#wasThisHelpful","R74HA212KAHCX","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not so sure about the supposedly added Pheromones and such inside of this cologne, I haven't noticed any females being more interested in me or anything like that. However, many people (especially people of the opposite gender) have commented on how great the cologne smells. I personally love the smell of it, and while more than 2 squirts is pretty overpowering, if you have the right amount on, you'll smell great all day.

"What we get in the box are 6 individual boxes each containing a bubble-wrapped lightbulb. Unfortunately, one of the light bulbs still managed to break. I didn't take off a star because when I received this lightbulb kit it was in a very, very large box containing many other items. It was definitely moving around quite a bit inside of this box, and so I'm sure this is why one of the bulbs broke. If you were to order this item individually, I can almost guarantee you would be perfectly fine. I'm sure if I contacted Brightech they would replace the broken bulb or do even better than that without blinking an eye. I received these samples for free in exchange for my honest feedback so I'm not going to contact Brightech for a replacement, but most companies that offer an 18 month warranty have very good customer service.As for the actual lights -These would look very cool if you had the actual bulb showing, such as in a clear-glass lamp or something similar. The shape is different than your ""traditional"" light bulb, and the filaments inside the bulb are also very different. I unfortunately don't have any lights that would show the bulbs off, but I put them in the lights above my kitchen table. These lights are dimmable, so I was a little worried about how well the bulbs would work. I'm happy to say that the bulbs work on a dimmer switch, and they work even better than a lot of bulbs. Especially above a kitchen table, these light bulbs create very nice mood lighting. They give off a very orange light, and because they're only 40w, they create just enough light to see but not much more than that. Reading under these lights would be difficult, but if you're going for that fancy-restaurant type atmosphere, these bulbs are great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMX2CK63UMD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP9ZWZQ#wasThisHelpful","RFMX2CK63UMD6","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little device will take music playing from a phone, iPod, mp3 player, etc. and amplify the sound, as the title says. This is all without any wires, set up, or Bluetooth. What surprised me was that it actually worked; and it worked pretty well.This product requires 3 AA batteries, and once you've put them in and turned on the Signal Booster, you've done really all of the setup that you need to do. You then just start playing music through a device's speaker (The device must have a built in speaker, some iPods and MP3 players won't work) and set the device on the amplifier. Make sure to place the device's speaker towards the blue light/power button on the amplifier, and if you don't hear your music being amplified, slide your device around a little until you do. If you're still having trouble, make sure the amplifier is on and try turning up the music on your device a bit.The amplifier is about the size of a standard computer mouse, so if you were wanting to travel with it or something you definitely could. There are also little rubber feet to prevent the signal booster from sliding around, and the entire signal booster is coated in a rubbery-plastic material that feels good, and it will prevent your phone/iPod from sliding around.The only con with this product is the fact that the amplified signal can be very distorted. If you are using this at pretty low volumes you shouldn't have any problem, but once you reach a volume slightly louder than what the iPhone 6 can output, the signal starts becoming distorted. The louder you go, the more distortion there is. This device can easily make a good song not worth listening to, so you will be fairly limited with volume on this device.Overall, this device's simplicity and ease of use outweighs the lack of overall quality. I wouldn't say that this device is worth any more than $15, and it's currently priced at $20. However if you don't care much about sound quality or you aren't looking to play music all that loudly, this isn't a bad product to spend your money on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDOP5B0TKOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH2YFU6#wasThisHelpful","R1SDOP5B0TKOB","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I personally use these keys on a Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate. This keyboard doesn't have any key indicators, so the metal keys give me a good reference point while typing AND they look really cool. I was expecting the keys so get greasy/collect fingerprints really easily, but that is not the case. The keys have a very nice weight to them, so when you first pick them up you get the indication that you have purchased a high-quality product. Because of the weight I thought typing on these keys would feel different than the rest of the keys, but I'm happy to say that that's not the case.

"My carpet looks pretty clean to the naked eye, but simply turning this light on changed my mind. I can see stains that I thought I cleaned up, and while I can't normally see them, I can see them with this light. I shined this around my cats' litter box and I noticed that they didn't always make it. So many things were exposed with this light, I can't believe I walk around bare footed on this carpet. As for the actual light, it does its job very well; disgustingly well. The light is turned on by pushing a button on the back, so one handed operation is easy. The flashlight is made out of metal, so you will be able to gross yourself out for a long time due to this light's durability. The wrist strap seems unnecessary, but I guess if you see something super disgusting and you want to drop the light, the strap will make sure the gross thing doesn't go away by keeping the light on your wrist. The flashlight takes 3 AAA batteries, and I was very happy that they were included. To put the batteries in you just unscrew the back of the light, nothing super complicated. You can also unscrew the top of the light apparently, although it takes a bit longer (more threading). If you remove both the back/bottom and the top of the light and then take out the batteries, it becomes a hollow tube. This seems pretty useless but maybe it's for cleaning the inside of the light or something. It's also possible that TaoTronics just wanted you to be able to access the batteries from either side of the light, but I'm not sure. Overall I would recommend this light for anyone that wants to A) Clean up blood after a murder B) See how disgusting their carpet really is C) Identify counterfeit money D) Have a great little portable blacklight. It's good for many things, and it's not even that expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FO2FSHJ4Q49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RV8PREI#wasThisHelpful","R39FO2FSHJ4Q49","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wallet looks and feels very nice - the only thing I noticed was that it attracts fingerprints very easily. The fingerprints are also pretty difficult to wipe off, just something to keep in mind. In a closed position the wallet is a little bit bigger than a credit card and roughly 10x as thick. The hinge and casing both feel like they're going to last a while, which is nice to see on something that you use as frequently as a wallet. You push a little button at the top to open the wallet, and it simply snaps closed. Inside of the wallet is a little plastic fan that is very well set in place. You can remove it if you wish, but it is attached in a way that is meant to be permanent. It's attached enough that it won't come out with use, but if you really wanted to remove it you could. With the fan in place I was able to fit 7 cards inside of the wallet. I put in the 8th card and then the wallet wouldn't stay closed. I've seen some people remove the fan and fit a few more cards in, but then all of your cards and such are super unorganized and I'm not sure why you would want to do that. It's personal preference, but I like the fan. I personally carry quite a few cards. I have gift cards that I carry around just in case, as well as all my credit/debit cards, membership cards, and my ID. This adds up to about 12 cards, which is simply too much for this wallet. 7 was the limit with the fan in place; even less if you actually want to carry any cash. As for the RFID blocking, I don't really have any way of testing it. I didn't get this wallet for that purpose, but I read one review that says it isn't totally RFID safe. If you are looking specifically for the RFID blocking feature, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. If you don't carry many cards and you are looking for a stylish, high-quality wallet, this is a great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZ1X4SFD199X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ8PEWE#wasThisHelpful","R1BZ1X4SFD199X","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:23 Mins I don't really enjoy the style of wallet cases, I mostly use rugged cases. However, this is a very, very nice wallet style case. It's not even necessarily just how good the case is that makes it a worthy purchase, it's all of the other factors that come with the case: The lifetime warranty, the excellent packaging, the glass screen protector.

"There are many dual port USB car chargers, but this one adds two USB ports while still giving you access to three Cigarette Lighter ports. We have a 2.1A USB port that will charge cell phones and small devices optimally, and then we have a 1A port that will charge much older phones. Unfortunately there is no 2.4A port, so tablets and larger devices will experience slower charging times. When plugged in, this device looks very cool. The insides of the ports light up blue, along with little pieces on the top. Included with the device is an extra fuse and two adhesive pads for adhering this device to your car. The device is small; about the size of a pack of cards. This allows it to fit comfortably in your car without really having to make room for it. Overall this is a very useful device. If you find yourself needing to charge several devices while driving, this is definitely a great option. It will allow you to charge two USB devices and 3 devices powered via cigarette lighter. Some cars have 3 cigarette lighters, but this one puts them all in the same place and adds more regardless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S69SEQ265KPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F474DVG#wasThisHelpful","R2S69SEQ265KPU","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This charger is almost exactly the same size as the one included with Apple's iPads, but this one has two USB ports rather than one. Both of these ports are 2.4A, meaning that they can charge larger devices at optimal speeds even if you are charging two devices at once. The device is compact, as I said it's the same size as the iPad's USB-Wall adapter. Because of this it only takes up one outlet space and it doesn't cover any spaces. The charger has prongs that can fold up into the device, so it's very good for traveling. When you plug this device into the wall, the insides of the USB ports light up. They aren't obnoxiously bright, just bright enough that you can plug things into them in the dark. The overall design is a sleek black, with a simple MyOho logo and some information about the device. It can get a little greasy from picking it up with your hands, but no fingerprints stuck to it. Overall this is a great compact little device. It will allow you to free up wall space by compacting two USB-Wall adapters into one. What I think is impressive is that it's the same size as one of the iPad's chargers, but it's charging capabilities are equivalent to two of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KM6GDAO5GQ2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4H65SU#wasThisHelpful","R2KM6GDAO5GQ2Q","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This charger is very large; I have 6 port chargers that are smaller, or at least the same size. This makes this device take up two outlet spaces, so even though it only uses one it covers the other. It may be ideal to plug this into an extension cord or something similar because of this. The charger does exactly as it says, and it does it very well. This device allows you to be rid of multiple USB-Wall adapters, and instead you just have this one charger. The charger plugs into the wall, and you can charge up to 4 USB devices simultaneously. We have 2 2.4A ports or ""PowerCharger"" ports, and we have 2 2.1A ports or ""Universal"" ports. Older phones or smaller devices will only need 2.1A to change at the optimal speed, but if you were to plug an iPad into a 2.1A port it would charge very slowly. For this reason there are two ""PowerCharger"" ports. This will allow you to charge larger devices at the highest possible speed, rather than being stuck with only 2.1A ports. It would've been nice to see ""Smart"" ports that automatically adjust the amperage based on the type of device you are trying to charge, it's just a little less convenient to have to pay attention to what port you're plugging your device into. Overall this device charges things very quickly, and while it is very bulky, it's less bulky than 4 separate USB-Wall adapters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU91R2P4YXTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q84XRAC#wasThisHelpful","RJU91R2P4YXTG","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the box we find the Keyboard, the User Manual, and the Micro-USB charging cable. The keyboard contains a lithium battery so you don't have to worry about the battery's memory if you decide to charge the keyboard before it's totally dead. This is the first wireless backlit keyboard that I have ever seen, and it looks a lot nicer than your average bluetooth keyboard because of this. I've mostly been using this keyboard on Mac, so I will mostly be reviewing it based on my experience with that particular platform.Build Quality -The description for this keyboard says it's stainless steel but in reality the only stainless steel you see while using this keyboard is a little strip along the bottom. The entire back of the keyboard is stainless steel, but you don't see that while typing. The material used still strengthens the keyboard so that even though the keyboard's face is plastic, it feels like a high quality keyboard. The keys all feel very sturdy while typing; on some cheaper keyboards I have noticed the keys to be a bit sticky or wobbly. On this keyboard typing is really easy and all of the keys register perfectly. I have also noticed some delay on certain Bluetooth keyboards, but I didn't find any with this one. The only small thing that I've noticed is the Spacebar is really squeaky. Every other key sounds pretty normal, but the Spacebar squeaks whenever I press it with any reasonable amount of speed, and it can be really annoying while typing, I can't imagine that this is meant to be this way, so there's a good chance that you won't have this problem.Keys -This isn't necessarily the quality of the keys because I went over that up there ^^^, this is more of the specific keys and their functions. One thing I noticed is that if you are used to typing on a Mac keyboard, the bottom left key order is different. On Mac's it goes ""Fn, Control, Option/Alt, Command"" but on this keyboard it goes ""Control, Function, Windows, Alt"". The Windows key on this keyboard functions as the Command key on Mac, but its placement has me constantly hitting the Alt key instead of the Win/CMD key. I am used to having the Command Key closest to the Spacebar, and that's not the case with this keyboard. We also have a special button not found on normal keyboards, and this button controls the brightness/color of the backlight. This key is on the right side, and it replaces the second Win/CMD key that would be found on a standard keyboard. This means the only Command key is on the left hand side of the keyboard, which could make certain commands a little difficult. Pressing this key switches the backlight between [Off], [Dim], and [Bright]. To switch between our 7 color options we hold down this key and press the up/down arrows. This switches between the keyboard's colors, and then you can change the brightness as I said. Another thing that is a little annoying is the need to hold down the Fn key to press Escape. On Mac I haven't found that the upper left key does anything except when holding Fn to make it function as the escape key which is used pretty frequently. This means in certain key command you are having to hold down the Fn button as well, whereas normally you would just be able to press escape. I'm not sure if there is a way to change this, but this is how it is originally set up. The escape key functions as the Home key on iPad, and there is no need to press the Fn key if you are using it for that. Our ""C"" key functions as the Bluetooth connection key. It's normal function is the letter C of course, but when you hold down Fn and press C the keyboard will go into pairing mode. This is an alternate to a dedicated Bluetooth button, and unless the fairly large Bluetooth logo on the C key annoys you, I think giving the C key two functions was a good idea. This keyboard is also lacking an eject button, which can be a huge turn-off for people that rely on this key. Many modern Laptops don't even have an Optical drive but if yours does and you need to use it, you will have to find another way to eject disks. On a Macbook Pro, I found the only alternative was to press the built in eject button. This kind of defeats the purpose of a separate, wireless keyboard, but if you don't use the Eject function all that often it's not a big deal.Battery -While the battery on this keyboard isn't as good as other Bluetooth keyboards I have used, it still boasts a 64 hour battery life. This is about what I got out of it, and I never turned the Keyboard off. I relied on it going to sleep, and it didn't consume much battery power while it was in this mode. After a few seconds of inactivity the Backlight automatically turns off, which definitely helps with conserving battery power. The good news is that even if this keyboard dies, you can just recharge it. So many Bluetooth keyboards require either AA or AAA batteries, and rechargeable keyboards are much, much nicer in my opinion. This keyboard can supposedly go 100 days without dying while in standby mode, but I haven't had it long enough to test that.Weird connection issue -The only actual problem I have had with this keyboard is its ability to maintain connection. I am currently typing this review on this GMYLE keyboard connected to a Macbook Pro that is connected to an external display. The MacBook is charging, and it is 8 inches from this keyboard. This keyboard has become disconnected 6 times throughout the typing of this review. I get a little notification that says ""connection lost"" and then 5 seconds later, automatically without me doing anything, I get another notification that says ""connected"". I'm not sure why this is, I haven't had any problems with my other Bluetooth keyboards in this exact setup. I haven't seen other reviewers mentioning this, so maybe there's something interfering with my connection, but it has been really annoying.Overall this is a really nice looking keyboard. The backlight allows you to type in the dark, and it makes the keyboard look cool. Not only does it have a backlight, but you can customize the color and brightness. This makes for a really nice keyboard, and the stainless steel design enforces this. My only major complaints are it randomly disconnecting and the squeaky space bar. The other things  (the lack of an eject button, the order of the lower left buttons and having to hold down Fn to access Escape) are annoying, but they can be worked around and I wouldn't consider them to be major flaws. I didn't drop a star for it disconnecting just because most of the features of this keyboard are really nice, and I think it disconnecting is something I and only I am experiencing. I could be wrong about this, and if you also experience this feel free to comment on this review so the people know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183PJYOFHPQNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RMF9V1U#wasThisHelpful","R183PJYOFHPQNL","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been trying to find a silk or leather corded necklace for some of my pendants. They all seemed to have terrible reviews, so I opted for this rubber one. I have several sterling silver chains, but some larger pendants just look nicer and stand out more on a black or red cord. The cord itself seems sturdy and can hold my huge sterling silver jade pendant with no issues. This product does need some reshaping as it arrives a bit bent and lumpy. This material should warm to your skin and lay correctly eventually. You can also stretch this a little, but be gentle. The clasp has a tiny stamp on it indicating sterling silver. Not sure what the other parts are made of.This style is fine for a man or woman. It is 4mm, so make sure that the bale on your pendant can fit on this. Some charms may need an enhancer. If you have a thicker neck, you may want to consider going up one size from what one with a skinny neck would wear. This is a decent cord for many different looks, whether you are a rock n roller, goth, into new age crystals, or just want something to show off a cute charm. With theâ€‹ right enhancer, this can also provide a new twist to elegant estate pieces and give them a fresh new look.So although this cord costs more than many other black cords on Amazon, it doesn't seem like a piece of junk that will break in a month. I do not wear my necklaces all the time, so I cannot speak as someone who does that or as someone who would wear this in the shower.  I took off one star for it being bent and warped. I was not happy at all about that, but it seems to be coming into the proper shape a little at a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFCLYRPAS09K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZTVQXI#wasThisHelpful","R3AFCLYRPAS09K","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a neat toy for food motivated dogs. There is a wide opening for larger sized kibble or treats. The ball is solid and well made. I have used other treat balls, but this one is a little fancier than the ones I had in the past. I find that these treat balls work well with special needs dogs who tend to be fearful or nervous. This helps take their mind off of things and makes for something nice for them to play within the safety of their crate.Unlike some other treat balls, this one is not see-thru at all. It does, however, make a neat noise. For the price, it is definitely one of the better treat ball toys out there. The only improvement' I see for this toy would be to make the opening adjustable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HN1KJZMHID3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWDYG5C#wasThisHelpful","R2HN1KJZMHID3D","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Afterglow has really created a fantastic wireless headset. I have used some other wireless headsets and it seemed like there was always some static or popping/crackling in the background. With The Afterglow AG9 headset, it was perfect sound with any kind of noise interference. Sound quality was outstanding and perfect.I was able to play for a good 6 hours (documentation says 16 hours of worry free use) and the rechargeable battery showed no signs of giving out. I was able to get at the 40 feet distance and did not suffer sound quality.Easy to setup with my PS4. Plug in USB Wireless adapter follow directions for setting up with PS4 and done. Very easy.Mic: Works great. It has noise canceling so you're not hearing what is going on in the room while your playing. The voice commands worked well using the mic and as long as you werenâ€™t mumbling or had the mic to far away from you, it worked perfectly. I also liked the fact that you could remove it because not all games use the mic and while it isnâ€™t in the way or a bother it was nice to be able to remove it if not needed.Comfort. This is probably the only area of the Afterglow AG9 where I will have to be critical. Let me say if you are a small kid or someone who has a small head, these I imagine will be perfect for you. However, I am an adult and have a larger head and ears. If you are only going to use these for a short time, this will not be an issue. If you wear them for that 6 hours I mentioned before  then expect some discomfort. After 6 hours, I had to remove the headset because it was starting to hurt. Having a larger ear piece or maybe an oval shape vice round would be better for an adult or someone with a larger head. Because of the discomfort I got at the bottom and back of my ears I gave this four stars instead of the five I wanted to give it.If you are getting this for a child or someone with a small head then they are fantastic and worth the value! While I will continue to use these I just wonâ€™t be wearing them for as long as I might like to be able to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2FXMCFR9NS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016K12406#wasThisHelpful","RW2FXMCFR9NS7","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this type of crate is for dogs that are calm and crate trained. I use this as a travelling crate for my 30 lb mini Shar-Pei. There is plenty of room for her and this keeps her safe in case of an accident, as she just can't jump out if something spooks her. I was previously using a soft crate made by Nature's Miracle. They make an excellent crate, but the size I purchased was big enough for a 70lb dog. The height was blocking the view of my rear window. That is the only reason I replaced it with this one for travelling. I did not buy a smaller Nature's Miracle Crate because they are very expensive and I do not use the crate on a daily basis.This EliteField crate is pretty nice and comes with some bells and whistles that the Nature's Miracle one did not.  There is a storage area on the top and it also comes with a little ""pocket book"" on the back. These are great features for dog owners who need to haul medical paperwork around when the dog is sent to a specialist. It will probably be most useful to those who show their dogs in the ring. It is also handy for storing copies of paperwork pertaining to rabies shots, which groomers and other dog services require. This also comes with an okay crate liner. I had to use a separate Kong bed for my last crate. The liner for this one is a little on the thin side, so I cover it with a soft blanket.Now, to the not so good. The mesh on this crate is not as fine as some other soft crates. This should not be a major issue for those whose dogs know how to behave in a crate, but there is more of a risk of a nail getting caught in it than other brands. There is also no way to access the inside of the crate from the top. Only the front and side. I also feel that the zippers are not quite as smooth working as on my last crate.This stands up and collapses about as well as my Nature's Miracle crate. For the price, (about $60) this is a decent crate for transporting a calm dog or using it as a safe place for a smaller dog to hide & sleep. If you are not sure if your dog will behave in this type of crate, opt for a hard plastic crate instead for travelling. Always make sure never to leave collars on a dog the inside of any crate. If you need to hook your dog onto a leash quickly within the crate, use a harness instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNB9HIIHBVJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ABCBBQ#wasThisHelpful","RGNB9HIIHBVJO","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of the Turbie Twist and own several of them. I was hesitant to accept this product at first because it reminded me of the early versions of head wraps from Asia that had the button on the top. Many people complained about their hair getting caught in the button. I didn't see any complaints about this in the reviews for this product and for good reason, too. These have the button on the bottom and does not catch any hair.While I really like the Turbie Twist, these DII ones are superior in a few ways. I usually do not use these for dry hair, but I wanted my hair to be out of the way while I took a bath. The Turbie Twist was not able to cover all of my long, thick hair and became loose. The DII ones covered almost all of my hair and it was not a hassle to secure. Out of the shower, both do well, but the DII is better for long hair. I use two of these after washing my hair like I do with the Turbie Twist. I wear one right after squeezing out the excess water, then after about 10-15 minutes put on another fresh, dry one to be worn for about an hour.If you haven't tried a drying head wrap for your hair, give this a try. You will wonder why you didn't start using these earlier. Both these are and the microfiber version of the Turbie Twist are much better for your hair than a terry towel. If your hair is halfway down your back or longer, opt for these as they are longer. They are also a bit softer than the Turbie Twist but just as thirsty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGNBDW891R5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBMEBVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VGNBDW891R5S","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to protect my Shar-Pei's ears in the bath. She is a small dog, so I ordered the smallest size which fit her okay. The band loosens when she shakes her head so next time I may have to place a towel or cloth under it. I really don't want to give this a bad review as I am not using it as it was intended. I do think that $16.95 is a bit steep for these. It's worth about half of that. When using for kids, these need to be used with ear plugs.

"It was time for me to get a real jewelry box. I had an attractive one, but it was old and made from particle board. I have been acquiring more chains, pendants and earrings and wanted to have them stored properly instead of being in a box inside of a small drawer. I wanted a flat type box with lots of compartments for my earrings, but where I could also hang my chains. I was about to give up when I came across this one. It was the look I wanted, a nice dark color and was reasonably priced. When I received it, I was very happy to see how attractive this box is in person.The locks seem to work well. Both levels lock and not just the top, unlike many other ""locking"" boxes. This comes with two sets of keys. There are plenty of hooks to hang chains and compartments to lay down longer chains. The pouch under the hooks has sections, but they are not stitchedâ€‹ down. The acrylic section is removable, but I use it to place my tiny stud earrings. This is such a gorgeous and well made jewelry box. The lining is well done and the hinges are sturdy.This box is for someone with a good amount of pieces, but I don't think someone with a ton of jewelry will be able to fit it all in here.

"I was only going to buy one pack of Twinkle razors, but this seller offered these at a much better price per pack. These razors are good for shaping the top of your eyebrows as well as being a beginners tool for dermaplaning.

I clean mine with rubbing alcohol after each use.Although the risk for getting cut with a Twinkle is low, it can happen if you are too rough or go over the same spot too many times. Just let the razor do its job and don't apply too much pressure. These can also be used to remove annoying hair from the belly or toes.For under $8, this pack was a good deal.

"This is real soap, not a detergent. It is labeled as Castile soap, but real Castile is made with 100% olive oil. This creates a slippery soap without much lather, so many soap makers add other oils to either cut costs or create more bubbles. This one has coconut oil, hemp oil, and some other oils. This is mostly unscented, although there is some kind of slight smell. I am wondering if this could be from the hemp oil which smells terrible on its own.I'm using this soap to make my own shaving lotion. Any of Dr Bonner's scents will work, but the unscented allows for more customization. The 32oz is a generous size and only costs a few dollars more than the 16oz. This is a great all purpose soap that can be used as an ingredient in household cleaners or beauty products. This is not a baby shampoo in the way that it is ""tearless."" Again, this is actual soap made from oils and lye. Of course, it can be used on its own in the shower. You can even add your own essential oils to it and fragrance it yourself.Overall, this is a great base soap for making your own shaving creams, shampoos, etc. You can buy plastic soap pump bottles cheap, but I prefer to spend a little more and buy glass ones.

"Who would want powdered bleach? Probably someone who doesn't want to lug a heavy jug of bleach around or someone who has arthritis. Clorox bleach crystals a good idea if you have a large cleaning project coming up. These are definitely less clumsy than messing around with liquid bleach. For laundry, these can go right into the tub of your He machine. No more splashes, no more ruined laundry.This is a good product, but there are a few issues with it. The crystals do not dissolve easily without stirring, especially in cold water. You will need some bleach proof tool to stir this with. Some may not want t deal with the extra step of having to mix this product up. The crystals also make it hard to target stains as opposed to using gel bleach, which is my prevered product. I also find that the gel works faster and is more powerful.Overall, this is a handy product to have. The bottle fits perfectly in my washer storage drawer and the measuring cap on top is a smart idea. This would be a great product for anyone with issues carrying heavy liquid bottles and could really be an asset to big projects that require a substantial amount of bleach. For everyday use it would be good for mopping and giving the toilet a quick clean. While I like this product, I think I will go back to using Clorox bleach gel as I am more comfortable using it in my washing machine. The gel is also better for targeting random stains and applying to grout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YFAXR0ZJJ62P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EVP2UG#wasThisHelpful","R1YFAXR0ZJJ62P","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charcoal bags are a great way to absorb odors from gym lockers, garages, and even pet kennels. I am using this bag in a room with chinchillas who constantly smell of urine. I used to be able to wash one of the cages out every two weeks, but as they have gotten older, they no longer get along and I cannot put them together in the rabbit's cage where my late bunny would act as moderator. The cages get cleaned daily but are not hosed down with water & Lysol like they used to be. This leaves a faint lingering smell of pee, but even when they were washed out, the smell would come back a few days later anyway. I hung the bag in between the two cages and the smell is reduced. I was also using an oil diffuser but have not used it at all since hanging this bag up.

I buy these quite often at the commissary, but they only have the red ones. These blue ones are very nice too. I drink a lot of water so the large size is appreciated.

"Solid Gold usually makes decent kibble. This one is not bad, although it does contain white potato which can be inflammatory to some dogs. This is a lower protein food which is ideal for certain breeds. Some may be concerned about this food being produced in the Diamond Pet Food plants. I would contact the company with any questions about that. Most of the ingredients in this are good. Fresh eggs would be better than powdered ones, but if you are feeding kibble, this shouldn't be a huge issue anyway.The rescue dogs I work with do way better on this food than any of the more common brands. There is no corn or wheat to cause itching or bad gas.Overall, this is a good kibble to try if you are trying to feed your dog something better than supermarket kibble. This is a pricier brand, but it seems to be cheaper if you buy the 24lb bag ($2.70 a lb) vs the 4lb bag ($5.75 a lb).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6POA5U8DETV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIG7BG#wasThisHelpful","RW6POA5U8DETV","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maca root (Lepidium Peruvianum) boasts many benefits including improving mood, energy enhancement and even a boost in sexual wellness. This product is powdered maca in raw form. It can be used in cooked recipes or added or added to smoothies. The taste is similar to kohlrabi in my opinion. It does not taste like ginseng at all in case you were wondering. I actually like the smell better than the taste, but I think a small amount of this can easily be hidden in a stew or baked dish. This powder does not dissolve in cool water very well, so I would try to find another way to consume it.This comes in a zip type bag inside of another heavy plastic bag. I put mine into a tinted pint-sized mason jar for easier access and to keep it fresh.There is some disagreement as to whether maca root should be eaten in its raw state. I personally have no problems consuming it this way, but if one prefers to, I don't see why they cannot heat this powder up mixed with some olive or coconut oil and prepare it the same way golden paste (a Tumeric based health remedy)  is made.I personally prefer using maca to a multi-vitamin. I won't claim this will perform any miracles, but it does give me a bit of an energy boost and helps combat my mid-day slump.  I would say give this a try. If you don't like it at first, try a few different ways. Some may like it in coffee, others may like a spoonful in a soup. Some may just hate it. I feel this way about ginseng. I have tried to like it, but it is just tastes disgusting to me.Maca should be avoided at bedtime, as well as by anyone with thyroid issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DVY8AOUZPLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1WVEF2#wasThisHelpful","R9DVY8AOUZPLQ","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this set on eBay (for $13 less), but they are the same earrings from the same seller (GemStoneKing.) The picture is misleading, but when these arrived they looked like what I'd expected. They are small, but the colors are very pretty. The peridot is my favorite, but they all have nice color & sparkle. I prefer this small size for my second piercing. The earrings are on the dainty side, but they are not what I would call flimsy. I have a couple of pairs of sterling silver earrings that have bent posts and are not as nice as these, even though I paid more for them. The backs of these are very tiny, so if you have big fingers or long nails, you may have a hard time putting these on. You definitely don't want to mess around with these near a sink where they can fall in and get lost. I have not experienced any irritation wearing these. I am using one of them now for my helix (cartilageâ€‹) piercing. It barely fits, but it hasn't fallen off nor is it bothering me at all.These are clearly stated as 4mm, so those complaining about the size have nothing but their own ignorance to blame for that.

I love caramel, but I have tasted much better ones than these. The ingredients are low quality, which I normally wouldn't be too picky about for a junk food product, but Hershey's has driven away many consumers who want a better tasting sweet. In response to this, instead of improving their product, they have worked to block the sale of the superior British versions of their sweets in the US.If you are looking for corn syrup laden, below average' tasting caramels made by a greedy US company who hates the free market, by all means, buy these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15K0LMLU3ZV3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","R15K0LMLU3ZV3J","A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cole Cohen has spent her life struggling through school. She has been unable to learn how to drive, and anything involving science or math are a lost cause.  Her parents have subjected her to numerous tests, which have revealed that she has a learning disability of some type.Although the testing reveals little, Cole and her parents keep pushing and asking questions. Finally she is given an MRI which reveals a lemon sized hole in her brain.At first Cole believes that since the problem is finally diagnosed, it can be fixed.  Yet, there is no fix for her problem. Instead, Cole must learn to live with and compensate for her disability.Cole is highly intelligent and has been compensating for her disability for years, yet there are certain things she cannot overcome - such as her inability to accurately see and react to objects in motion (which makes driving impossible and crossing the street perilous as well).  As she attempts to find organizations that could give her assistance, she finds many obstacles as her disability is so unique and unusual.Head Case was interesting and well written, allowing readers to see Cohen for the intelligent woman she is, despite the one area of her brain that makes some day to day encounters impossible for her.Cohen's honesty about her struggles and her triumph over them make this a fantastic memoir.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMBZDRIV6VR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791892#wasThisHelpful","R3KMBZDRIV6VR5","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a long time since I opened up a book the day it arrived in the mail and was able to sit down and read it in one sitting.  (In fact, the last time I remember doing this was with Roger Rosenblatt's Making Toast which was published in 2011).  But, over spring break I had the pleasure of opening a package containing Ellen McCarthy's The Real Thing: Lessons on Love and Life From a Wedding Reporter's Notebook. And I was able to sit down and read and read, until I turned the last page of this book.  McCarthy's book is full of little bits of wisdom about relationships and marriage as well as stories about a variety of the people she came to know because of her job.McCarthy spent several years as a wedding reporter for the Washington Post.  As a writer who enjoys writing about people, this job was right up her alley, despite the fact that her obtaining this job coincided neatly with a break-up with her boyfriend.  McCarthy was going to be spending a lot of times at weddings and with people in love while she got over her own broken heart.McCarthy's book is nicely arranged by topic:  dating, commitment, breakups, weddings and making it last, providing a little something for everyone no matter what stage in a relationship you may find yourself.  But I would encourage readers to read and take to heart the advice offered in each section.There are many little gems I have taken away from this book.  And already I feel as though I should be going through it again, marking passages to think about a bit more.Just a few bits of advice I managed to take note of:1.  Be kind to each other.  Look for a spouse who is kind.2.  The lyrics from a Don Henley song in reference to always thinking that someone else has it better, ""To want what I have; To take what I'm given with grace.""3.  The type of love that comes like a thunderbolt may not be the kind that lasts.One of my favorite couples McCarthy introduced me to is octogenarians Betty and Edgar, a couple who had been wed for sixty five years.  When asked if they believed that there wast just one special person they were destined to be with, the two laughed hysterically. They went on to explain that they believe that had they met other people they would also be happily married for sixty plus years - that's the type of people they are, the type that believe in commitment.There are lots of other great stories and a treasure trove of wisdom in this book.  The Real Thing may become the essential guide for every couple to read and discuss prior to getting married.  Already married for seventeen years, I still managed to find this book fascinating and timely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFX4UALPK4TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549694#wasThisHelpful","R2SFX4UALPK4TO","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Riley has spent her life trying to find herself, or to find peace, after her brother Mick is  MIA in Vietnam.Following Riley over the course of two and a half decades, it is easy to see that the loss of the older brother she idolized and adored has made going on with her own life impossible.  To add to her troubles, the boy she falls in love with, Darrell, has also been drafted, and unable to deal with losing another person she cares about, she breaks things off with him.Riley keeps moving, settling for a time in California, and visiting Vietnam which is the last place her brother lived.  She tries drugs and makes friends with other people who are also struggling through life.One of my favorite parts of The Given World was the letter Riley's mother wrote her explaining how she could allow her child to leave, how losing Mick made it hard for her to go on as well.  This letter gave such a better picture into Riley's home life and revealed a lot about her parents, especially her mother.It was hard to read Riley's story, which seemed self-destructive. She went from one bad decision to the next, yet I also always held out hope for her.The Given World is a beautifully written story about a woman whose heart has been broken and who tries to find a way to get by in life without the brother she loves.  What she eventually discovers is that running away doesn't take away the pain, and you can always go home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFKH7J7CKK10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476777934#wasThisHelpful","R2EFKH7J7CKK10","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there is ever a story that reaffirms how important online safety is, SJ Watson's newest novel, Second Life, (to be published in June) is it.As the story begins,  Julia is trying to cope with the death of her younger sister who was murdered one night when she was walking alone in Paris.  Her husband would like her to see a counselor to help her, but instead when Julia discovers her sister's online activities include cybersex she begins an attempt to locate the person who may have killed her sister or know something about the murder.Although Julia thinks she is being safe, the online relationship she begins with Lukas is more than just virtual and the two quickly meet in real life and begin an affair. And there is a whole lot more to Lukas than what Julia initially believes.As soon as Julia began cheating on her husband, I had a hard time liking her much.  And for me, I like having a protagonist I can relate to on some level.  However, I kept reading, and as I moved further into this story, I was totally blown away by the twists and turns that Watson managed to weave.  This isn't just a book about a woman who finds out that a person she met online isn't the person she thought he was. There is way more to Second Life than that.As I raced to finish this book, I was totally involved in this story, curious as to how it would be resolved.And the ending does not disappoint.  Second Life is a fantastic psychological thriller that had me eagerly turning pages up until the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0C9LR4RO7YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062060589#wasThisHelpful","R3F0C9LR4RO7YW","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me, North of the Tension Line is a term that makes me think of suspense.  Yet, in a novel by that same name, North of the Tension Line refers to the uppermost tip of Wisconsin's Door County - Washington Island.Fiona moves to Ephraim, Wisconsin, a small town by her city girl standards.  She already feels a little out of her element in this little burg, but is very intrigued by an old home that comes up for sale on Washington Island.  Although Fiona is intrigued, she is also a bit disgusted by the house when she visits. However, a friendly dare from her good friend to spend winter on the island is readily accepted and Fiona sets off for a remote season north of the tension line.North of Tension Line is a slow paced novel, much like small town life, centered more around characters than plot.Riordan also does a fantastic job of describing the setting - so much so that I couldn't help but envision a vacation to Door County myself.This novel won't appeal to those looking for something fast paced, but is well written with likeable and engaging characters, and a look at small town life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NH18ZBXDYJ4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825307341#wasThisHelpful","R3NH18ZBXDYJ4I","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fish in a Tree by Linda Mullaly Hunt was a book that my friend Janice read and then recommended to  me.  I own a copy, which was on my TBR stack, but without her prompting I wouldn't have picked it up for a long time. Maybe years, the way things seem to go.And this book is too good to be kept around for years before reading it. In fact, it is a book that you should read as soon as you have a chance.Ally is smart - quite smart- yet school is a place that she feels lonely and unsuccessful.  Her family moves often since her father is in the military, and after having moved from school to school, she has managed to fool teachers into thinking that her behavior is the result of choices on her part, not because she is covering up for a learning disability.When Mr. Daniels, the substitute teacher who takes over for Ally's teacher who has a baby, Ally tries to fool him, too.  It is a skill she has down pat.And yet, Mr. Daniels is the one teacher that Ally wants to try her hardest for.  With her effort and Mr. Daniels observations and kindness, school is about to change for Ally.Hunt's subplots include her older brother, Travis' problems, and Ally's need to make friends at school, too.This is a story that I can imagine teachers reading aloud to students - a story that kids can enjoy on their own -but one that has so much depth to it, that a read aloud would be a perfect place to discuss people's differences, strengths, and need to feel as though they belong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIHXW0NXILRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162593#wasThisHelpful","RWIHXW0NXILRS","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Francisco Jimenez stole my heart when I read The Circuit, his memoir about his childhood spent as a migrant worker alongside his parents.As I read about in two subsequent memoirs, I continued to root for him, knowing that since he was the author of these memoirs, Jimenez would eventually find success.Now, in Taking Hold Jimenez continues his memoir in a fourth installment.Moving across the country to attend Columbia for graduate school, Francisco  is away from his family and girlfriend for the first time. He encounters a world different from the one he left, yet his work ethic (developed from his days spent as a migrant worker) makes success possible.As years unfold and Jimenez works toward a PhD, he also marries and starts a family of his own.Taking Hold is an important book by a writer with talent who can speak to the Hispanic population of success in this country while overcoming staggering odds.I can hardly wait to follow Jimenez further into his life story, and am awaiting a fifth installment anxiously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XQVZZWQF89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547632304#wasThisHelpful","R18XQVZZWQF89","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From there Zakaria recalls various points in her family's history beginning with their arrival in Pakistan in 1962. Although her family prospered in Pakistan, when Zakaria's uncle builds an upstairs addition on his house so he can marry a second woman, their reputation changes.  Her aunt never approved the second marriage, and returns home to her family, which causes them shame and embarassment.Zakaria's memories of her family and her life made Pakistan come alive.

"Cynthia Hand's novel The Last Time We Say Goodbye was everything I could have wanted in a young adult read.  It is one I will be pressing into the hands of every book lover I know.Lex is trying to come to terms with her brother's suicide.  Just two years younger than her, she and Ty had always been close. Many of her childhood memories are of the two of them together.  As a way of dealing with her grief and trying to move on, Lex is seeing a counselor who wants her to write about her brother and her feelings in a journal.Through the journal and memories, we are able to know Tyler for the sensitive and smart brother Lex has grown up with.  We are also able to understand their family's past, the hurt they still have from their father leaving them, and the way in which this impacted Tyler and Lex.Lex is a brilliant student, looking forward to college and hoping to be accepted to MIT.  Her passion is math, and she loves that this is a subject that follows rules and is predictable.Ever since her brother's death Lex has pushed her friends away. It is clear she blames herself for something that she feels would have made a difference in her brother taking his own life, and has even broken up with her boyfriend, Steven.As the novel unfolds, more is revealed about the day Tyler died, and we can feel Lex's heartbreak and despair when she learns he has killed himself.I so appreciated Hand's note at the novel's end explaining that her own brother had committed suicide when he was seventeen and she was twenty.  The story she has created is fiction, yet the feelings and emotions are so believable because Hand has experience with the loss that Lex experiences.I rarely re-read books, but I would happily read this entire novel again to lose myself in this story and the characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG3RERLT9LXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062318470#wasThisHelpful","RG3RERLT9LXJ","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Molly is asked to cover the story, and although she is still grieving the loss of her own baby who was stillborn, she eagerly takes this chance to further her career.Several people narrate various chapters, and at first the many ways characters were connected with each other was confusing, but it is truly the way small town life works.Sandy is searching for her mother, Jenna, who has disappeared.  Jenna has never been reliable, but after Sandy checks everywhere, she decides to go to the police, risking a possible foster care placement for herself.  When she tells the chief of police, Steve, her mother's name, she can tell by his reaction that there is something he isn't telling her.Barb and Steve have two children, Cole and Hannah.

"Katherine Center's novels are some of my favorite kinds - women's fiction with a few chick lit moments thrown in.Helen, divorced for just a year, and trying to put her life back together, signs up for a wilderness survival course at the suggestion of her younger brother Duncan, who enjoys tormenting his big sister a little.As she sets off, she discovers that her brother's best friend, Jake, is also going on the same survival course.  Helen agrees to give Jake a ride, and she ends up enjoying Jake's company more than she ever imagined.Over the course of the next three weeks, Helen does her best to stay alive, dealing with blisters, elk, and the many other hazards that become part of her daily life.

"Simon is a stay at home dad who has spent the last decade and a half raising his children Laney and Jake.  As the novel opens, a school shooting has occurred, and Simon, like all parents, rushes to the school to make sure his children are alright.  Eventually parents are reunited with their children, or told the devastating news - that their child was killed in the shooting. But Simon remains at the school, still waiting for word about his son.  When he is finally approached by the police it is because they believe Jake had something to do with the shooting.Reardon moves seamlessly between the present and various points in Jake's childhood.  Simon narrates the story, sharing different memories of Jake and his sister when they were younger. He remembers Jake's inability to make friends, his shyness, and compares it to Laney's ease with people.  Simon is desperate to find his son, who is still missing after the shooting, and although he still believes he is innocent, these memories of  Jake make him question if perhaps his son was involved.Other books such as  Defending Jacob by William Landay or Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult have tackled the topic of school shootings, and Bryan Reardon's latest addition to this topic is well written and hard to put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OX9SCL8HVAHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062339486#wasThisHelpful","R2OX9SCL8HVAHB","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All The Rage by Courtney Summers deals with the important subject of rape.  Romy was raped by a golden boy in the small town where she lives. Because of this and who his parents are, the whole crime is swept under the rug. Instead, Romy is ostracized  at school, and is bullied by her other classmates.Although there was some suspense in this novel which kept me quickly turning the pages, Romy's story seemed a bit unbelievable to me.  Although everyone in town seemed to know what had happened to her, her own parents did not.  Romy had a good support system in place with her parents and her friend/boyfriend, Leon, which made it hard to understand the way she acted throughout the novel.When another girl goes missing, Romy must decide if she will step forward and speak up.  Although Romy had been friends with Peggy the two are no longer close, yet Romy's lack of concern about this classmate seems a bit far-fetched.Overall, All The Rage is not a bad novel. Her writing is easy to read, and her characters are complex.  I will be looking for more from this author, even though this novel was not all I hoped for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PITLMPNAQ68D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125002191X#wasThisHelpful","R2PITLMPNAQ68D","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More Love, Less Panic: 7 Lessons I Learned About Life, Love and Parenting After We Adopted Our Son From Ethiopia is a must read for parents.Initially I was interested in this book because I love adoption stories. My brother is adopted from El Salvador and his addition to our family is one of the happiest memories of my childhood.  Yet, Knobler doesn't just write about things that will pertain to parents of adopted children.  I found his lessons very applicable to my own parenting.Each chapter focuses on something Knobler learned about parenting because of the addition of Nati, the child he and his wife adopted from Ethiopia. Yet, I could find myself in these lessons with my own biological children.In one lesson Knobler writes about wanting to change Nati, to trade in his exuberance and joy for some of Knobler's own Jewish worry.  Until he realized that he should appreciate Nati for who he is, not try to change him into what he is not.  Learning that lesson has helped Knobler enjoy Nati and delight in his son's happiness.  What a good lesson for all parents - me included!Nati was five years old when he was adopted, and had to say goodbye to his biological parents.  Knobler met Nati's mother briefly, but his father had already died after becoming sick from a blood transfusion.  I believe that every single day Knobler realizes the enormity of what these people gave up and can appreciate the role he now plays in Nati's life.Reading this book, I took away more than seven lessons.  Knobler's underlying theme about the importance of parenting and shaping a life are front and center from beginning to end.When things start to get a little hairy at home, when I'm feeling impatient and am short with my children, I hope I remember to reach for More Love, Less Panic and remind myself what is really important in parenting my children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19JDO4C3I0JK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167951#wasThisHelpful","R19JDO4C3I0JK7","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ari and her brother Gage are being raised by their mother's friend, Janna.  Ari doesn't even remember her father, a soldier, who died in combat, and her mother died when she was in second grade.  Her mom asks Janna, a high school friend, to raise her children.  However, Gage and Janna have always butted heads.  So Gage decides to move out and take Ari with him, because one of their mother's final wishes was that the two remain together.Gage and Janna have nowhere to go when they leave Janna's, which they don't tell anyone.  The two move between friends' homes, sleeping on couches, floors, and every once in a while spend the night in a homeless shelter.Ari is finding it difficult to get her schoolwork done, her hair is greasy, and her clothing stained. Yet, she attempts to keep up appearances, not wanting anyone to know what is really going on in her life.  Her best friend seems to be finding other girls to hang out with, and Ari's application to a prestigious middle school is due soon, and Ari is under pressure to be admitted and honor another of her mother's wishes.Jacobson's novel had me sucked in from the first page. As I read I became anxious myself for Ari and Gage who had so much stacked against them.  With each day they remained homeless, and with more obstacles standing in their way, I wanted to reach out and help the two myself.For all the tween readers who think the problem of homelessness is something that can be easily solved, Jacobson does a great job of sharing the many steps that Gage needed to go through in order to secure a home for him and his sister.Ari continues to dream of having a home, hanging on to her paper things, a folder of people and things she has cut from catalogs in order to create the perfect family and home, something she longs for.The resolution to Paper Things left me satisfied and longing to press this book into students' hands.  This is a must read for tween and middle grade students.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RE23BVUSG84C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663239#wasThisHelpful","R2RE23BVUSG84C","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read Lori Lansens work before, and enjoy her writing.  I was anxious to see another novel from her.Early press releases liken The Mountain Story to Wild by Cheryl Strayed or Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer. I have read both of these books, yet didn't feel that The Mountain Story really compared to either.The novel begins by sharing a letter from Wolf, who is writing to his son years after he and three women are stranded on a mountain.  There were parts of their time on the mountain that were suspenseful and I wanted to know who would make it off the mountain, yet there were also parts that seemed to drag on.Since Wolf's story was the focus of this novel, the plot moved slowly from time to time.  This is still an enjoyable novel, and one that people who like adventure stories and the outdoors will want to check out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F62P4AWVHME2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147678650X#wasThisHelpful","R2F62P4AWVHME2","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jo Knowles books are usually ones I am still talking about long after I have finished the last page. Read Between the Lines is definitely one of those books, but for different reasons than the others I've read by Knowles.Each chapter focuses on a different person, and although this took me some time to get into, I appreciated how these people appeared in the lives of other characters in other chapters.And as each chapter is told, it is easy to see that there is more to each person than what others are seeing. The central theme ""read between the lines"" begins in the first chapter as Nate's middle finger is broken in gym class and he is essentially giving people the finger as his middle finger is swollen and permanently raised.  The ""read between the lines"" theme continues throughout, making an appearance in each character's story, ending with Ms. Lindsey in the last chapter, a teacher who realizes she must read between the lines and look for what she isn't seeing right away in each of her students.There were parts of Read Between the Lines that I really enjoyed - especially the way Knowles managed to interweave the characters and show how their lives and decisions affected each other.  But, it was hard for me to connect with every character, and often once I did, it was time to move to the next chapter when a new character was the focus.Still, despite that drawback, Knowles writing is wonderful, and her book will provide a lot for readers to think about.  This one is a title intended for an older audience - high school, I think - and might make a good novel for a lit. class to read and discuss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUOI4E1JK36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663875#wasThisHelpful","R1BUOI4E1JK36","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bookseller is Cynthia Swanson's debut novel and a story I found myself entirely sucked into.It is 1962 and Kitty and her friend Freda are running their own bookstore in Denver, Colorado.  Kitty would have enjoyed being married and having children, but a long term boyfriend never led to marriage, and after being stood up on a blind date, she chose to live a life of solitude.However, when Kitty falls asleep she often wakes up in 1963 as Katharyn, where she is the mother to triplets and is happily married to Lars (who coincidentally is the man who never showed up for their date in 1954).  This dream life is taking its toll on Kitty as she becomes more enmeshed in what is going on in it.  When she returns to 1962 she tries to locate her house, Lars' sister, and other things that might solve some of the mystery.I'm not a big fantasy reader, but the time travel in this book was very intriguing and I enjoyed each time period as I tried to determine how this would all come together in the end. Sometimes one time period is more appealing than another, but perhaps because Kitty was the protagonist in both.The other thing that I felt was very well done was the 1963 setting.  Swanson was an expert at creating a very realistic time period.  I found myself being impressed with many little details. At one point Kitty (in 1962) asks who is the president.  Of course the answer was Kennedy.  In my mind I was then able to determine that she was somewhere in 1963 prior to his assassination. But, Swanson expertly had Kitty realize that her question didn't reveal much since Kennedy was indeed the president in 1963 and since no one anticipated his death, the setting could have been 1964, or even 1968 if he had been re-elected.Up until the very end I was not sure how Swanson would weave these two time periods and stories together.  As Kitty spends a lot of time in 1963, memories are revealed and other bits of the story which helps bring things to a satisfying conclusion.Swanson's debut novel was absolutely delightful and a book I will be recommending to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7PHCSB4V2YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333003#wasThisHelpful","R1U7PHCSB4V2YS","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Question of Miracles is Elana K. Arnold's first middle grade novel and I was absolutely blown away by it. This novel explores the question of loss in a way that kids (and adults) will easily relate to.Iris and her parents have moved to Oregon where it seems to rain all the time. In addition to disliking the dreary weather, Iris doesn't yet have any friends in her new home.Then she meets Boris, a boy in her class that is also in need of some friends. Despite Boris' annoying habits, the two become friends.During all of this Iris is dealing with the death of her best friend, Sarah.  Arnold creates a little suspense as the reason for Sarah's death isn't initially revealed. But most important, she allows Iris to explore the question of miracles.  Boris survived what was to have been a fatal birth defect; his life is a miracle. Yet, Sarah died, and Iris struggles to understand why she didn't receive a miracle.These are complex thoughts - ones that adults question as well, and Arnold does an amazing job of answering this question and allowing Iris to find some happiness without her best friend.I'd love to press this book into my tween daughters' hands along with my upper elementary students and teachers.  The Question of Miracles is an amazing book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA5UVZJR8JSMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544334647#wasThisHelpful","RA5UVZJR8JSMN","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"JJ has always wanted to work in the music business. However, her family is a family of lawyers, and that is what is expected of her.When JJ gets a job with a record company for the summer, her parents allow her to take the job, with the stipulation that if she chooses to continue in the biz, she be able to get a contract before the summer is up.That is nearly impossible, of course, but it is made even more so by the fact that JJ is busy investigating the suicide of Dulcie Brown, a down on her luck singer that JJ meets at the Brill Building where she works.Turns out there are a lot of things going on in the Brill Building that JJ learn about rather quickly. The filing and copying she does for her job are just a small portion of what her days entail.There is Luke Silver who JJ meets and then learns that his father and her uncle Bernie were partners.  Bernie has an office in the Brill Building as well, and JJ is finally given the opportunity to meet this family member she has never known.When Dulcie dies it is immediately ruled a suicide, but JJ is certain Dulcie has much to live for.  She and Luke begin poking around a little on their own, searching for what happened the night of Dulcie's death.Weil's novel is set in the 60s, a time period I love reading about, and one that she describes well as various newspaper headlines are shared, music is discussed and clothing is described.I also enjoyed Weil's subtle humor. For example, her reference to song titles that have not yet been written, but that were later hits.  At one point JJ makes mention that That's What Friends Are For sounds like a song title, which the office manager Rona quickly dismisses.My tween daughter is reading this novel, quickly grabbing it from me as I closed the cover.  Although this is written for a tween/young adult audience, I enjoyed this novel as well.  I am hoping that we see more of JJ in the future and that Weil will continue to write more about these characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLRXBBW6U029/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161695356X#wasThisHelpful","R1OLRXBBW6U029","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sisters Rachel and Drew Snow have never been close. Rachel was kicked out of the house when she was just sixteen, and Drew was only twelve.  Over twenty years later she is happily married, living a suburban housewife's life. Despite her rough teenage years, her life has always seemed easy to her younger sister.Drew has always felt a bit inferior to Rachel. Her life seems so put together, while Drew is struggling to make ends by using her musical talent to make a living.Rachel narrates much of the story, which centers around the sisters reuniting to deal with their mother's dementia.  When their mother tells them about a book she owns, the sisters retrieve it from their childhood home and take it to a Japanese translator.What he translates is a story about a female samurai.  This story causes Rachel and Drew to wonder a bit more about their mother's life before she came to America from Japan.Dilloway's novel is complex. In addition to Rachel's narration, alternating chapters are set in the twelfth century, providing the story of Tomoe, a samurai in long ago Japan.The sisters relationship is a focus of this story, but their own problems - with children, dating, and finding themselves are also explored.  In addition, Rachel reveals a great deal about her past and her father which explains a lot about Drew and Rachel.Although I was not entirely engaged in samurai story, Dilloway does a good job of creating this thread that develops throughout the novel and tying it in with Rachel and Drew's mother's past.This is the third novel I have read by Dilloway; each one is a story I have enjoyed and become engaged with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287F96JTGM5KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170804#wasThisHelpful","R287F96JTGM5KB","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Midwife of Hope River by Patricia Harman is a novel that has stayed with me long after I read the last page.  Not only did the story stick with me, but it also reaffirmed my belief that there are really great books being written all the time that just don't get the publicity or awards they deserve.I was overjoyed to see that The Reluctant Midwife by Patricia Harman is another novel continuing along the same lines as Harman's first.This novel focuses more on Nurse Becky and the doctor she once worked for, Dr. Blum, who are attempting to make a living for themselves during the Great Depression.  With nowhere to turn, they head back to West Virginia where they reunite with Patience Hester, the midwife featured so prominently in The Midwife of Hope River.Dr. Blum has been living in a catatonic state after the death of his wife in an automobile accident and the death of a patient on whom he operated on the same day.  Since that time, he hasn't spoke a word, and Becky has cared for him - feeding him, brushing his teeth, dressing him.Although the economy in West Virginia is even worse than in other parts of the country, Patience and her veterinarian husband Daniel Hester befriend these two and they are able to eke out their existence.All the while Nurse Becky finds herself (reluctantly) assisting Patience with deliveries, and eventually taking over her practice when Patience is put on bed rest.I loved the Great Depression setting, and was especially intrigued by the Civilian Conservation Corp where Becky eventually found nursing work.  The cast of characters Harman created that comprised the small West Virginia town were interesting and realistic. And as in The Midwife of Hope River the accounts of Patience and Becky's deliveries were well explained and detailed.Now that I've read The Reluctant Midwife, I have even more hope that this will not be the last novel about Patience and Becky and their midwifery practice.  The Reluctant Midwife is another wonderful novel that book clubs should be busy discussing and women's fiction fans will enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWEHD045BUTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062358243#wasThisHelpful","R2IWEHD045BUTU","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One Step Too Far reminds me a bit of Before I Go To Sleep, a rather quiet thriller based mostly on events in someone's own mind.As the novel begins Emily Coleman awakes one morning, take a few of her things, and leaves her family behind, starting a new life for herself.Through flashbacks and the viewpoint of various people in Emily's life bits and pieces are revealed about Emily's past: her childhood, courtship with her husband Ben, tense relationship with her troubled identical twin sister, all giving a greater view of Emily. Yet, there is still something that isn't revealed until nearer the end.Meanwhile, Emily's new life involves renting a bedroom in a house, getting a job as a receptionist and beginning to use drugs - a far cry from the beautiful life she left.The big question, what happened that caused Emily to leave?I can't say I was surprised by the novel's outcome, but I was totally sucked in to the story and wanted to know more about Emily and how her mind worked.  At the novel's beginning I had to have some uninterrupted reading time so I could really get into the story especially as the narrator changed and I was just figuring out who everyone was. However, I spent my afternoon curled up with this book, unable to put it down.I can't wait to hear more from Seskis.

"I fell in love with Don in The Rosie Project as he analytically went about finding himself a wife.  As someone who clearly is on the autism spectrum, there are many unique aspects to the way Don went about this task, but alas, finally realized that love is not something that can be calculated or rationally explained.Now, in the Rosie Effect, Don and Rosie have moved to New York, and Rosie is pregnant.  The impending birth of an infant sends Don into high gear as he tries to take charge of Rosie and her diet and exercise in order to give their unborn child, Bud, the best start possible.Of course, the way Don goes about this is quite comical, until he is arrested for watching young children in a park as the police mistake him for a pedophile.  More confusion follows as Don tries to keep this from Rosie, who must keep her stress level down in order to provide the best environment for their unborn child.  The secrets mount as the issue leads from one thing to another, adding to the humor in The Rosie Effect.I was so excited to see that The Rosie Project had a sequel coming out.  And The Rosie Effect is quite entertaining, although didn't quite live up to my expectations.  Perhaps I set the bar too high after falling in love with the first novel, but I could see additional novels featuring Don and Rosie in the future, a la The Shopaholic novels by Sophie Kinsella.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166FOQV3WLUBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476767319#wasThisHelpful","R166FOQV3WLUBY","A3V5KBIS9TWUVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V5KBIS9TWUVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.And so the end takes us to the beginning. Poughkeepsie Begins will be a delightfully heart wrenching treat for series fans. Getting to see the boys during their final year in foster care and high school and only some of what they endured to become the men we fell in love with as the Poughkeepsie Brotherhood was forged in blood and pain made me fall in love with them all over again. After Anastasia made me cry, more than once, while reading Saving Poughkeepsie, I shouldnâ€™t have been surprised that I finished this book with a stuffy nose, puffy eyes, and a book hangover that shouldnâ€™t have been possible after only 200 pages â€“ and yet here I sit, sniveling as I try to convey just how moving this book was for me.I am all about the journey in a book â€“ how the characters get from point A to point B. Knowing that a couple will end up together at the end doesnâ€™t ruin the story for me â€“ heck, itâ€™s why I read mostly romance. And Poughkeepsie Begins was all about the journey for me and I expect it will be the same for a lot of readers. It didnâ€™t matter that I was already aware of some of the events within or where the events would eventually lead the guys. What mattered was seeing the events play out. Anastasia proved that knowing that something happened is entirely different than seeing it actually play out â€“ hence the tears.Although much of the book seemed to focus on Beckett and his final taste of the light before embracing the dark side of Poughkeepsie, Cole was the dark horse for me. Iâ€™m not sure if I was so enamored by Blake and charmed by Beckett that I missed it or if Iâ€™m just failing to remember the manâ€™s secrets as they were learned in the rest of the series, but I was shocked by the secrets that were revealed about Cole and the depths to which he could sink and what he was capable of when he â€œturned offâ€ in a situation. But as itâ€™s said, itâ€™s always the quiet ones and perhaps I was so dazzled by Blake and Beckett that I overlooked the faithful Cole. After reading this book, I understood fully why Cole turned to God the way he did and am utterly astounded that he was able to do so after his rescue. Regardless of why I missed him before, I cannot wait to read the series in a full run as I know that I will be seeing Cole in a whole new light.For those readers who are new to the series, I canâ€™t even imagine what your emotions will be like as you read Poughkeepsie Begins. I may have forgotten bits and pieces of the individual books, but the series as a whole has stuck with me and there is so much that I canâ€™t un-know that makes it impossible for me to put myself in your shoes as you meet Beckett, Blake, and Cole for the first time as young men. I would suggest that once youâ€™ve read the series in its entirety that you reread this installment because I expect that you will have an entirely different experience reading it the second time. Anastasiaâ€™s talent simply amazes me as she can write some seriously raunchy comedy (her Gynazule series) as well as a series that has ripped my heart out time and time again with each book of the Poughkeepsie Brotherhood as I fell in love with the brothers and the family they created. As sad as I am that this marks the end of the series, I am glad that the author gave us this final opportunity to visit Poughkeepsie again and I cannot wait until I get a chance to reread the series as a whole â€“ even if Iâ€™ll need a fresh box of tissues when I do.Thank you Debra Anastasia, for telling me a story.~ Wicked Reads Review Team ~","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VY8ZHHAPV8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017RNBRRM#wasThisHelpful","R21VY8ZHHAPV8U","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received my Ecandy Bluetooth 4.0 Earbuds last night, so this is my early review. Normally I would wait to post a review until I had used the product for a while, but I haven't been diligent at that as of late so I wanted to at least leave my initial impressions of the product. Hence the 4-stars rather than 5-stars at this time.I am a voracious reader and book blogger and am never too far from my Kindle. Lately, however, I have had more to do than I've had time to do it in so I've been using the text-to-speech function on my Kindle Fire to listen to some of the novels I've been reviewing. But because of noise and other factors, I'm not always able to do so and for the past two months I have been trying to find one of the dozens of pairs of earbuds I own but can never seem to find when I need them. I finally resigned myself to buying yet another set and decided to see if I could find a set of Bluetooth earbuds that were compatible with my Kindle Fire. While in theory we know that Bluetooth-enabled devices should work together, anyone who owns a Kindle knows that our best friend doesn't always play well with others. On a couple of other product pages, I made the mistake of asking if the earbuds worked with the Kindle Fire and I received the well-intentioned answer that they were compatible with all Bluetooth devices. What I should have asked was if anyone had actually used the earbuds with a Fire. THEN I found the product page for this set of Ecandy earbuds and someone had asked the correct Kindle question and another customer confirmed that they had indeed used them with their Kindle Fire. So based on that, I decided to purchase this set of earbuds.Upon opening the box and reading the instructions (yes I actually do that), I attached the earbuds to my laptop via the included USB-charging cable to fully charge the earbuds as recommended. Less than 2 hours later, I followed the instructions and paired the earbuds to my Kindle Fire. The most difficult steps in doing this were actually remembering where on the Fire's menu the Bluetooth pairing page was AND holding the earbud's pairing button down correctly. Because the pairing button is the main function button, it doesn't respond to a single touch and I had to figure out how to hold it properly to actually activate the button. While initially annoying, this is actually a good design feature that will keep you from accidentally triggering different functions.Once I paired the earbuds to my Kindle, I used them for an hour or two last night just to get a feel for them. I have to say that the way they fit inside my ear canal turned out to be far more comfortable than I expected them to be upon seeing them. This also helped block out my dog's whining, but did not prevent me from hearing her barking - an important distinction in my household because the whining is usually a sign that she wants something but is being too lazy to get it herself, whereas the barking means I need to stop what I'm doing to see what's going on. I did have a little trouble turning the headphones off at first, but it again this was the design feature that required that I hold them just right.This morning I decided to try them out again while I did some housework. I turned the earbuds on with little effort (because I'm finally figuring out how best to hold them to use the main function button), turned on my Fire's Bluetooth feature, popped them in, and got started on my cleaning. I live in a small two-room apartment so my kitchen/living room area is one room so I set my Kindle down in a central location and moved about the apartment without any interruption in the book I was listening to. For once, I was able to wash dishes and hear my book without issue and I loved that. I HATE washing dishes, but being able to listen to my book and not having to strain to hear it over running water made the task go much faster than usual. I actually got some housework done AND got to listen to my book and I am just tickled pink about this. In fact, I forgot that I had the earbuds in and walked to my bedroom without bringing my Fire and didn't lose connectivity.The true test for me will be when I take the earbuds to work and see how well they work there. I am fortunate that my job is such that I'm able to read at times while at work, so I'm anxious to see how well the earbuds work in that setting as there are many times when I could listen to my book and work at the same time if the regular environmental noises weren't so loud.I should note that the only negative I have encountered is that the magnetic properties mentioned in the product description are so slight that I thought I had read it on another earbud's product page. So if you're hoping to rely upon the magnetic properties to secure the earbuds around your neck while not in use, don't because it's not that strong.My initial impression of this set of earbuds is quite positive. I will endeavor to update my review after a month or two of use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R329QXH8X4X615/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUGH4PM#wasThisHelpful","R329QXH8X4X615","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.I have a confession to make. When the blog tour invite for Reckless hit the blogâ€™s inbox, I pulled rank and signed up for it for myself. Since Iâ€™ve been reviewing for blogs for the last two years, I havenâ€™t had a chance to read a Nicole Edwards book. Suffice it to say, I was ecstatic when I saw the email and when I saw that we could only have one reviewer, I had a Gollum moment â€œMy precious!â€ While I feel a little bad that I didnâ€™t allow one of the other reviewers on the team a chance to review it (you know, I really donâ€™t â€“ Iâ€™m just saying that because I should), I am so glad that my greed got the best of me because I freaking loved Reckless.Thereâ€™s a line in the book that sums up the chemistry between Cam and Gannon perfectly. â€œThe kiss went from inferno to apocalyptic in a matter of seconds, sending Cam spiraling out of control.â€ To say the passion and emotions throughout most of Reckless are intense is putting it mildly. When Gannonâ€™s assistant Molly drags him into Pier 70 to reserve a boat for a company outing, the sparks of attraction between him and Cam are instantaneous. That Edwards has penned two characters whose personal baggage is exacerbated by the otherâ€™s lifestyle so fully while making it believable is impressive. Even better is that neither man is aware of it until itâ€™s too late because by the time the triggers are pulled, the men are too invested one another. I loved watching Cam and Gannon fall for one another and even though it actually occurs over a relatively short amount of time, the author crafts the tale in such a way that it doesnâ€™t feel like theyâ€™re moving too fast. In fact, it wasnâ€™t until one of the characters would point out how little time had passed that I was aware of it; otherwise, it felt like the relationship developed over more time than it actually did. The foundation for the drama that threatens their relationship is laid out early in the book so that when the obstacles appear, their presence felt both inevitable and natural for Cam and Gannon to have to face in their relationship. The fallout was devastating to both men (and me) and I honestly wasnâ€™t sure how Edwards was going to bring the men back together for their happy ending â€“ and no, thatâ€™s not a spoiler because itâ€™s why most of us read romance after all. Yet she did and I must say that itâ€™s a shame there arenâ€™t more Mollys in the world because everyone deserves someone like her in their corner.In addition to watching Cam and Gannon find their way, Reckless lays the foundation for the series and gives us a good look into Pier 70 and the men that are like family to Cam. Roan, Dare, Teague, and Hudson make up the other part of the Pier 70 crew and watching them interact with Cam and one another makes me really glad that this is only the first book in the series because I cannot wait to see them each find the man that makes their lives complete â€“ or claim the man that will make them whole as I suspect two of them may be destined for one another (but that could be wishful thinking on my part). While I truly adored Molly and Dare for stepping in when they each needed to in order to save their friends even more heartache, it was Camâ€™s father who really pulled my heartstrings (that is, when Cam and Gannon werenâ€™t busy doing it themselves). Michael Stricklandâ€™s unconditional love and support of his son was perfection â€“ it was not a matter of accepting that his son was gay, it was simply a matter of doing the job he felt every parent was meant to do for their children, loving their child regardless. I nearly cried when he told Gannon that, and that Cam was right about Gannon being good enough for him. Yet another character the world needs more of. Reckless has the Pier 70 series off to a wonderful start and I cannot wait to read the next one â€¦ and the one after that â€¦ and the one after that.~ Wicked Reads Review Team ~","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKOILM58CVMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DQEFE2#wasThisHelpful","R3RKOILM58CVMM","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cothern is one of THOSE authors. We all have them. The authors whose books we cannot get enough of. The authors who when Iâ€™m asked if I want to review their latest book I donâ€™t even bother to ask what itâ€™s about or when itâ€™s due (because I will give up sleep to read it). The authors whose writing pulls you so fully into the story that youâ€™re perturbed when you have to return to your dull and boring life (at least compared to their charactersâ€™ it is). You know, THOSE authors. The latest novel from Cothernâ€™s Guns & Hoses series was no exception as I found myself so completely wrapped up in Austin and Lukasâ€™s lives that I stayed up way too late to finish Fire & Ice.For those who have read Guns & Hoses, you will be delighted to know that we get to catch up with Tig and Flame as Austin is Flameâ€™s cousin and he is trying to get a job as an arson investigator in Tampa. While Austin is more than happy to stay with his cousin as heâ€™s always looked up to him and credits him for making his high school years survivable, Austin finds it hard to tolerate Flameâ€™s heavy handedness when Flameâ€™s protective instincts are triggered. And it turns out that Austinâ€™s new partner Lukas sets off all of Flameâ€™s protective instincts. Fortunately, Austin is more than willing to tell his cousin to back off and mind his own business, even if heâ€™s not willing to share his biggest secret with his cousin. But Flame isnâ€™t the only person Austin is keeping secrets from and I found his deception with Lukas rather entertaining. Normally I wouldnâ€™t consider Austinâ€™s deception appropriate, but Cothern makes it work because Austinâ€™s intentions are good and not coming from a place of malice. That didnâ€™t keep me from worrying about the fallout that was sure to accompany his secret being exposed, but the author does something that was so unexpected that the fallout was practically nil.I loved almost everything about Fire & Ice and Iâ€™ll get to the teensy weensy issue that I didnâ€™t enjoy momentarily. The chemistry between Austin and Lukas is intense, but Lukas spends so much time fighting against it that when they do connect it is explosive. And itâ€™s even more intense when they scene together. The BDSM scenes are off-the-charts hot. I seriously enjoyed that it took Lukas so long to figure out Austinâ€™s secret and that it was his denial of his attraction to Austin that kept him from seeing what was right in front of him. I loved the serial arson investigation that Cothern included in the book. It not only elevated the novelâ€™s level of realism, but it also provided Austin opportunities he needed to prove his mettle as an investigator. But the arson investigation also brought in the teeny tiny part of the story I didnâ€™t enjoy. Cothern does such a good job of bringing in the FBI and utilizing their reputation for taking over local cases that I was a little let down with how that scenario played out. For once, it was more realism than I wanted simply because I wanted to see Lukas and Austin break the case. But thatâ€™s just me pouting and it wasnâ€™t enough of an issue to reduce my rating because I loved the way Fire & Ice played out in the end. I cannot wait to see what Cothern has in store next for the Guns & Hoses series.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3122A38T32T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSRJRUA#wasThisHelpful","R2F3122A38T32T","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the end of The Hob, King Oberon was shown wandering, lost because his memory was gone. That was a terrible way for the author to leave fans of the series hanging. Outright cruel. Needless to say, I am glad that I had The Siren's Song loaded on my Kindle and on my review schedule so I didn't have to wait long to find out what Oberon's fate was and whether or not he would accept his mate.Having first met Cassie in Artistic Vision and then getting to know her a bit more in The Hob, it was obvious that hers was a pure and honest soul. As one of the merfolk, she uses her sirenâ€™s song to heal others and yet her own safety was in danger one she fled Atlantis up avoid an unwanted arranged marriage. Yet despite the risk to her safety and freedom, she takes off in pursuit of Oberon once his absence has been detected. Having been forewarned by Shane as to the condition she would find him in, Cassie knew that her skills would be needed to restore his memory. Because of the kind of person Cassie is, she is cautious as to the information she reveals during their time together because she does not wish to unduly influence Oberon. This proves to be a wise choice on her part because as Oberon's memory returns and he comes to realize how she could have taken advantage of his situation, his love for her grows. Oh yes, I said love. As it turns out, Oberon's memory loss ends up being a boon as he got to know Cassie without the memory of Titannia's betrayal coloring their fledgling relationship.One of the things I enjoy about Bell's writing and this series is that while there is a series thread that is running from book to book, each book is written in such a way that it can be enjoyed as a standalone. While this does good true for The Siren's Song as well, this particular installment will be more enjoyable if the prior books in the series are read first, but at the very least The Hob should be read. Despite how distressing his memory loss was, I found the developing relationship between Oberon and Cassie to be quite heartwarming. Cassie did all that she could to heal Oberon fully expecting her truebond to send her away once his memory was restored. So when his memory returns and he sets out to claim his queen, Cassie is happier than she ever expected to be. At the same time as their bond is being formed, Robin and his Blades are busy uncovering who was responsible for Oberon's condition to begin with. I definitely understood his reaction to the identity of those involved and seriously enjoyed the way he and Robin dispensed punishment. But my favorite part was the formal bonding ceremony and I look forward to seeing Queen Cassandra show the doubters that she is truly Oberon's partner and truebond mate.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4YEDNV5FJ26Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3XTSWS#wasThisHelpful","R4YEDNV5FJ26Q","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having laughed my butt off while reading Pucked (and why canâ€™t that be literally?), I dove at the chance to read Pucked Up. Let me first assure those that have not read Pucked that you absolutely can read Pucked Up as a stand-alone book, but you are seriously shortchanging yourself on the experience that is Vi, Alex, and the MC. Those who read Pucked will be delighted to know that Vi and her filter-less mouth make many appearances in this installment as she is Buckâ€™s step-sister after all. And while the humor is certainly rampant within this book, I was surprised by how much the humor was toned down from book one considering that Buck is a guy and all. But it worked because Hunting revealed Buckâ€™s character in such a way that I realized that I was just as guilty of misjudging him as so many of the people around him were â€“ and I even knew how good of a brother he was to Vi. Yep, I fell in love with the yeti!Where Pucked was a romantic comedy featuring the borderline adolescent sense of humor of Vi, Pucked Up is more a comedy of errors with a sprinkling of adolescent humor. If there was a way for a situation to go wrong and lead to Buck looking like a manwhore on social media, it happened. Rather than the incidents feeling contrived as a way to add humor to the book, they felt like naturally occurring misfires as they were rarely situations of Buckâ€™s making. The charity carwash is a perfect example of this because Buck went to the event with two very admirable goals and found himself plastered all over social media â€“ again â€“ in what looked to be a compromising situation when it wasnâ€™t. Buck is one of those guys who can actually say â€œItâ€™s not what it looks likeâ€ and it be completely true. He was also far deeper of a character than I would have ever expected from reading book one. His feelings for Sunny were genuine and made him want to be a better man. While their sexy fun times were seriously hot, I found the romance between Sunny and Buck to be far sweeter than I ever expected. And I loved it.As much as I liked Sunny and felt badly for her when she messed up, she messed up HUGE because she let people close to her who didnâ€™t know Buck and the relationship they had try to tell her what to think of him. That said, I loved it when she stood up to Alex and let him know that she wasnâ€™t going to let him tell her what to think. But Hunting didnâ€™t stop there with clearing the air because more than one person took the time to â€œman upâ€ in this book and apologize for jumping to conclusions about Buck and what they assumed was going on. Human nature often leads to a level of immaturity when peoplesâ€™ feelings are hurt, causing them to lash out, but I liked how Huntingâ€™s characters showed growth by owning up to what they did wrong and apologizing for it. Itâ€™s not something you see in a lot of romances, especially the new adult genre, so it was quite refreshing. Pucked Up was â€œincrawsomeâ€ and I really hope that Hunting plans to continue the series as I love this group of friends and would love to revisit them â€¦ and find out what went down between Lily and Randy.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RSR9E8K8NZD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OR83AG#wasThisHelpful","R3RSR9E8K8NZD7","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this is not the first time Iâ€™ve read Dare to Believe, it has been a LONG time since I last read it and as I reread it, I was actually annoyed with myself for not having returned to The Gray Court sooner as the Dunnes and the world they live in is quite magical â€“ and not just because theyâ€™re fae. As the first book in the series, the author does a wonderful job of introducing the various parts of the fae world the Dunnes are a part of and weaving it into Leo and Rubyâ€™s story in such a way that the reader learns about Leoâ€™s life at the same time Ruby does. For me, this helped me to connect with Ruby â€“ that and the fact that she has a killer sense of humor.Unbeknownst to her, our dear sweet frumpy Ruby captured Leoâ€™s attention almost immediately. Because she considers herself unattractive, she has avoided being in Leoâ€™s presence for fear of her attraction to him becoming public knowledge and the subsequent humiliation she knows will follow â€“ after all, no one as attractive and accomplished as Leo Dunne could possibly be attracted to the short, fat girl. But Leo is determined to prove what he already knows â€“ that Ruby is the one woman the universe made for him. The five years of (not so) unrequited love and the fated mates aspect made the way in which their relationship progressed feel right. Rubyâ€™s feeling that she was rushing headlong into heartbreak had more to do with personal insecurities than Leo himself. The built-in history allowed the author to move the story forward â€“ from a hot night of sex and seduction straight into the kidnapping of Leoâ€™s brother Shane. Although not ideal circumstances for meeting her future in-laws (even if Ruby didnâ€™t know that at the time), Leoâ€™s parents were very welcoming of Ruby and approving of her as Leoâ€™s mate. Yet the story is just getting started and soon all hell breaks loose as those responsible for Shaneâ€™s kidnapping demand their ransom â€“ Leoâ€™s hand in marriage â€“ and their attempt to remove Ruby as an obstacle leads to quite the explosive bonding as Leo claims his mate in no uncertain terms. Not willing to let something as trivial as a truebond waylay their plans, the kidnappers step up their plans and Leo finds himself tapping into his Leprechaun bloodline to save the day.One of the things that still impresses me about this book is the way that Bell utilizes the ongoing storyline to teach the reader about the Fae Courts, introduce the cast of characters, and set the stage for future books in the series. There is a lot of information introduced as the author builds the world in which the series is set, yet it is done in such a way that the reader is not overwhelmed with the info â€“ at least I wasnâ€™t. As I have read the first three books more than once, I found humor in statements made that foreshadowed future plot lines that werenâ€™t humorous during the first read because I wasnâ€™t privy to the direction the author was taking the series. Bell combines intriguing characters, fast-paced action, steamy sex scenes, and a sweet romance in Dare to Believe and managed to hook me so thoroughly that I bought and read books two and three immediately and Iâ€™m looking forward to rereading them next.I reviewed my personal copy of this book.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGEPSPHGDNI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I1XQ1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1YGEPSPHGDNI1","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whirlwind was a fun and sexy way to round out the Southern Spirits series. I donâ€™t know that the author has ended the series officially, but as itâ€™s been a couple of years since this installmentâ€™s original release and no new characters were introduced as potential leading men, Iâ€™m assuming this is the final book in the series and I must say that Bradford certainly went out with a blast. After Conner found love in Ascension, it was only fitting that our other long-term and interactive spirit, Stefan, find his happiness in the ever after. And Stefanâ€™s tale reads like the best case of karma ever.In life, Stefan was born with brain damage that resulted in him having both mental and physical delays. In Aftermath we learned that his condition contributed to his being murdered because he fell prey to a high school bully who used him sexually and then tricked him into going to the place of his murder. However, in death, Stefan was no longer afflicted as his limitation had been physical and the lack of a corporeal body equated a â€œnormalâ€ existence in the spirit world. This â€œnewâ€ and â€œimprovedâ€ Stefan made for an extremely entertaining first encounter with Jordan and Gideon, two recently deceased soldiers who traveled to McKinton to be near Jordanâ€™s mother. Once the three men deal with their initial misunderstanding and spend a little time together, the sparks fly and Stefan finds himself in the best place possible â€“ between Jordan and Gideon. But when Jordanâ€™s mom lets out a secret that sends Jordan into hiding out of fear from the fallout, Stefan once again finds himself alone and on the outside looking in. The knowledge of what heâ€™s missing out on leads Stefan to make some rather poor choices that have him questioning if there are indeed things worse than death and heartbreak. Fortunately for Stefan, the most important men in his death are well trained and adore him, and have no qualms about putting themselves between Stefan and the danger heâ€™s courting.I absolutely loved this installment. Itâ€™s no secret that a well written mÃ©nage is one of my favorite types of relationships to read about and Bradford did a wonderful job creating a fledgling relationship between Jordan, Gideon and Stefan and then building upon it. There is some serious heat among this trio and their ability to ignore the laws of physics made for some scorchingly hot sex scenes. I also enjoyed how she handled Stefanâ€™s disability and the explanation for his life and death differences seemed quite feasible. Connerâ€™s continued presence as a protector in Stefanâ€™s life was perfect and made sense as Conner always saw Stefan as a kid due to his age at death, and not his disability because Conner didnâ€™t know Stefan when he was alive. Whirlwind was an extremely enjoyable read and as much as I hate to see the end of the series, I like how the author brought it to a resolution with all of the main players having their stories told. Fortunately for me, Bradford has many, many other series for me to read.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8OYDX4M9GOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XW3X0I#wasThisHelpful","R2W8OYDX4M9GOJ","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of these days Iâ€™m going to set down and read this series from the beginning, back-to-back, so I know which of the good guys Iâ€™m grieving for. Yes, thatâ€™s a tiny bit of a spoiler, but with the ongoing war between the Shadow Shifters and the rogues, there are bound to be losses and Arthur keeps the series feeling real by breaking our hearts when it happens. Add to that Bodenâ€™s personal vendetta against the Shadow Shifters and Croweâ€™s machinations to create a hybrid super soldier, well that insured tons of action in this installment. But all of that was mild in comparison to what is simmering between Eli and Nivea because the secrets they each harbor may end their pairing before it can even begin.While none of the female mates in this series have had it easy, Arthur outdid herself with Niveaâ€™s backstory. The hints given regarding Niveaâ€™s past did not prepare me for the truth of why she left the seemingly lavish lifestyle she was raised in and why she remains estranged from her parents. When the details began to be revealed I actually reread the scene because the what wasnâ€™t even on my radar. Shocked doesnâ€™t even begin to describe my reaction. And yet Nivea refused to let her past define her and embraced her Shadow Shifter heritage fully, much to the dismay of her sisters. It is her determination in overcoming her past that made Nivea the perfect match for Eli because like her, his past left him scarred, but unlike her, Eli has not overcome it, allowing his past to define him as he refuses to believe that a mate will help him overcome his â€œcurseâ€ or that he is deserving of happiness. Eliâ€™s refusal to acknowledge theyâ€™re meant to be mates forces Nivea to call upon her determination because sheâ€™s not just fighting Eli, sheâ€™s also fighting the ghosts of his past.I loved watching this relationship play out. Eli gives new meaning to the phrase hard-headed man with his refusal to acknowledge Nivea as his mate. My heart broke for Nivea each time he rebuffed her or snuck out the morning after, but man were those nights between them hot! But even as my heart ached for her, I loved that she was sure in her belief that she deserved happiness and that Eliâ€™s rejections were on him and not a reflection of her. And even as he denied her as his mate, Eli had her back when her loyalty to the Shadow Shifters was in question. While I havenâ€™t read all of the books in the series, I like that Arthur develops the relationship within the ongoing conflicts â€“ the war doesnâ€™t stop for love. This serves to strengthen their bond as they face their enemies head on. Primal Heat was a great addition to The Shadow Shifters series and I love the possibilities that about with the open ending of the book â€“ not a cliffhanger per se, but it certainly leaves many, many avenues open for the author to take.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPI3TLHVG9VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSG8I5C#wasThisHelpful","RQPI3TLHVG9VF","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I finished The Strongest Steel I wasnâ€™t sure whether to give it four or five stars. Without a doubt, the book was great and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But I reserve five stars for those books Iâ€™d like to read again or that impact me significantly. I just wasnâ€™t sure where on the spectrum this book fell â€“ whether or not it was something I would consider rereading. So I slept on it. The next morning I was still undecided. Yet my indecision was still not enough to relegate it to a 4-star read as I tend to do when I havenâ€™t committed myself to the full five stars. But as I sat down to write this review and thought more and more about the journey that Harper takes and all that she overcomes in the course of the novel, I find myself with no doubts that it is indeed a 5-star read for me.Itâ€™s obvious from our first encounter with Harper that she has suffered something beyond tragic that has left her scarred â€“ inside and out. Even when we see her first meeting with Trent at the tattoo studio and her reactions to his touch as well as her reactions to physical contact with others, I was not prepared for the magnitude of what she suffered and the lengths to which she went in her quest to feel safe again. But the revelations of her past makes the relationship that develops between her and Trent that much more meaningful, impressive, sweet, heartwarming, fulfilling, you get the picture. While Trent does not lack for female company and has a bevy of beauties at his disposal, his usual tactics are thrown out the window when it comes to Harper. He wants more than a one-night stand or short-term relationship with her and heâ€™s willing to put in the time and effort itâ€™s going to take to break through her defenses. And as they spend more and more time together in the studio and out, he realizes that sheâ€™s worth the effort â€¦ even when her past comes back with vengeance on his mind.I really liked how much the book focused on the relationship between Trent and Harper and how Trent took it slow with her. He took what he knew of her history into consideration and didnâ€™t push her or rush her. This allowed for a friendship to develop first and then they built upon it. I also liked that Trentâ€™s touch didnâ€™t â€œcureâ€ her. Even after she was accustomed to Trent touching her, Harper still flinched when Cujo touched her and during her training with Frankie. Cole kept this aspect of the story true to life by making it the repeated exposure to others that enabled Harper to accept touch more and more as the book progressed. While Harperâ€™s abduction by her ex wasnâ€™t a surprise plot wise, I appreciated that the author kept short and that Harper was able to use Frankieâ€™s training â€“ it may feel a bit anticlimactic for some readers, but I liked that it wasnâ€™t drawn out. Even though I really didnâ€™t like Trentâ€™s response to Harperâ€™s less-than-thrilled reaction to his news about the reality show, it felt appropriate to the situation considering Trentâ€™s past and it showed that he was human too. My only real complaint about The Strongest Steel would be that the Reid angle felt extremely unfinished. Harperâ€™s brotherâ€™s desertion of her and their family when her ex was convicted didnâ€™t sit right; it didnâ€™t make sense for a brother who had protected her their entire life until Nathan tried to kill her would simply vanish from their lives. I can only assume that the author will be giving us more on Reid in a future installment in the series. Regardless, I absolutely loved the camaraderie between the Second Circle family and cannot wait to read more. Iâ€™m already looking forward to the next installment to find out whatâ€™s really going on between Drea and Cujo.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UJIGC98A1PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE0OS4S#wasThisHelpful","R2UJIGC98A1PE","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I enjoyed Ascension, it required more of a suspension of reality than the previous installments in the series. After all, weâ€™re looking at a relationship between Conner, who weâ€™ve only known as a spirit, and Sevâ€™s nephew Rogelio. Without spoiling the book for potential readers, this means you are either going to have a relationship between a spirit and a living being OR two spirits if Ro were to pass away during the book. As the blurb intimates of Conner feeling desire for the first time in many, many years, itâ€™s pretty much a given that weâ€™ll be treated to some hot sex regardless of the nature of the pairing. So either way, you should be prepared for even more of a paranormal angle to the story than weâ€™ve seen in previous installments because living or dead, Bradford brings the heat to McKinton.Ascension takes place quite a few years after What Remains and weâ€™re meeting a 28 year-old Rogelio, who still resides in McKinton with his parents as his motherâ€™s health has been failing over the years and his father can use the help in caring for her. When Alma passes sooner than expected, we are given the first glimpse within the series of what happens to those spirits not bound to the world and it scared the bejeezus out of Conner because he didnâ€™t want to leave Laine, Sev, or even Rogelio behind. Having been close to his mother, Ro took her passing hard and spiraled downward into a depression that had him engaging in some risky behaviors. Roâ€™s apathy made it easy for him to fall victim to a man whose treatment of him was abusive and even though the author is kind enough not to make the reader watch the man we last knew as a boy be mistreated, there is enough information provided that you have no doubt of what happened to Ro. When one thing leads to another, Conner finds himself claiming the young man he has fallen in love with over the years, surprised to learn that the feelings of affection are returned. And the two men embark upon a relationship that knows no bounds.Whereas the previous books in the series have had more of a contemporary romance feel with just a little paranormal twist to them, Ascension is a full-fledged paranormal romance. As much as I hated what Ro endured when his mother passed, I liked that he was able to find comfort in Conner and that the two men were finally able to express their feelings for each other. The time frame within the book is hard to pin down, but that seems intentional because Connerâ€™s concept of time is more fluid as a spirit. That combined with the shared history between Conner and Ro kept it from feeling like an insta-love situation when Roâ€™s psychic ability finally manifested. True to form, Bradford insures that the men are able to consummate their relationship and it is heavenly (pun intended). I was surprised that more didnâ€™t come of the JD angle, especially considering the man approached Roâ€™s father and Laine found out about it. Ascension was an enjoyable addition to the Southern Spirts series and Iâ€™m looking forward to reading Stefanâ€™s story in Whirlwind as the little bit I saw of Stefan at the end of Ascension hints at a rather interesting dynamic.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XW4ZXS1NKTYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OF1XAG#wasThisHelpful","R1XW4ZXS1NKTYH","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel the need to explain that a 2-star rating does not mean that this is a bad book. For me, 2 stars is indicative of a book that is just okay and thatâ€™s how I felt after finishing Groomzilla â€“ it was just okay. There were several things about the book that kept me from enjoying it more, the biggest being Aaron. I had a really hard time reconciling the hard-nosed ADA Aaron was supposed to be with the child-like brat that often appeared when things didnâ€™t go his way. At one point in the story, Aaron pouts because Peter gets called in to work a homicide â€“ this was too childish, especially for an ADA who prosecutes homicide cases. This is not a matter of Aaron being submissive to Peter, but more that Aaronâ€™s work personality and brat personality are so contradictory that it didnâ€™t ring true for me. Thereâ€™s a difference between submissive behavior and childish behavior and Aaronâ€™s behavior was often too juvenile for the adult he was purported to be. Now had Groomzilla been marketed as age-play rather than (or in addition to) spanking, it would have perhaps been more believable. I wouldnâ€™t have read it because I donâ€™t enjoy age-play books and while I wonâ€™t say that itâ€™s full-on age-play, it is close enough for me to keep me from enjoying it. Those who do enjoy age-play books may find this to be a very enjoyable read.My other big issue was the memory of the first time Peter spanked Aaron. Except for Aaron yelling at the rookie cop â€“ the offense which triggered the spanking â€“ there was absolutely nothing about that scene that was believable to me. Even though they had been dating for a while and the reader is told that there is an understanding between the two men regarding the power dynamic in their relationship, there was nothing to indicate that spanking had been discussed, much less agreed upon. Furthermore, the spanking occurred in Aaronâ€™s office â€“ which is a public office where his subordinates could hear it. The whole scene violated professional workplace standards as well as consent between the parties and it really bothered me.Other than that one scene, Peter was actually what I enjoyed most about the book. He was attentive to Aaronâ€™s moods and followed through on punishment when earned, even when he didnâ€™t want to. That said, I felt there was too much of an emphasis on punishment in the book. Yes, I get that this is a spanking book so spanking will be a large part of it. But for me there was not enough emphasis placed on the actual relationship between Peter and Aaron. It seemed that most of the scenes between the two revolved around Peter punishing Aaron for yet another infraction. I just didnâ€™t feel the connection between Peter and Aaron that I should have from a long-term couple about to get married. I feel like Groomzilla has been marketed wrong, with too much emphasis being placed on the spanking and not enough on the brat/age-play aspect. Groomzilla is not a bad book, itâ€™s just not a book for me.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9EQNXCGOZRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAN5NCU#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9EQNXCGOZRB","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I have enjoyed all of the books in the Southern Spirits series to date, What Remains may be my favorite. Where When the Dead Speak focused on Laine and how his relationship with Sev developed, this book is more about Sev and his ability to communicate with the spirits. Set three years later, Sev and the other residents of McKinton are taken aback when they realize that the spirits of their friends and family are no longer present. While this is upsetting for all of the residents affected as they take comfort in knowing that the spirits in their lives are watching over them, their disappearance is especially devastating for Severo because a large part of his identity is tied to speaking with the spirits.That the disappearance coincides with the arrival of Chrisâ€™s motherâ€™s coven and an unexpected visit by one of Sevâ€™s sisters has Laineâ€™s cop instincts pinging. Truth be told, after what happened with Zekeâ€™s sister, I didnâ€™t blame Laine one bit for being wary over an out-of-the-blue phone call to mend the family ties. Yet when Alma, her husband, and their kids arrive, it is clear that the concern was for naught as they have finally broken from the financial ties Sevâ€™s parents hold over his siblings. Oh yes! We learn just how despicable Severoâ€™s parents are in this installment and as bad as I thought it was based on the previous books, I found out it was even worse than that. But when Severo learns what the final straw was that helped Alma cut ties, my heart warmed and broke at the same time for Alma and Rogelio. All the while that Sev is renewing his relationship with his sisterâ€™s family, he and Laine are trying to figure out who is behind the disappearance of McKintonâ€™s spirits. I must say that I was just as shocked as they were when they figured out who was responsible.I suppose itâ€™s because all of the spirits were missing that this installment felt more all-encompassing of the townâ€™s residents. While the focus was on Severo, Bradford gives readers the opportunity to catch up with each of the couples from the previous books, which is something I almost always enjoy when reading a series. Even though Sev has played a big role in several of the books, I felt as though I got to know him so much better as a man instead of just as Sev, The Ghost Whisperer. And I was so happy that his sisterâ€™s visit turned out so well. The inclusion of Miriamâ€™s coven in bringing the spirits back to McKinton made for an interesting facet of the story and I really enjoyed how that played out. I loved that the chemistry between Laine and Sev is just as strong after three years together, and perhaps even stronger. What Remains was an excellent addition to the Southern Spirits series and I am already looking forward to reading Ascension.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJDAQM30QQTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015E9GCYO#wasThisHelpful","R1LJDAQM30QQTS","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I feel sorry for all of Killough-Waldenâ€™s fans who read The Seelie King and then had to wait eight months for the release of The Unseelie King because I could barely wait the five minutes it took my Kindle to download and open the book. Okay thatâ€™s an exaggeration â€¦ it probably took a minute and that was too long of a wait. While itâ€™s true that I have wanted the next book in the series each time I finished reading an installment, the fact that books five and six are so closely entwined made the need to go from one book to the next even stronger. And in true storyteller fashion, the author kept me on edge and at rapt attention the first page to the last.The Unseelie King picks up where The Seelie King left off, with the discovery of the death of Selene and Minervaâ€™s parents, but this time weâ€™re seeing firsthand Minervaâ€™s reaction and when her grief turns to rage, you come to understand why the old fae kings feared the power of the wishers so much. Unlike her sister, Minerva taps in to her innate fae knowledge almost immediately upon her transformation and sets out to make the world pay for its injustices. Fortunately Caliban understands his queenâ€™s darkness better than his brother understood his brideâ€™s and heâ€™s ready to do what it takes to keep her from regretting her actions, even if it means heâ€™ll never be able to claim his queen. And I must admit, even knowing that the queens are fated for their kings, I was right there with Caliban in doubting that their pairing would come to pass. Surprisingly, it was something as simple as food that breaks Minervaâ€™s resolve and I for one want to know what the heck rainbow crepe cake is and where I can get some. But it is witnessing the potential of her power that shatters Minervaâ€™s final wall and Caliban begins to make inroads in the claiming of his queen. And oh what a claiming it was!I appreciated the authorâ€™s symmetry between The Seelie King and The Unseelie King. While all of the queens have been targeted once their identities were discovered, in both Selene and Minervaâ€™s cases the threat against them came from within the fae realm and we finally learned who it was and why. And I just have to say â€¦ creepy! I really liked the authorâ€™s take on the myth of the unicorns. Itâ€™s not the first time that Iâ€™ve seen unicorns presented as the less than idyllic magical and gentle creatures we like to see them as, but it is a rarity and I found the reason behind it to be quite fascinating as was Minervaâ€™s wish. Laluraâ€™s discovery that there is another traitor among the kingsâ€™ ranks was disheartening to say the least, especially if it is as they suspect, motivated by jealousy. But it does keep the suspense level high in the series, especially in light of Imaniâ€™s divination. We also learned a bit more about the realms of the various kings and that the ever elusive Shadow King will soon be revealed as his bride is the next to be found. But the best part â€“ aside from Caliban and Minerva â€“ was learning Laluraâ€™s secret and I was both surprised by it, yet not.

"Clayton has done it again! Granted I have only read her Cocktail series, but that will soon be remedied as the brief meeting of Grace and Jack in Nuts has guaranteed that the Redhead series (which I apparently snagged on sale) will be gracing my vacation reading list this holiday season. But I am happy to report that the same level of humor that Clayton brought to the Cocktail series is as present as ever in Nuts and I for one am already salivating over the plethora of plots that Hudson Valley has to offer. Before I get to the actual story, I STRONGLY recommend you read the Acknowledgements. I rarely do, yet for some reason I found myself reading (and snorting) my way through it and it gave me a frame of reference that I think increased my enjoyment of the book.Roxie is a blast. Sheâ€™s a hoot. A one-woman comedy act, whether she means to be or not. Sheâ€™s the kind of woman you want to count as one of your closest friends because you know your life will never be dull as long as sheâ€™s in it. Yes, I may very well have a girl-crush on Roxie. But itâ€™s only fair as I was seriously crushing on Leo too â€¦ that man could farm my dell any day. What starts out as an extremely reluctant (and thatâ€™s putting it mildly folks) Roxie returning home to Hudson Valley for the summer to run the family diner while her mother runs The Amazing Race (I know!!!) quickly shapes up to be one of the best summers of Roxieâ€™s life, all thanks to a man who really knows his nuts â€¦ and fruits and vegetables and come on, you might as well get used to it because Claytonâ€™s writing insures that there are more opportunities for double entendres than I can possibly resist. But seriously, Leoâ€™s passion for organic and sustainable farming was well-matched by Roxieâ€™s passion for cooking, so their relationship made sense. Despite the built-in expiration date on their relationship â€“ because Roxie was going back to California as soon as the summer was over â€“ Roxie found herself falling for Leo and beginning to wonder if maybe, just maybe, the small-town feel of Hudson Valley was less suffocating and more comforting than it was in her youth. Yet when Roxie learns Leoâ€™s secret, she feels as though her world is imploding once again and sheâ€™s left feeling confused, betrayed, and stung.While there are tons of laughs throughout, itâ€™s Roxieâ€™s reaction to bees that had me chuckling fondly as they reminded me of a childhood friend. The chemistry between Leo and Roxie is perfect both in the bedroom and outside of it. Their first and second meetings were priceless and had me in stitches. Roxieâ€™s reaction to Leoâ€™s secret felt realistic and we learned far more about her in that moment than I think she was even aware of herself. Even when she decides to give Leo a chance to explain, the resolution isnâ€™t instant as they are both hesitant as to how to move forward. Although the book is told from Roxieâ€™s point of view, I love that Clayton tends to reserve the Epilogue for a different characterâ€™s point of view and in the case of Nuts we are treated to Leoâ€™s. And it was perfect as was this book. I cannot wait for the next book in the Hudson Valley series.

"Dance with Me is only the second of Cullinanâ€™s books that Iâ€™ve read, but having loved Carry the Ocean I was excited for the opportunity to read another M/M romance by the author. I am delighted to say that was not the least bit disappointed as this is a book I can see myself reading again and again and again.The Overture (or prologue) does a wonderful job of introducing us to the main players â€“ Ed and Laurie. We get to see them both at the height of their careers and experience their nerves and excitement as they step out onto their respective stages. Then we get to see what it is that brings their careers to a screeching halt and the scenes play out with so much emotion that I was invested in both men within pages. Considering how different their backgrounds are, itâ€™s not the least bit surprising that they rubbed each other the wrong way in the beginning. With Laurie appearing to be the stereotypical flaming gay man, the exact persona that makes Ed cringe, and at the same time, Ed appearing to be the stereotypical jock to Laurie, the kind of guy that likely made his adolescence and early adulthood miserable, thereâ€™s no way these men will ever get along, much less be friends. Yet when the two men come together in dance, theyâ€™re beautiful. By that I mean that all of the judgements and preconceived notions fall away and they are simply two men who share a love and passion for the same thing â€“ dance.I have to say that I loved that Ed wasnâ€™t an in-the-closet gay man. Considering his athletic career, this actually shocked me, but it was a pleasant surprise that I thought played out very well in the novel. No, he wasnâ€™t in your face about it, but he didnâ€™t hide it from his teammates, friends, family, or the kids he worked with. Edâ€™s easy acceptance of himself is what made Laurieâ€™s disbelief so amusing. While on the surface, there is nothing about the two men that would make it seem as though they would work, the way their relationship developed was entirely believable. It wasnâ€™t so much of an opposites-attract situation as it was one in which a shared passion provided common ground on which they got to know one another. They dropped their walls and judgements and got to know the man in front of them. I had a hard time reading Edâ€™s depressive episodes as they were too realistic for me, hitting a bit close to home at times, but this just added to my connection with Ed. His motherâ€™s reaction when he said he wanted to clean his apartment was priceless as was her excitement as to the WHY. Both menâ€™s families added to the realism of the romance in their support and by driving them each nuts in the way only family can.

"As a fan of Barberâ€™s Neighborly Affection series, I was both excited and nervous to read Her Shirtless Gentleman. Excited because I love the authorâ€™s writing style, yet nervous because the book is unlike the Neighborly Affection series and I worried that I would discover it was the series and characters and not actually the authorâ€™s writing I enjoyed. However, within mere pages my nervousness was obliterated as I fell under the spell of Rob and Nora and their unfolding romance.We first meet Nora as she is out with the girls from work, and she means that literally as there is almost a decade between her and her 22 year-old coworkers. But as a divorcee, she doesnâ€™t feel she can be too choosey if she wants to avoid hitting the dating scene alone. Even though sheâ€™s striking out when compared to her friends, an encounter with a young man who canâ€™t hold his liquor insures that her evening will be memorable (<= thatâ€™s a serious understatement by the way). It was Noraâ€™s ability to laugh off the incident that endeared her to me because Iâ€™m not sure I would have been as understanding. But this unfortunate incident leads to her meeting Rob and him offering her the shirt off his back â€¦ literally â€¦ so that she doesnâ€™t have to suffer the indignity of the incident further. Unable to risk missing out on a chance with a woman that has finally caught his interest, they exchange numbers and a couple days later Rob invites her to lunch. And thus begins their courtship as Rob sets out to discover if Nora is all that she seems, if she could indeed be his forever girl.Unlike the Neighborly Affection series, Her Shirtless Gentleman is a vanilla romance, but donâ€™t for a minute think that equals a lack of steam. Barber reminds us what itâ€™s like to discover new love and a new lover â€“ the joys of kissing, touching, making out when it can only go so far, and finally embarking upon a new sexual relationship â€“ and just how erotic it can be to learn someone new as they learn you, especially when that someone is invested in your pleasure. I loved watching Rob woo Nora, and thatâ€™s exactly what it was â€¦ a wooing. He paid attention to what she said, what she didnâ€™t say, and how she reacted to him and situations, and because of this he realized rather quickly that his skittish Nora needed a soft touch. Fortunately for Rob, he was looking for a woman to settle down with for the long haul, not just a night or two, so he took his time with Nora. That he was also truly a gentleman made it that much easier for him to woo her because Noraâ€™s ex-husband was so not a gentleman it wasnâ€™t even funny. I loved the interactions between Rob and his parents and how inviting Robâ€™s family was of Nora. Her Shirtless Gentleman was a sweet romance with just the right amount of steam and a good dose of laughter.

"I have been anticipating Darren's story since he first appeared as the skittish new waiter in All of the Voices. While he's still skittish and comes with quite a bit of baggage, I was relieved that his past wasn't as bad as I was worried it was going to be. This made Aftermath a lighter read than I expected, but donâ€™t despair because it's not without its own intensity.Not to spoil the book for anyone, but I will readily admit that I was concerned that Darren was in McKinton because he was fleeing an abusive relationship. While he did indeed flee his hometown, he did so out of guilt and loss. Darren's best friend died two days after Darren's mother died. Because he had a boyfriend at the time, Darren felt as though he neglected Stefan and that Stefan wouldn't have died if he'd spent more time with him. As it turns out, Darren isn't the only one feeling guilty about Stefan's death and questioning if it was an accident or murder. Stefan's older brother Lee has been searching for Darren for more than a year in hopes of finding out more about his brother's final days. That Lee finds more than he was looking for when he catches up to Darren made Aftermath a lovely read for me â€“ kind of a second chance romance for Darren now that Lee sees him for the man heâ€™s become.There were several things about this installment in the Southern Spirits series that I enjoyed immensely. While I was relieved to learn why Darren was in McKinton, I was glad to see those around him take a more active part in his life and that they were able to do so without him bolting. Not only did this give Darren people to call friends, but it also gave him the opportunity to stand up for himself when he felt they were being too pushy. I also enjoyed watching the relationship develop between Darren and Lee and how taken aback Lee was when he first saw Darren after the years that have passed. He saw Darren as the man, rather than fixating on the image of the boy he knew as his brotherâ€™s best friend. This definitely made for some steamy scenes between the two. As for the spirits, I absolutely adored Stefan and understood his antics better once we learned more about him. It also helped to explain why Darren felt so guilty about Stefanâ€™s death and why Conner was protective of the young spirit. In fact, Connerâ€™s antics in Aftermath were priceless and the sheet incident would make for heck of a scene in a movie.

"Seriously?!?!?! Iâ€™m starting to believe that the author is now determined to make her readers cry with each book in this series. Even with Lilyâ€™s vision at the beginning of The Seelie King, I was wholly unprepared for what it meant when it came to fruition. And holy heck did that scene hurt like a mother. But noooo, ripping my heart out once wasnâ€™t enough for the author. Whatâ€™s astounding is that all of the emotional hits I took as I read through this installment in The Kings series is that they didnâ€™t directly involve the focus couple. Rather they were part of the series arc that continues to run through each book as we learn more and more about the master that Rafael answers to â€“ Kamon â€“ and what his end goal is. I was completely devastated and the only thing that kept me reading was I had to know how Killough-Walden â€œfixed itâ€ and what trials Avery would face as he claimed his Seelie Queen.Hopefully this isnâ€™t too much of a spoiler, but the novelty of The Seelie King is that the biggest threat the king faces when claiming his queen does not come from Kamon and his quarter. I wonâ€™t say who was responsible, but the attack on Avery and Selene nearly ends the Seelie King before he even has a chance to meet his queen, much less claim her. But itâ€™s what allows for Avery to undergo the bit of change he needs so that he can help his queen through her transition. I found The Unseelie Kingâ€™s theories regarding the attack to be as terrifying as the other kings did, but the truth was just as fascinating once it was revealed. Yet not nearly as entertaining as when Avery embraced his newfound darkness for a bit of mischief that led him to his queen.The Seelie King proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable read for me. With Avery being a bit off his normal game (and youâ€™ll understand why when you read the book), it makes his â€œcourtshipâ€ of his queen even more amusing. In part because she thinks heâ€™s crazy, and in part because heâ€™s more open to encouraging her transformation than I would have expected. That is, after he gets over his shock of what kind of fae she is and that The Wishers are no longer extinct. It was fun watching Selene get a bit of karmic justice while Avery guided her and kept her safe. And Killough-Walden demonstrates once again that she can pen a steamy mating scene that will leave no doubt about the claiming of the queen by her king. I love the way the author moves both the story arc and the series arc forward in The Seelie King, intertwining them when appropriate so that the other queens and kings can meet the new Seelie Queen and she can claim her place among the ranks â€“ even if the author does make me cry as she does it. This was another great addition to The Kings series and Iâ€™m off to read The Unseelie King to find out what Killough-Walden has in store for the dark court.I reviewed my personal copy of this book.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYRNTMLQQYQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOXGMH4#wasThisHelpful","R3QYRNTMLQQYQP","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fan of Durstonâ€™s writing, I was excited to get the opportunity to review Discovery. While I love paranormal romances, most of my reads have been of the MF variety. After finishing Discovery I now have another MM vampire book to add to my reread list. While human-vampire hybrids are not new to the genre, I liked the way in which the author added her own personal twist to make the creatures her own (or at least itâ€™s nothing Iâ€™ve encountered before). Actually I enjoyed it so much that I was again up until 2am reading and was nearly late to work because I got caught up in the story while I was reading it over breakfast.Discovery is an odd combination of intense actions scenes balanced with really calm day-to-day life scenes as the author introduces us to Jaret and Aaron. Jaret is a centuries old drakyl who really doesnâ€™t remember how old he is but knows itâ€™s been at least five centuries since his change. Aaron is a 32 year old Montana man who suffers from a sun allergy and feels as though he may very well beat his 86 year-old uncle to the grave. Or at least he thought he was human until Jaret stumbles upon the Drakyl Ranch and finds out that the man who so entranced him a few nights earlier has no idea of what he is. Once Jaret learns why Aaronâ€™s uncle kept his true nature from him, Jaret stays on to help out at the ranch and to be closer to Aaron because while he understands why Davis didnâ€™t tell Aaron that Drakyl is more than his last name, he will no longer allow the man to suffer as he has been for over a decade. And while Jaretâ€™s clock is ticking for Davis to â€˜fess up, thereâ€™s an even deadlier countdown taking place that may put everything that Jaretâ€™s found at risk.That the author chose to open the book with a fast-paced action scene as Jaret is attempting to evade capture by vampyrs sucked me right into the book and my attention never wavered, not even when the book was forced to slow down. Because this is the first book in the Drakyl Ranch series, there is a bit of world building which provides for a slow build to the book (after its initial scene). The author takes the time to introduce us to the main players amidst the action and the day-to-day workings of the ranch. I liked the chemistry between Jaret and Aaron and obviously enjoyed their sexy fun times. I also liked how well Aaron handled his transition and was willing to reassess his stance on human blood when Jaretâ€™s continued survival was at risk. The lengths to which a man in love will go is almost always entertaining. I LOVED that the author chose to include the attack on Jaret and Aaron at the end of the book rather than making readers wait for book two and the scene itself was intense (and highly satisfying for my blood lust). Discovery was an excellent read for me and I need book two NOW!!!I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCTN9PQPFIJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012OGOM4C#wasThisHelpful","R3LCTN9PQPFIJD","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Revolution we learn the fate of Adamâ€™s best friend Jameson and his mate Luuk. This proved to be quite the interesting read as the author had to balance out the depressing and harrowing effects of three years spent on the run after a cowardly ousting with the love between Jameson and Luuk, with the joy of Jamesonâ€™s eventual reunion with Adam, and with Luukâ€™s hope that he finally had allies and could successfully retake his position as the European Alpha Anax. Thatâ€™s a lot to juggle, yet Bradford does an impressive job of pulling it off and adding some seriously hot shifter sex to the mix.Having first learned of Jameson in Resilience, I was excited to read his and Luukâ€™s story. Admittedly I wasnâ€™t prepared for just how hard their lives have been since Luukâ€™s half-brother attempted to murder them three years ago. The author does a great job of communicating Jamesonâ€™s depression, anger, hopelessness, and love that I felt it all. And my heart broke for him when he was forced to let his wolf take control after yet another assassination attempt. Itâ€™s also what made the following scene at the church so emotionally distressing â€“ to think you have finally found sanctuary and then worry that itâ€™s not as safe as it appears certainly wreaked havoc on my nerves on Jamesonâ€™s behalf. So I was probably as relieved as Jameson and Luuk were when days later they found themselves safely ensconced with supporters and help on the way. Understandably, there is quite a bit of tension in this installment but itâ€™s done well and without being dragged out unnecessarily. And the challenge scene at the end â€¦ oh my, good stuff.While the focus of Revolution is on the relationship between Jameson and Luuk and all that they endure, the book actually made me fall in love with Marcus even more. His actions in the book show just how committed he is to the success of all shifters and not just those in his North American packs. It is true that part of his excuse for getting involved was through Gabeâ€™s relationship with Todd (Adamâ€™s mate), but this was merely what brought the situation to his attention. What I find exciting is that Marcusâ€™s concern doesnâ€™t end with the reinstatement of the proper Alpha Anax in Europe. Nope, heâ€™s also looking at the brutality being inflicted by the Alpha Anax of South America and this paves the way for even more stories in the Southwestern Shifters series. As I am thoroughly enjoying the series, this makes me quite happy as I am not looking for it to end anytime soon. Needless to say I am quite excited that Revenge is already loaded on my Kindle and I canâ€™t wait to read Ryderâ€™s story.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGQE5VWNGE30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3W655S#wasThisHelpful","RBGQE5VWNGE30","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is it wrong that I enjoyed Exposed so much more than I did Captive that I feel I should change my rating on Captive to 4 stars to reflect this? Maybe itâ€™s because Evie and Riley have a built in history that, despite five years apart, their connection is just as strong as ever and that made their romance feel more realistic to me regardless of all that was going on around them. Add to that a romantic suspense plot that provided for more action and intrigue than I remember experiencing while reading Captive, well that just insured even more enjoyment on my part.Much like his brother Gage, Riley is protective of those he loves. So learning that his deceased girlfriend was not dead and that his brother had been aware of it the whole timeâ€¦well Iâ€™m sure that would yank the rug out from under most anyone. But despite his anger and feelings of betrayal, Riley does what needs to be done to insure Evieâ€™s safety when her survival is discovered by the person who tried to have her murdered five years ago. Were that not enough, Walsh adds to the layers of Evieâ€™s character via a long-buried secret that she has never told anyone. While I had figured out what her secret was well before she even considered telling Riley what had happened, the author does an excellent job of showing how the secret affects the various parts of Evieâ€™s life â€“ even in the midst of having to deal with a target on her back. Fortunately the connection between Evie and Riley is such that they are unable to avoid the sparks flying between them for long and when that match is struck an inferno ensues. Seriously hot sex scenes!Due to Exposed being first and foremost (in my mind at least) a romantic suspense novel, there is little I can say about the actual plotline without risking spoilers. Once again I enjoyed Walshâ€™s style of writing, particularly that the book was presented from both Riley and Evieâ€™s points of view as it helped me see where each of them was coming from. I liked that Riley seemed more willing to talk than his brother did and that he had no qualms about sharing his feelings with Evie. There was no doubt as to his love for her. I thoroughly enjoyed how the end played out once Evieâ€™s pursuers caught up with her. Iâ€™m also glad that the author presented the events in the Epilogue in the way they were, as I was able to see the steps Evie took to regain her power without having to sit through the harrowing tale of how it was taken from her in the first place. Exposed is a great addition to the Captive series and I am looking forward to the next installment.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVC5BRJ9PGD4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S53XDSK#wasThisHelpful","RVC5BRJ9PGD4J","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret that I am a HUGE fan of the Bluewater Bay series. There hasnâ€™t been a book in the series yet that I havenâ€™t loved and When to Hold Them is no exception when it comes to my enjoyment. However, unlike the previous installments in the series (excluding book eight which I havenâ€™t read yet), I could not put this book down. It was not a matter of simply enjoying the story or being enamored by the characters or being caught up in their unfolding romance. No. I was, for lack of a better word, addicted to this book and it took every bit of self-restraint I had to put it down for a few hours to attend to prior obligations before I was snatching my Kindle back up and reading into the wee hours of the night to finish the other half. And it was so worth the lost hours of sleep.As I neared the halfway point I finally realized why I couldnâ€™t put this book down â€“ Gordon had literally seduced me with Doran and Xavierâ€™s relationship. I connected with Doran without actually realizing it because what I had in common with his character was not an obvious trait and it was this connection that led to my seduction. Doran is sexually submissive â€“ he craves a strong partner to care for him and take control of his pleasure. Ashamed of his actions that led to him being on probation, he has avoided a romantic relationship because he feels unworthy of love. Yet this doesnâ€™t keep him from fantasizing about the park ranger who fills up at the gas station across the street every week. When he finally works up the courage to cross the street one Sunday so he can talk to the ranger, Doran chickens out when it comes time to speak to him. Unbeknownst to Doran (and the reader at the time), he makes an impression on Xavier and when their paths cross again Xavier takes the initiative to chat with Doran. Although Xavier is relieved when he learns that the age difference is not at large as Doranâ€™s youthful appearance would suggest, he still feels that five years is a tad too much so when Doran flees he doesnâ€™t pursue him. Until their paths cross again. And this is where my seduction began, because as Xavier began to respond to Doranâ€™s signals and needs, I found myself falling under his spell right along with Doran. Xavierâ€™s dominance is subtle and this is likely due in part to it being in response to Doran as well as his personal need to temper his desires because heâ€™s not comfortable with them. But once Xavier came to terms with his needs, I was done for â€“ the sensual domination and submission that occurred between the couple made for a perfect reading experience for me.I feel I should note that while both characters are quite introspective, their personalities balance out in such a way that it wasnâ€™t overdone angst. Doran is an addict (gambling) and heâ€™s only twenty-two, so his inner thoughts are a tad chaotic between his guilt over what he did, shame for how his behaviors affected his aunt and uncle, resentment about the religious nature of the program heâ€™s been ordered to attend, and fear of being found by the people he owes money to. While this is tempered by his attraction to Xavier, the sense of calmness he experiences in Xavierâ€™s presence, and occasional bursts of joy when good things happen, the positives are quickly overshadowed by his negative thinking. This all made Doranâ€™s character feel so real to me just as Xavierâ€™s self-evaluation did the same for his character. What was truly impressive was that as the author is creating layers upon layers to the two characters and developing their relationship, Gordon also includes a realistic romantic suspense angle that plays out when Doranâ€™s past shows up in Bluewater Bay to collect on his debt. Fortunately Xavierâ€™s knowledge of the area and Doranâ€™s throwing arm meant that the worst-case scenario was not realized. When to Hold Them was an absolute pleasure to read and an excellent addition to the Bluewater Bay series. While it is my first Gordon novel, I plan to check out more of the authorâ€™s work in hopes of being seduced again.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S80KB49MQZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626492956#wasThisHelpful","R2S80KB49MQZ8","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reverence returns fans to the ongoing series storyline that was last visited at the end of Rendered. Up to bat is Harley, the human that Joshua Dobson kidnapped and terrorized back when he was trying to get Alex off of his trail. Not surprisingly Harley trusts no shifters and cannot leave Marcusâ€™s territory fast enough when finally given the okay to return home, no matter how strong of a pull he was feeling from the unconscious and injured shifter he discovered in the infirmary. Because he doesnâ€™t trust shifters, he refuses to tell Nathan and Marcus what Joshua did to him except to confirm that he was not raped. But as Harley sorts through his memories we learn that although he might not have been penetrated by Joshua or any of his men, he was violated. In an effort to â€œescapeâ€ his memories and nightmares, Harley begins clubbing, drinking, getting high, and hooking up with random strangers. It is during one of his clubbing nights that he encounters Val.Unbeknownst to Harley, Val is a shifter. Heâ€™s another of Joshuaâ€™s victims and heâ€™s been sent by Marcus and Nathan to insure Harleyâ€™s safety â€“ with strict instructions NOT to mess with him. Due to the injuries he sustained when Joshua hit him with the Hummer, Val doesnâ€™t ping Harleyâ€™s shifter-radar but he does set off Harleyâ€™s gaydar and Val is firmly in his sights for the night. While I didnâ€™t like that Val was injured, I had to agree with both men that having Valâ€™s wolf-side suppressed was probably the best thing that could have happened once they realized they were mates. After what Harley endured at Joshuaâ€™s hands, there was no way he would have accepted an aggressive shifter for a partner let alone as a mate. And while they didnâ€™t wait long before getting sexual â€“ and good grief was the alley scene HOT (only in books is making out in an alley sexy) â€“ they did take it slow (by shifter standards) and got to know and trust one another better before they fully consummated their relationship. I enjoyed watching them connect emotionally and building the level of trust needed for a non-shifter relationship. It also made for some hot foreplay and sex scenes.In addition to having Reverence pick the series thread back up, I liked how Bradford dropped in references from Resilience so that fans can identify where the booksâ€™ timelines overlapped. I really liked the introduction of Harleyâ€™s brother and am excited to find out where that storyline will take series as well because something is seriously brewing there. Reverence is another great addition to the Southwestern Shifters series and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Harley and Val heal mentally and physically so that they could start their lives post-Joshua Dobson anew â€¦ with each other.

"I started reading Nobodyâ€™s Hero expecting Dannyâ€™s sexual assault that is mentioned in the blurb to be the heavy part of the book. Boy was I wrong. Not to make light of Dannyâ€™s situation nor Bradâ€™s willingness to step in, but that scene turned out to be a minor scuffle once we learn why Brad is in the right place at the right time. While this is a new adult romance, the drama and angst isnâ€™t manufactured â€“ sadly itâ€™s reality based (not necessarily a true story, but this stuff happens) and completely understandable. This made for a very moving read as the author dealt with difficult subject matter in a sensitive way.*****THIS SECTION MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS*****When Brad overhears Dannyâ€™s date attempt to force him back into a vehicle to finish their evening, Brad is unable to stand by and do nothing, even if he has no idea of who Danny is. While Brad would prefer to go back to his truck once the incident is over, Danny insists on treating him to a drink while they wait for Dannyâ€™s brother to pick him up. Because he was raised by parents who love and accept him for who he is (his dadâ€™s comments later in the book are perfect when it comes to this), Danny has no problem opening up to Brad about being gay and discussing his family, friends, the town, and anything else he can to keep Brad occupied. Unfortunately Brad was not raised by accepting family (<=serious understatement) and tells Danny that itâ€™s not a good idea for them to hang out. Even when Brad ends up getting a job working with Danny, he continues to discourage anything between them. At first glance, it may appear that Brad is being an arse because he doesnâ€™t want anyone to know he is gay and is refusing to hang out with Danny to avoid being outed. But Bradâ€™s concerns arenâ€™t unfounded because the reason he has left his family and trust fund behind is that Bradâ€™s brother is in jail for assault and attempted murder when he beat up and tried to kill the boy Brad was caught kissing. As much as you would like to believe that that horror story only appeared in books, itâ€™s unfortunate that such incidents are a reality in our world and once you learn all the details about what Bradâ€™s brother did, you understand why Brad pushes Danny away and even once they begin seeing one another, why he refuses to make their relationship public knowledge.*****END OF POTENTIAL SPOILERS*****Considering what Brad was dealing with, I was caught between feeling badly for him because of his past and his undeserved feelings of guilt and feeling badly for Danny because he was caught between understanding why Brad acted the way he did, yet wanting for more and hoping to break through Bradâ€™s fears. I was glad that Danny wasnâ€™t afraid to call Brad out on certain things and that helped get through to him eventually. I liked how the author built a little bit of suspense around the situation with Dannyâ€™s brother and how it played out because it not only showed how family sticks together, but also gave Brad an unexpected chance to stand up to his mother. And I LOVED the Ortega family! They were so welcoming to Brad and the love they have for one another was so very apparent in their everyday interactions. I thought the ending was perfect for both Danny and Brad.

"Unlike the previous books in the Southwestern Shifters series, Resilience does not pick up where Rendered left off and continue the seriesâ€™ storyline. Instead it goes back to before Gabe met Mika in the first book of the series, Rescued, and we meet the Todd that was physically and mentally abused by his parents despite being an adult and bullied by his boss â€“ the town sheriff that Gabe was trying to keep from killing strays by rescuing them. As painful as it was to see what Todd endured, it helped put some of his behaviors in perspective. Thereâ€™s enough history provided that you understand why Gabe was so important to Todd, why Mikaâ€™s sudden appearance in Gabeâ€™s life unsettled Todd, and why he had such a hard time interacting with Adam when the new vet moved to town and set up shop. While the timeline of Resilience overlaps with all of the previous books, its focus is on Todd, Adam, and their relationship so itâ€™s not a replay of the other books.The history that Bradford crafted for Todd is heartbreaking. I hated seeing the little bits and pieces that played out in the book because it was awful knowing that the abuse he was subjected to growing up was even worse. I was surprised to learn that Todd hadnâ€™t confided in Gabe as to his own homosexuality and it wasnâ€™t until Adam moved to town that Gabe finally broached the subject. Although we arenâ€™t provided as much of Adamâ€™s background as we are Toddâ€™s, it becomes obvious rather quickly that Adam has his own baggage. Although Adam moved to Shasta with the intention of becoming a bit of a spinster (for lack of a better term), he finds himself attracted to Todd almost immediately. There are times when each manâ€™s apprehension and caution are amusing, but I was relieved when Adam became aware of Toddâ€™s inexperience and exercised patience and understanding as he helped Todd find his way. The attraction between the two men is almost immediate but because of their respective pasts and the (seemingly) bigoted nature of Shasta, they are very slow to act upon it and attempt to go the friend route first. But when they do finally get together, they are scorching hot and their subsequent couplings are increasingly so as the book progresses.There is a TON of stuff that occurs in this book that I simply canâ€™t discuss because of spoiler issues, but I will say that the action is far more intense than I expected for Todd and Adamâ€™s book. I was glad to see that Toddâ€™s father and boss both got what they deserved and itâ€™s a shame that Toddâ€™s mother didnâ€™t as well. I loved seeing the town rally behind Todd and Adam and it was as heartwarming to see as watching Todd and Adam fall in love. Itâ€™s not often that I comment on a bookâ€™s cover, but I must say that I was surprised by the cover for Resilience as both Todd and Adam are human. Itâ€™s not until almost 80% into the book before the wolf on the cover is explained and I must admit that it was AWESOME! I really didnâ€™t see that coming, but I shouldnâ€™t have doubted Bradford. Resilience was an excellent addition to the Southwestern Shifters series and Iâ€™m looking forward to reading Reverence next.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MV3RXPGHXE7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CDWSW4#wasThisHelpful","R1MV3RXPGHXE7V","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Ryder Dent. This man is a tried and true southern gentleman and heâ€™s just one of those characters I would love to befriend in real life. Heâ€™s a good oleâ€™ boy without being a bigot. At seventeen he stepped up to the plate when his best friend needed him and they built a family together so that she didnâ€™t have to deal with her father once her pregnancy came to light. He raised her son as his own with no one the wiser â€“ no matter how much conjecture there was as to how two blue-eyed people could not produce a brown-eyed child (and I loved that genetics lesson). Ryder has a big heart so even when he screws up, it always comes from a place of love and never out of malice or meanness â€“ something both Ryder and Andi were subjected to growing up. And above everything, he loves his son unconditionally, biology and blood be damned. Maxfield created such a great character in Ryder, Iâ€™d be hard-pressed not to love him and that makes Andi and Declanâ€™s love for him understandable.Ryder has never regretted his choice to marry Andi and step up as Jonasâ€™s dad. He gave up a scholarship and college education to become a father, remain in town, and run his fatherâ€™s business. Once he realized he was gay at age fourteen, he accepted that he could never live as a gay man in his hometown and the family he created with Andi and Jonas made up for that because he loves them both. They are his world. He was content to live out the rest of his life that way until Dr. Declan Winters moves to town and Ryder finds himself in a situation heâ€™s never encountered before â€“ wanting to pursue another man. When Ryder and Declan eventually get together, they are seriously hot together. Thankfully Declan gave Ryder another chance after he screwed up their first encounter so completely.I will admit that I spent a good deal of the book disliking Andi. Oftentimes the things she said to Ryder and the way she interacted with him made her seem selfish in my book. Her refusal to contact Jonasâ€™s biological father to ask him to terminate his parental rights so that Ryder could adopt Jonas really ticked me off at her â€“ it seemed as though she was more willing to risk Jonasâ€™s happiness than deal with a situation the was upsetting for her. Her plans to tour with the band coupled with her fatherâ€™s extreme dislike of Ryder just spelled disaster and while Iâ€™m glad the author didnâ€™t take the story in the direction, it just added one more mark against Andi for me. Thankfully she got her act together by the end and wiped the slate clean. My main complaint about My Cowboy Promises is that I felt as though it ended too soon. I would have liked to see what Ryderâ€™s father did once Helen got through to him; just as I would have liked to see whether or not Andiâ€™s father was brought to heel. I can only hope that the next book in The Cowboys series gives us an opportunity to catch up with Ryder, Declan, Andi, and Jonas to see how theyâ€™re faring in their new family.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWS3ZR7X7WAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H87RM9K#wasThisHelpful","R2NWS3ZR7X7WAA","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually the first of the Hot Rods series I've read and while Touch of Amber can be enjoyed as a standalone, I've been assured that the earlier books on the series do not do as well on their own. This is perhaps due to the fact that this book features the weddings of the couples and trios from the earlier installments. So while I had no problem following along with the developing relationship between Amber and Gavyn, I suspect fans of the series will enjoy it even more than I did and that's saying a lot because I enjoyed the heck out of it.Amber is a bit of a control freak, which makes her the perfect choice to plan the simultaneous weddings of the Hot Rod crew. The author did an excellent job of showing how much the crew respects and cares about Amber during their interactions, even if she's not into the polyamorous relationships they are. But when the wedding bus encounters a delay that is outside of Amber's control, she immediately goes into action to keep the unexpected delay from impacting the wedding weekend. Fortunately for all, Gavyn happens upon the crew and steps in to help Amber keep things on schedule. Because he is already taken with her, he seizes upon the opportunity to spend time with her by offering his help. This also had the added benefit of him keeping busy, which would help him avoid alcohol as he is in recovery. While the control freak is hesitant to delegate, Amber soon accepts his help and the two find their chemistry is even stronger than they anticipated. To celebrate the successful, if altered wedding, Amber and Gavyn discover just how compatible in bed they are and boy were they hot together. Unfortunately Gavyn's concerns regarding his worthiness lead him to self-destruct and push Amber away.While Rylon does an excellent job of showing how the beginnings of a relationship between Amber and Gavyn form and are then destroyed so thoroughly within a single night, I actually appreciated that she moved their story ahead by three months. The spectacularly destructive way in which their relationship went down in flames before it even had a chance meant that it was unnecessary to show how both Amber and Gavyn had suffered during that time â€“ the added angst wasn't needed to show their emotional pain. I thought it was sweet as could be when their matchmaker got involved and I was glad that they were able to talk it out. As hard as it was to see Amber send Gavyn away that first night, it was an authentic reaction by her character. It also made the following day's event even more important.  I thoroughly enjoyed Touch of Amber and will be adding the previous books in the series to my to-be-read list so I can see how everyone's relationships developed and I really hope to do it before the next book in the series is released because I suspect I will need all that background to fully appreciate it.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K0I1BD6FOH0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVIXXXG#wasThisHelpful","R2K0I1BD6FOH0P","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hallelujah! Joshua Dobson is finally made to answer for his sins and we learn in Rendered that he has committed far more than anyone realized. After failing his Alpha Anax so completely, Alex set off at the end of Reckless to track down Joshua Dobson and make him pay for Marcusâ€™s abduction and torture. Rendered picks up with Alex finding Joshuaâ€™s trail after several false starts and having to call in for backup once he realized he was too outnumbered to take on Dobson and his pack. His decision to call in turns out to be quite fortuitous as he not only learns that Marcus had full faith in his abilities (after all, it was only Alex claiming he failed in his duties), but it also keeps him from unknowingly violating one of Marcusâ€™s edicts â€“ no harm is to come to Sean Dobson. And itâ€™s when Alex encounters Sean that things get REALLY interesting.Sean is Joshua Dobson little brother. Heâ€™s the young man who risked and received several beatings for helping Marcus while he was being held by Joshua. Heâ€™s also Alexâ€™s mate. And didnâ€™t that just tick Alex off. But when Marcus and his mate Nathan stand up for Sean and make Alex realize how foolish and disrespectful he is being by refusing his mate, he begins to reconsider his personal ban on all things Dobson. But because both men were victimized by Joshua and Sean is still healing from his brotherâ€™s attempt to kill him, Alex takes a few days to actually get to know his mate and build a bond that becomes vital to their healing â€“ both of their healing. While Joshua Dobson is not an honorable man, he had every intention of fulfilling the last promise he made to his brother â€“ if he survived the last punishment, Joshua would come a collect him because as far as he was concerned, Sean belonged to him.There were several things I really liked about Rendered. Obviously I really, Really, REALLY liked that Joshua was brought to justice (youâ€™ll have to read the book to find out what his punishment was). This of course was tied with the emotional healing that Alex and Sean begin to undergo once they accept one anotherâ€™s mating mark. With both men being victims of the same abuser, they had an insight into the otherâ€™s emotional pain that few others did. But rather than dwelling on their shared pain, they chose to move forward together. Alex and Sean are not only good for one another, their mate bond leads to some seriously hot sex scenes throughout the book. My only complaint about Rendered is that we didnâ€™t get to find out what nicknames Gabe gave Alex and Sean. Hopefully that tidbit will be revealed in Resilience.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5J02UJPDSVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006UAU04K#wasThisHelpful","R3S5J02UJPDSVC","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked ReadsDid you know that pleading ""no, no, no, no, no, no, no"" at the end of the book does not help you avoid getting shoved off a cliff by an author? I did, but it didn't stop the words from flying out of my mouth when I hit the last page of End of Day. Keep in mind that when I first signed up to review the book I had no idea that it was the first installment in a series. But that knowledge wouldn't have stopped me from signing up to review it nor would knowing there was a cliffhanger as I pretty much accept that a cliffhanger is highly probably when a book is part of a series. Why would I have tread forth despite knowing that a cliff was in my imminent future? Because after reading Idle Bloom, I fell in love with Ms. Annâ€™s writing and Only Trick sealed the deal, so I jumped at the chance to review End of Day. And I am so very glad that I did because I loved this book and cannot wait for its sequel.Both of the previous books of Ms. Ann's that I've read featured broken characters. While it's true that Jillian and Sarge have bloodied posts, broken is far too mild of a term for them. Sarge (AJ) is career military but is now in an advisory role after having been diagnosed with PTSD. At first glance, his refusal to accept the diagnosis seems like a case of machismo, but as the story progresses itâ€™s revealed that AJ refuses to accept the label because he sees it as an excuse for his behavior and he engages in some pretty horrific behavior. Sarge is not looking for absolution or acceptance and yet he may find just that in Jillian because she might be the only person who is just as mucked up as he is. Jillian is trying to embrace her new life in Nebraska but sheâ€™s having a difficult time letting Jessica go. As Jillian tells Jessicaâ€™s story to her deaf neighbor Lilith, we learn that the devil really is in the details. Merely knowing that Jessica was abducted and forced to watch her best friend murdered is nothing compared to finding out exactly what she witnessed. While itâ€™s true that very few people would come out unscathed after witnessing their best friend murdered, once the details were revealed it put Jillianâ€™s behaviors in a whole new light for me. Her unique pre-abduction past is probably the only reason sheâ€™s still functioning even if her coping skills are less than ideal. The sex scenes are a mix of sweet and loving (Jessicaâ€™s past) and rough and violent in a fight for dominance (Jillianâ€™s present), and both types are hot for entirely different reasons. The relationship that is developing between Jillian and Sarge works for them, but it will difficult reading for some and is not for the faint of heart. Because of their pasts, their relationship has an edge of violence that may be problematic for some readers, so do proceed with caution.This is the third book by Ms. Ann that I have read and I still find myself blown away by her talent. She is able to combine elements of romance, suspense, hot sex, and humor to make her damaged characters feel real, and in the case of End of Day she has added a darker element with Jessicaâ€™s past that I didnâ€™t expect, and she makes it all work. I will warn you that this book is a bit slow to start, but when youâ€™re dealing with what is essentially a non-government-sanctioned witness relocation program and the first book of a series there is a foundation that must be built. However once the story got going I absolutely hated when I had to put it down to attend to other things â€“ there was no getting lost on social media for hours while I read this book. Nope, I did what I had to do and returned to the book immediately because I wanted to see Jessica and Jillianâ€™s story unfold and the way in which Ms. Ann wove Jessicaâ€™s past into Jillianâ€™s present was fabulous. Even knowing that Jackson and Jillian ended up in Peaceful Woods didnâ€™t make their journey there any less interesting. On the contrary, I was mesmerized by what Jessica endured before she became Jillian. I loved that rather than her past breaking her and turning her into a scared and submissive woman, sheâ€™s a scary as hell badass that has no problem dishing it out or taking it. Unlike Idle Bloom and Only Trick, there is little healing between Sarge and Jillian in this book, but as itâ€™s only the first in the series I suspect that there is much more to come. I do so hope that Ms. Ann is well into the writing of the sequel because I need it yesterday.~ Wicked Reads Review Team ~","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8GZ38KU4FS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YPN6QM#wasThisHelpful","R3N8GZ38KU4FS8","A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIZ03ZV5VF1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The earlier edition of the book was titled ""The Minto Pyramid Principle"". Wisely, Mrs Minto, the author, has removed her name from the title of the book. She still tries to milk her idea and the book is now self-published and sells on her website for $150. That is seriously overpriced.This book is full of interesting ideas, but it is also frustrating to read because its poor organisation. It also lacks realistic examples to clarify the ideas. Furthermore, the author is not able to express herself with sufficient clarity. Given these major weaknesses, I would not recommend this book for a wider audience.

"This is a decent, uneven encyclopedic account of original recipes from the various Nordic/Scandinavian countries. It is written by one rather young chef so there are a number of weaknesses, but still a decent effort if you want an encyclopedia. One such is the total lack of knowledge of saltwater fish. It is so much more than herring. Very few pages devoted to fish despite the region having a huge coast line.The region has suffered greatly through the centuries from its Lutheran ministers preaching that it is sinful to enjoy food. This is very apparent from the the crudeness of many of the recipes. So I doubt that you will be inspired to cook Nordic/Scandinavian food by reading this book, unless you for some reason are hooked on the cuisine already.I would not recommend it to most people.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315A23Q153RWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0714868728#wasThisHelpful","R315A23Q153RWT","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find this book very uneven. It has a  very interesting plot with the Muslim Brotherhood gaining the presidency of France. All kinds of unholy alliances are formed to keep the National Front (far-right) away from power. The author describes well how Islam can make itself attractive to educated men. This is especially scary. However, women suffer greatly due to Sharia law being implemented in the state-run universities. The depiction of a future possible France is interesting and scary. The depiction has some flaws (e.g.Saudi Arabia still being rich, women do not protest), but the author's vision is strong and compelling.The main character is a bored-with-life academic specializing in literature. He meets different people, who in turn convey the macro-picture described above. I find him very cardboard like and I do not really appreciate having a spineless person as the main character, but that is the author's choice. The tone of the book becomes very bleak, but I think an Islamist would actually welcome the description. Finding such a balance in the description is fascinating and shows the author's skill.There is no strong narrative, the lack of which makes to book rather dull for most potential readers. For educated readers, the book offers a scathing critique of Islam. It is amazing how the cultural elite in Western Europe can praise a book with such a negative view on Islam.I didn't really enjoy reading the book, even though it was interesting. It is possible to debate the book for hours. So I am very glad I read it. The book is worth between 3 and 4 stars, but I settle for 3.

"There are two kind of pop-science books; one deep and thoughtful based on years of research, one quick and dirty written by a ghost-writer. This book is of the latter kind. Tetlock wrote Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? about a decade ago. That book was deep and thoughtful. I had expected his new book to be an update with ten more years of research and consulting. Sadly, I am greatly disappointed. The book could have been written totally without additional research input. It starts with a couple of chapters of the history of the standard controlled experiment. There is about 50 pages of real content in the 330 pages of the book.There is a lot of content directly lifted from the web (e.g. Fermi-forecasting, Auftragstaktik) - kind of Malcolm Gladwell style, some insight and some misinterpretation.The style is **extreme pop-science**. What do I mean with that? Far too many pages, plentiful descriptions of minute irrelevant details of individuals (so called human interest points - I guess that is what they teach in creative writing), never any figure or number (e.g. 67% is changed to two thirds), all difficult material removed or put in a footnote. And how come a book with two authors use the pronoun ""I"" all the time?The researcher has run a forecasting tournament for several years. He has loads of data, but he does not provide any analysis in the book. He refers to his research in footnotes, but no explanation or description at all. Instead we get statements like 80% of superforecasters are more intelligent than average. What is wrong with running a regression to find out what characteristics are important? Why spend five chapters going through the characteristics of superforecasters? In the end, apparently, two characteristics stand out. (1) Continual updating of forecasts, (2) Being intelligent. That fact is told after around 200 pages of tedious writing. Wtf? I can reluctantly accept dumbing down the book, but it is inexcusable that the footnotes does not include some further help to the reader that wants more depth.The author likes to give minute details of the superforcasters. Personally, I don't care that Brian likes Facebook updates of cats, that John is retired because he is sick and that he now likes to collect stuff or that Steve is and old colleague of the author that likes opera. Who reads and enjoy this written muzak? It goes on chapter after chapter. We ""meet"" 15-20 superforecasters.There is a lot about the superforecasters in the book, but the title of the book is ""Superforecasting"". This is a seriously misleading title. It makes you believe that you will learn tools to become a great forecaster. You get some, mostly general, points in an eight page appendix. With the researcher's experience, I would have expected a lot of practical advice.What is good about the book?(1) The key message that experts are lousy forecasters and do not want accountability is very important, but that was already in the author's earlier book.(2) Some useful anecdotes that you probably should pick up if you are teaching/presenting on the topic.(3) Odd bits of information. I liked the discussion of how the German military used what we consider modern management already 100 years ago. As mentioned earlier, there are 50 pages of really good material in the book.I bought the hard-cover edition. If you make notes with a normal pencil, be careful because it easily pierces the paper.The book is worth two stars. If you are en educator and want a few anecdotes, read the book. Others should give it a pass. Instead sign up to the author's forecasting tournament. You learn more by trial and error learning. I signed up two years ago and it is a useful experience. You can also check the video features on edge.org. Then spend time reading better books. A few rigorous pop-science books:* Another forecasting perspective is Steenbarger's Trading Psychology 2.0: From Best Practices to Best Processes (Wiley Trading). It is about trading in the market, but it covers many of the topics from a different perspective. Worth reading his earlier books too.* And if you haven't read Thinking, Fast and Slow, that is a more important book (but also too fluffy for my linking).* You should also read Taleb's The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: ""On Robustness and Fragility"" (Incerto), but don't buy his fluffy version of the same topic Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets (Incerto)","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QPFHWVXRB51Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804136696#wasThisHelpful","R1QPFHWVXRB51Z","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an awful book. Porter's diamond model is presented (originally in ""Competitive advantage of nations"", 1990). Focus of the current book is  Alan Rugman's critique of the model from a Canadian perspective. The basic critique is that Canada sells a lot to the US so it is impossible to have a Canadian cluster.The authors do not seem to have an opinion on the critique. Instead they just report what other people (mainly Rugman) have said. Useless. I would welcome a general critique of Porter's model, but I would expect the authors to provide the general critique. Naturally, they should refer to Rugman's critique, but it should not be a main focus of the book. I am not familiar with any general critique of Porter's national/cluster competitiveness mode.

"Two years ago, the author killed himself in a French cathedral so that people would realise that the Western culture has to be invigorated. That is clearly an act of lunacy, but it could make for an interesting author. Sadly, it did not.The book is a write-up of a set of interviews conducted by a journalist (update: conducted by the author himself - wtf?). The interviewer hardly ever asks follow up questions. So most of the book is superficial. Here is some of the topics covered: biographical details, author's inspirational writers, the assassination attempt of Hitler, nobility and sacrifice for the nation, suicide as a political statement, Homer as the origin of European civilisation, the negative tendency towards abstraction in Western thought.Sadly there is no depth in the book. Let me still highlight a few ideas that I found very interesting. I am not convinced about their accuracy, but I would have been willing to listen to the author's arguments.- After the Second World war, Europe was divided by the US and the USSR. What we think of as Western values are in fact US values. European history was deep frozen during the Cold War, but has begun to move again.- Europe's crisis is existential because Europeans have lost touch with their roots. Those roots are the pre-Christian roots, in particular Homer's writing. The fashionable new ideology of humanism (i.e. we are all the same) is a key problem. The ideology is not grounded in identity (e.g. nation, land, blood). A parallel is made between the two world wars and the opium wars in China. In both situations a great civilisation was paralysed and destructive for several decades.- Christianity made people false because they started to say that they loved their enemy, but in reality, of course, no such love existed. This has created a weakness. The weakness is getting stronger because the Christian church has lost all connections with the more truthful pagan culture after the Second World War.- European culture is unique because it has given women a large social presence since antiquity.- There was a European community among the ruling nobility in the 19th century. It was democratisation in the early 20th century that led to national hatred and the First World War.A lot of ideas seem to come from Metamorphoses of the City: On the Western Dynamic so you might want to read that book instead. Update: I bought the book and tried to read it. It is difficult so on second thoughts you might abstain.None of the author's books have prior been translated to English. I do not understand why the publisher chose to translate this book. (Update: See conversation with publisher in comments.) It can hardly be the author's most interesting book. The author must already have been mad when writing, because he seriously thinks that suicide will make people listen to him. While I appreciate the publisher's effort to introduce the author to an English-speaking audience, I seriously question the choice of book to translate. Is it really the author's best book? I doubt it. I will give the book two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPTNR7T6INWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910524441#wasThisHelpful","RCPTNR7T6INWP","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book highlights a number of tools to think better. There is a whole cottage industry around this topic. Instead of this book, you should pick up Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Thinking, Fast and Slow. After reading those books twice you will be skilled to make informed choices about other books. The current book is extremely shallow, and sometimes even wrong in the details.If you are not convinced, let's look at one of the tools; opportunity costs. Do you know what it is? If not, buy this book and you will learn something. Do you know what it is, but want to have some twists and deeper understanding? If yes, do not buy this book. This illustrates my main problem with the book. It is only scratching the surface. An intelligent book would have presented the tools, but then provided more advanced material to readers that are more knowledgeable. This book does nothing of the sort. It stays fully connected to the simple, beginner's level.Furthermore, the book is so politically correct. After the discussion of opportunity cost, he brings up marriage. If two people have drifted apart, the past is a sunk cost and should not be taken into account when deciding on a divorce. Oh no, according to the author, marriage is good because people have learnt about each other in the past. That is important for the future and thus the couple should not divorce each other. Wtf? Maybe there actually is a problem with the notion of opportunity cost that the author could have explored. Sadly, the book never reaches that level of depthOne more example: The author rightly point out that controlled experiments are the gold standard in research. He then moves on to trash regression analysis without really understanding that controlled experiments are not possible in many areas. He keeps coming back to controlled experiments being the gold standard. He says nothing about most psychologists doing controlled experiments with 20 year old college students; as if a silly (but clever) experiment could be representative for all of humanity. Again, the book lacks depth. And the author manages to be politically correct again. He claims regression studies have shown that diversity officers have not impact on diversity. He then tells a just-so story to save his cherished diversity-is-good viewpoint. (I can go into detail what is wrong with his thinking, but this is just a book review.)The book is an awful attempt to make a quick buck by a psychology professor. There are some good points in the book, but if there are so many much better books, why buy this one?

"In a book about religion the author starts with a pet project about group selection. Most experts would agree that group selection is possible, but rare or non-existent in practice. So the author gives us a fictitious example of group selection. So what? Show us real-life examples instead. The book does not improve. We get a lot of interesting ideas about religion, for instance that it can be seen as a trade with a supernatural being for some goods (e.g good harvest, eternal life). The author is a professor, but I get the strong feeling of a happy amateur: ""Here are some things I've read about topics that could be related to religion. Let me tell you about it"". Nothing wrong synthesising other people's work, but it has to be done in an interesting manner. Here is a man with a hammer, that just keeps hammering.

"The author is known for inventing his own terminology and writing overly complicated books (e.g. Hypercompetition). However, he is one of the few academics that actively thinks and writes about competitive advantage with some rigor. Compared to his earlier books, this one is very readable. He keeps the new terminology to a minimum. The book is built around a product quality/price chart. Three types of commoditization are described and solutions are discussed.So much for the good stuff. Sadly, I find many of the examples lacking detail:* Zara is supposed to have lower prices than H&M. That is simply not true.* Apple is supposed to sell its iphone as a lower price than competition. Also not true.* Aspartame is apparently off patent, The manufacturer keeps the price higher that for the new generation sweetener (Splenda), because there are high (undocumented) switching costs. Switching costs between branded and generic aspartame?I don't think the sloppy examples impact his theory that much, because it is really standard industrial organisation (e.g Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance). All the examples are probably coming from student projects and executive, without any detailed quality control. The author is thanking more than 50 CEOs in the acknowledgements. I guess he is pitching for teaching assignments.I don't know if the author really has invented the quality/price chart.

"I am writing this after having read two thirds of the book.The book has been compared to Tom Clancy's Hunt For Red October, but that comparison is really silly (unless you're the publisher). Tom really knew how to write. Tom also had respect for and knowledge of the enemy. The story is okay, but the execution really pulls the story down. The authors' lack a proper command of writing and storytelling. The book almost pulls you into its story a couple of times, but then it just lets go of the reader. Later in the book, the authors do not even try to pull you in. The narrative jumps from scene to scene like a film script. In the middle of an exciting section, who wants to jump to ten pages about a not yet introduced person's family life? Moving between a big strategic narrative and a small personal narrative have just been used too many times. At one point the story moves forward a couple of months/years(?), but we are not told. So we need to make sense of the words as we go along. Tom Clancy would never have used this kind of narrative.Furthermore, the authors manage to insult both the Chinese and the Americans. The Chinese are wooden and start a war without any major reason. Wtf? The Americans on the other hand always care about the individual and always save one soldier even if it leads to defeat in the battle. So the Chinese are stupid and the Americans are pathetic.The book is pandering to 2015 politically correct values. We get a gay commander and a black analyst that isn't taken seriously. America is stuck in the mother of bureaucracies and wastes most of its military budget. It is okay to have a message, but please don't make it so obvious. So much for being set in the future. The future is only present with some super-duper innovations, like a Swiss cream that magically removes all scars or the next version of Google Glass that can do anything.UPDATE: After having read the whole book it is worth 0 stars.

"This is a light and funny book, but you will learn something new. Apparently the first book in a trilogy. The social habits of old-moneyed Chinese from the former British colonies (Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia) are described in detail. Of course it is fiction so everything is a bit exaggerated. Or maybe it isn't. The author claims that he actually toned down some sections because he wanted the book to be believable. You will also learn some swearing in Chinese dialects, like dog s*** westerner or smelly c**t.The book is great, but I deduct one star. The two main characters are university professors, but are flat as cardboard. Clearly the author is better at penetrating the minds of rich Chinese than university professors. The two professors are also ethnic Chinese, but I feel the author has written the book as if they could be western as well. Maybe the author is eyeing for a Hollywood deal requiring at least one western lead actor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJD33UKBMZPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345803787#wasThisHelpful","R2PJD33UKBMZPL","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The recipes are mostly home cooking style; like back in the days when wives were housewives. Nothing wrong with that, but I want to set your expectation right. I have started with the ceviche recipes and they recipes are interesting; for instance by grinding shrimp heads into a paste. You'll also find loads of less trendy dishes like chicken liver and bull testicles.The book was probably written for a domestic audience and then translated with a great amount of arrogance towards the reader. There is no section describing the general cooking methods and underlying principles. Clearly ceviche is fairly unique for Peru and should have been described in some general terms, e.g principles behind a great ceviche. We do get four pages describing some of the unique ingredients. That is good, but fare from enough.Let me be specific with my critique:* There are many unexplained terms. We get tiradito recipes and cuasa recipes. Am I the only idiot not knowing these terms?* We are told to use a Peruvian mortar. So how is that different from a normal mortar? I guess no difference, but, then, why not just call it a mortar?* Recipes are not clear about details. Most ceviche recipes call for 20 small limes (the 1/2 inch kind???). Clearly this cannot be normal limes. So what is it? Sometimes we should use small lemons. That is a product I have never come across before.* We are told to use culantro or cilantro. Wtf? A simple googling finds out that culantro is similar to sawtooth found in some Asian markets. Why the lack of explanation? How hard can it be to check the latin name and actually provide a useful service to the reader.There book has loads of recipes and with the help of google you will do very well with this book. However, I would expect more from a book. The book is written by a famous Peruvian chef and I would have expected PASSION about the Peruvian cuisine. Instead the book if full of ARROGANCE towards the reader, by assuming we already know Peruvian cuisine. For these serious flaws the book is not worth more than three stars. Three is is extremely generous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CD3ZUHZRN1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0714869201#wasThisHelpful","R27CD3ZUHZRN1F","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The marketing of the book is false. I quote from the description: ""study of the identitarian movements presently reshaping the contours of European politics"". (Note the plural -s.) It is better to describe the book as an overview of Benoist's GRECE during the 1970s to early 1990s. GRECE is a French, radically culturally conservative network of scholars. The book is about the philosophical underpinnings. Just to set the potential buyer's expectations straight.There is much interesting material in the book, but it is very uneven. Frankly it is shocking that so little of Benoist's work (and others in the group) have been translated to English. In fact, more has been translated into German than into English.) Unfortunately, some chapters and sections are lucid and clear, but others are turgid and obtuse. Let me give an example: The beginning of the Archeofuturism chapter is very clear, but the second half is awful. First you must be familiar with Nietzsche's Eternal Return and Heidegger's Dasein. You also need to be familiar with the jargon of using foreign words that are supposed to convey a clearer meaning (e.g. Geist, logos, Heraclitean flux, pace (latin meaning), polemos,) The author is neither Nietzsche nor Heidegger. He is supposed to make the topic clearer than in the original for the benefit of us mortals. He fulfills this role in about 70% of the book, but fails in the remaining sections. Still that is an acceptable ratio.If you are interested in European geo-politics, this book is very valuable as it provides a non-Anglo-Saxon perspective on Europe. And if you belong to the English speaking (left-wing) crowd that loves to label the ideas neo-fascist, you owe it to yourself to read some of the original work. If you cannot speak French you could at least read this book in English. It is striking that there is hardly an Anglo-Saxon thinker mentioned in the book. Agree or disagree with the New Right, it is refreshing to the mind to get a different perspective. Of course one could argue that Communitarianism has several things in common with the New Right. Anyway I'm digressing.The book is from 2013, but that is also false because it is an unchanged second edition. Don't you hate it when an author states that he refrains from doing any changes, when it is blatantly obvious that he does not want to do the work needed for a revision? The author had a golden opportunity to further clarify difficult sections and tell us something about GRECE in the almost 20 years. There is very little information available in English, so I wish the author would have felt the responsibility to update the material.With an update, the book would be worth five stars. Now it is a four star book. Finally, here is better book on the same topic Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3APKBRM1IMRYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907166890#wasThisHelpful","R3APKBRM1IMRYC","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That is a summary of the author's life.His images and associations manages to express a fundamental truth in a very unexpected manner. The author probably got a well-deserved Nobel Prize four years before dying. However, don't expect that most poems are like the ones you have seen quoted. In fact, most of them are pretty difficult to understand. There is a very useful introduction in the beginning, but it is not enough.

"This book is part of Penguin's new series of European history. Do not think for a second think that you can pick it up and understand something about European history between 1517 and 1648. You need to have a basic understanding of the period before you might get any benefit from reading the book.(Or possibly a photographic memory and a super-brain so you remember everything and then make sense of all the facts in your sleep.)One major problem is that the author seems to hate history as a time line. What happened when? What were the watershed events? It is naturally there, but does the author really have to make the chronology himself? The author likes to tell small stories about religion, gender politics, etc. In my view, one needs to go from broad themes to narrow facts. I suppose the writing style is kind of postmodernist. There should be no privileged narrative so we get topical chapters instead. And why use a boring linear perspective on time? Let us a spherical concept of time instead.Please also note that most five star reviews seems to be truly fake. It is either the author trying to boost sales or somebody else. If you do not believe me, please check out the reviews on the UK edition of the same book (Christendom Destroyed: Europe 1517-1648 (Allen Lane History) (Bk. 5)) before somebody whitewashes them with glowing, one line, five-star reviews.The book is part as a general series on European history. Penguin seems to have massive problems getting the manuscripts from the assigned authors in time. The series is already massively delayed. That is not likely to lead to high quality results. The current book fails miserably. I cannot give it more than one star.

"The author is totally in love with himself and his prose. Here is an example of his writing: ""their first successful leaf, twirling in the Cavern darkness, had led to this--this pale, lentil body turning in his mind's dark. This scapular profile, these tow-line braids. Her hips fell somewhere on the LimaÃ§on of Pascal. The squares of her breasts' abscissas and ordinates summed to an integer. This was the math of women, a field he'd given up studying, female equations whose complexities had long ago surpassed his ability to differentiate"". What on earth is he trying to accomplish? Some reviewers have commented that this is like poetry. Fine, if you like reading such poetry, you will love this book. Personally, I find his style extremely belaboured. Nothing flows freely. Everything is designed. I can see the author browsing the web to find obscure linkages to embellish his text with.I wish he would be in love with story-telling and his readers instead. In the first thirty pages of the book a woman gets a job at a high-tech company. That is it. Unless you get a kick out of reading difficult prose, you should give this book a pass. The book is all style over content. It all feels totally fake.

"This is a vastly superior book to Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate by the same author. The topic is similar; how to get companies to experiment more.

Hence the importance of experimentation.Naturally, the author overstretches. This author is a one trick pony and he dismisses the importance of ideas all to easy. His dismissal of ideas is awfully stupid. Primitive arguments like this flourish in the book: Good ideas that are not implemented are not useful. Hence, ideas are not important. This infantile logic will disturb some of his readers. Dumb ideas that are implemented - I wonder how the author would explain such a situation. In fact, the author proposes an idea called experimentation.Anyway, I like the book. You do not read the book for the author's intellect, but for his practical experience.

"Had Alexander Bard been Brit or American, he would have been a world famous futurist. Now he is a Swedish jack of all trades; gay activist, composer and musician, and futurist. He knows how to annoy and provoke to a level with which Americans are uncomfortable. For instance bragging about being a gay prostitute in his youth is not endearing him to anyone. However, behind the surface lies a very interesting thinker. He is not a very structured thinker. It is more like he has a pulse on the future. A good observational eye. A student would hate to summarise this book because it is all over the place. That is mostly a strength, but also a weakness. The book is for instance far too long. (He also has a coauthor. I don't know anything about him.)Here is one paraphrased statement: ""What a 40 year old does not understand is that for a 20 year old the online word is the real world. Already. The interesting issue is how the young will rearrange the physical world? They seem to come together to play."" You could argue that this is obvious fluff. However, if you are a politician or a businessman, chances are that you have not thought enough about the issue. Removing the tablet from your small child might not be sufficient. Dealing with cyber-addiction in 10-20 years time might be essential. Journalists and writers have a few things to pick up from the book as well.

"Honestly speaking, there is not much additional material in the third edition. The author has included his Nobel Prize lecture together with and some smaller additions. All the charts are updated, but they are continuously updated on his webpage anyway. The academic references and so on has not really been updated, so that makes the book somewhat dated.If you have not read the earlier editions, this is a must read book. Furthermore, some books are worth rereading. So if you bought the second edition I would still recommend that you buy the third edition. It is good to be reminded of bubbles from time to time. Below I am appending my review of the second edition.REVIEW OF SECOND EDITIONEconomists have until rather recently refused to pay attention to emotions (driven by culture and psychology). Well by now, some cutting edge researchers have studied these phenomena for 20 years, but it is only during the last 10 years that these ideas have had any mainstream impact. And writing in 2011, I would say that these ideas do not yet have any major, systematic impact on economic and finance thinking.This book is a book written by an economist who have realised the importance of these ideas for some time. The core question in the book is to try to understand the non-economic factors in society that create asset price bubbles. The book is well written and its author is aware of all the research done in the area. Off course the original edition was published in 2000 so the research has moved on and I would not consider the book cutting edge any more.Still, I am not aware of any better book on the subject and I would consider this book a must read. Be sure to get hold of the second edition from 2005. Given the success of the predictions in the book I would not be surprised if we see a third edition. There are still bubbles waiting to burst (government bonds in the US, property prices in London, etc.). Still, a third edition is probably not shortly forthcoming given the fact that we are not really in a bubble economy in the US. So get hold of the second edition and read it.The author has a more recent book called Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism (New in Paper). In my mind that book is vastly inferior to the older book. The more recent book deals with irrationality in economic behaviour in general, not just in financial markets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGUZX1S3F28E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691166269#wasThisHelpful","R3IGUZX1S3F28E","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lafley has written xxx, which is similar in that it covers the same time-period as the current book. That must be the only CEO who has written about his experience twice. The current book is the best written book. It flows very well and brings up a lot of insightful anecdotes. The other book follower more a formula. I happen to like the formula too, but it is less satisfying if you are interesting in what P&G did during Lafley's first stint as CEO. (As you might know, he is out of retirement back for a second stint.) I would recommend this book if you are more interested in P&G and the other book if you are more interested in business strategy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHMLAWX69HE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307381730#wasThisHelpful","RBHMLAWX69HE5","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were two management classics written in the 1990s. This is one of them and it should be read by anyone interesting in innovation, strategy, and equity investing. The book is not difficult but it is also not an easy read. It requires some focus and deeper thinking. The author has written several subsequent books on the same theme with his MBA students at Harvard. However, the first book is the only book based on research and then only one worth reading.

"This book believes that branding is the most important part of business strategy. The book is mostly a collection of case studies of companies successful around the year 2000. So whatever they do it is successful. The author totally fails to understand that these companies can crash even when their branding is perfectly executed, for instance due to the strategies of competing firms. Many of the companies described in the book have not turned out well. The book is neither interested in trying to understand nor has a framework making understanding possible.

"If you can bear the dumbed down language that university textbooks use today, this is a good book. The author is a Christian, but the book is a fairly objective description of the facts surrounding the bible.  But be aware, textbooks are not for the fainthearted. They contain page after page of unnecessary filler material. Quite annoying. Finally, the publishers of textbooks typically put very low quality covers on the book. This is so the book looks really used even before it is being read. This is to discourage students to resell their textbooks. This particular book has the the thinnest softcover that I have ever seen.Each chapter has references but they have generally not been updated for the last 7-8 years. That is another miss.Just a question to the author: Some Jew removed the mark of circumcision so they could pass as Greek in the bath houses.

"This is one of the most poorly structured books I have ever read. The basic idea is that prototyping is important and how you do the prototyping will influence the outcome. Make a car prototype in clay and it will be slow but the shapes will be rounded. Make the prototype in the PC and it will be faster.One key problem with the book is that it is rambling on and on without any clear structure. There are interesting ideas, but they are never pursued. A lot of the book is just meaningless filler material, but then you find some interesting and thoughtful nuggets of information. I wonder who these people are that give the book five stars? The author's students, if he is a professors? It really makes me wonder about the quality of reviews on amazonI honestly cannot recommend this book. The author has interesting ideas, but they are not developed yet. He has another book out and I will take a look at it.UPDATE: The author is really a one-trick-pony and has now written a book InnovatorsHypothesis about the same topic. The new book is worth reading.

"Customer loyalty matters greatly for profitability according to the author's first book, The Loyalty Effect: The Hidden Force Behind Growth, Profits, and Lasting Value. Read it! It is a good book. This book, in contrast, contains nothing novel.The title of the book refers to the question ""would you recommend company x's products?"". Oh, what suspense. For 20+ years, academics have known it is a better question than to ask about customer satisfaction or customer repurchase likelihood. However, you do not need a whole book to make this conclusion. Unfortunately, the author does not have much in terms of elaboration. Instead the book is full with the old boring examples: USAA, Southwest, Netflix, Schwab, etc. Many of the examples are from the 1980s. What about some fresh examples? The 2.0 additional to the title is purely for cosmetic reasons.Sadly, the book is not worth more than two stars. It would have been a great article of 10 pages. In the afterword the author is saying that he will publish much more on the topic. It is likely to be another empty book. The author's first book was great because he had something to prove; now he just has something to market.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP342RYQ2A8BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422173356#wasThisHelpful","RP342RYQ2A8BA","A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me just tell you right here from the beginning, when I found out that Miro and Ian were getting more books it made me one happy Diva. With the second installment of the Marshal series readers get to go along for one wild ride with Ian and Miro as they figure out exactly where they are in their togetherness while trying to stay alive long enough to make sense of all those proclamations they make.At this point in Miro and Ianâ€™s lives theyâ€™ve been together for about six months. They are living and working together and still having some amazingly hot nights together. Fit to be Tied is just as hot as All Kinds of Tied Down. They are very much in love and each and every single one of their actions shows that to their readers. Miro wants to take further steps in their relationship and Ianâ€™s questioning is making Miro question the decisions theyâ€™ve made thus far. Reading these two strong alpha males who are very much head over heels for each other go through all the insecurities of a new relationship made for some intense reading. The reader in me wanted to smack them with their own book to get them to see the amazing thing they have.The romantic suspense element that Mary Calmes brings to the pages is fairly intense. A violent criminal from a past case finds his way into Miroâ€™s present in a very sick and twisted way. I would have LOVED some of those pages to be from Ianâ€™s point of view. Readers are there with Miro for this horrific ordeal. The days following are some real eye openers for Ian and Miro.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T04A42RUJO3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014V4EDHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2T04A42RUJO3O","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Going in to Bane I was expecting the dark and dreadful circumstances of this world. Juggernaut and Strain have thoroughly prepared me for that. Bane is just as grim but there is finally a little bit of light at the end of this post pandemic tunnel. Amelia has brought the characters from Juggernaut and Strain together in this installment. Together they will put everything they have up  against the people that are continuing to bring what little is left of the world down.The threads that were left unresolved with the other books in this series have been woven together and wrapped up quite nicely. Nothing of the resolution seemed rushed, too simple, or convenient. The suspense of how things could possibly work out held to the very end. Everything within the pages here seemed completely plausible and made perfect sense for this world.Everything that Delta Company, and Zach and Nico come up against has been so dismal. Zach and Rhys come together under circumstances that neither wants to be in yet both know it is for the greater good of mankind. Darius and the rest of Delta Company do what they have always done and protect what is theirs, even when letting go of Rhys for the short amount of time that they must goes against everything they believe in. They see the good that Rhys can do for what is left of the population and hope that Zach wants what he claims to.All of this makes for one amazingly intense read that will stay with you long after youâ€™ve finished reading it.Favorite quote, Zach to Nico: â€œWe lost ten years to this.â€book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394Q19HZIZRNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M2FBI6#wasThisHelpful","R394Q19HZIZRNI","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A horney heart surgeon walks into a barâ€¦ No, seriously thatâ€™s exactly what Jason does on Abeâ€™s birthday. Heâ€™s looking to blow off a little steam while getting sweaty with someone sexy. This is Jasonâ€™s life. Heâ€™s been having tons of random meaningless sex since his divorce five years ago.Abe is hanging with his friends at their favorite bar on his birthday when he decides to take the sexy man who just propositioned him up on his offer for some hot no string sex. Abe typically doesnâ€™t do one offs but decides to go ahead and take Jason home. Neither one of them expected the one night to become two, then three, then once the momentum gets to really moving these two find themselves in a relationship while playing house with a family.The unexpected relationship that Jason finds himself in turns out to be the best thing to happen in his life. Jason sees his failed marriage as proof that heâ€™s just not relationship material. His one night only thoughts that he has no problems expressing can make him appear like a using jerk. Upon first glace Abe seems like a pushover for letting it happen, repeatedly. Then you get into reading this very sexy yet really sweet love story while watching these two men fall in love and you realize there is so much more to them and their courtship. It all works for this story. Abe is so laid back and easygoing. Itâ€™s the perfect contrast to Jasonâ€™s whorish arrogance.My only disappointment was the conflict that was introduced. There is something in Jasonâ€™s life that he has never thought about mixing with his extra curricular activities. A problem arises and it brings those into his life with Abe. Thereâ€™s an issue that could be a serious stressor to their relationship. It was mentioned, it caused a problem, then we went to the happily ever after epilogue. How to fix the problem was touched on, barely. It needed more resolution. I realize we needed a bit of conflict, but that needed a little expanding on.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOM33UGN5R8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6BO6KE#wasThisHelpful","R1HOM33UGN5R8W","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are entirely too many things to list about the Restoration series that are stay away from for me. I do not read addicts, EVER. I donâ€™t care for suicide or recovering addicts either. A.M. Arthur puts these things in her stories in a way that works for me. It fells real and often reflects what I know. Taking a Chance is the third and final book in this series. I recommend reading them in order. Elliott is introduced in Getting It Right when the family/friends corral at the hospital due to Elliottâ€™s fiancÃ©â€™s deadly car accident. Readers then get to see Elliottâ€™s downward spiral filled with sex, drugs, and self-hate in Finding Their Way. Taking a Chance is Elliott and Augustusâ€™s story and itâ€™s amazing.I love reading a hot mess. Elliott and the time in his life he is trying so desperately to come back from is exactly that. Elliott is trying to pick up the pieces, put them back together, and carry on with his life. He has an amazing network of friends that are his family behind him offering every type of support he could possibly need. The only thing he misses is his sex life, but after the disastrous relationship that destroyed his heart heâ€™s almost positive that he isnâ€™t missing that until he spots the construction guy Augustus.It was just supposed to be a simple kitchen renovation job. Augustus has done them before and heâ€™ll do them again. Nothing out of the ordinary here except that his exâ€™s other man is looking very sexy in the next room. The chemistry is there from the very first meeting. Auggie knows itâ€™s a bad idea. The problem here is that the more time he spends around Elliott the more that he wants more time to spend with him, get to know him, explore that attraction (and body), and see where this can go considering it has a no where chance from the very beginning.I could not put this book down. It is overflowing with so many emotions. The entire time I was reading this it was nail biting anxiety while I impatiently waiting for it to come out. There is an elephant in this book that can only tear the room apart once it becomes known.

"When someone asks what my favorite paranormal romance series is I alway mention Larissa Ioneâ€™s Demonica series as one of the my top five favorites. I donâ€™t read nearly as many paranormal romances as I once did. When I saw that there was a new one coming out and that it would be a male male romance I knew I just had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. Nothing shocking here but I absolutely loved it.Having read the other Demonica books I knew what to expect out of the Seminus demon. Raze has to have lots of sex to survive. That sex has to be had with a female. Raze does what he has to do to survive but all he really wants is to feel the connection and passion that can only be experienced with a lover, a male lover. Heâ€™s resigned himself to life of emotionless sex with a woman who is simply helping him survive. Razeâ€™s story screams heartbreak and I had to know how Ione was going to see him get his happily ever after. I love how she made it work. Slake bought something new and interesting to the series.Find the target, apprehend them, and turn them over to his boss. That is Slakeâ€™s job. It has been his job for a long time. It is a job that he has excelled at. It is also the one thing that allows him to keep his soul. His last job though has turned out to be anything but typical. Heâ€™s found the female he is supposed to take into custody. Slake canâ€™t seem to take his mind off of her very sexy friend long enough to care why he is supposed to be nabbing her. He wants Raze in a way that he has wanted no other before. Putting job, species, and logistics of how to make the impossible work aside Slake and Raze may have found something they never thought existed.Base Instincts easily works as a stand-alone. There are a few characters from the Demonica and Lords of Deliverance series that have some small roles here but nothing that would allow a reader to get lost in an world they have never read.book received from the publisher for the purposr of an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19WQWR0WKH5TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162649309X#wasThisHelpful","R19WQWR0WKH5TQ","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I skimmed so much of this novella. I LOVE the Midnight Breed books. I love the world. It is always fascinating and intriguing. Tempted by Midnight, Lazaro and Melena, not much to be intrigued or fascinated by. I was very disappointed in this read.Lazaro runs the Order headquarters in Rome. Itâ€™s where he ran off to and buried himself in work as he grieves for the loss of his family and their Darkhaven. For twenty years has not let anyone get close to him. His work for the Order is what he lives for. It is what has brought him to a yacht in the middle of the ocean where a secret peace meeting will happen with a Breed GNC (Global Nations Council) member and an Italian human political leader.As her fatherâ€™s personal assistant Melena is used to going to various GNC meetings with him. As a Breedmate she is used to using her extrasensory ability to determine attitudes and dispositions. The oceanic yacht meeting puts her face to face with the Breed male who saved her life when she was a mere child. The hero worship is strong here. The fact that they have both savored this connection was creepy. It is part of the older than time man falling for the woman he has known since she was a child that didnâ€™t work for me.The other thing that didnâ€™t work for me with Tempted by Midnight was Melena. Her immediate desire to have a blood bond with Lazaro made absolutely no sense. Her reaction and behavior when she discovers heâ€™s found a blood host to feed (heal his massive wounds) from was childish, appalling, and made her look very insecure. I think her behavior was supposed to appear as pointing out all of the faults in Lazaroâ€™s stay alone logic, but it came off to me as irrational. There was nothing about Melena that would make me think Iâ€™d want to spend minutes with her much less thousands of years. Lazaro has a long rough road ahead of him with his happily ever after.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3919K0I4PVM0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H57X85U#wasThisHelpful","R3919K0I4PVM0D","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™ve wanted to know Savannah and Gideon's story since I met them in Kiss of Midnight. Adrian has given readers their story with A Touch of Midnight.A Touch of Midnight takes readers back to 1974. The Order is six members strong and Gideon is part of the fighting although he is very excited about the technological advances he sees coming in the near future. I was giddy right along with him about where the world is going when it comes to computers.Savannah is away from her Louisiana home for the first time in her life. Sheâ€™s attending classes at Boston University. She loves the art history classes she is taking. She seldom uses her extrasensory ability of psychometry to help her determine the history of an object but some items are too difficult to resist. Once she sees the past of a sword sheâ€™s found during an extra credit assignment she canâ€™t resist the temptation to see more. There are others interested in this sword and that soon brings otherworldly creates she never fathomed right to her apartment door.This books works as a nice intro into the Midnight Breed world.

"Going into Bound to Darkness readers are already fully aware of the struggle that is Carys and Runeâ€™s relationship. Due to arguments with her family over Rune, Carys moved out of her family home in Crave the Night. Carys family sees only the surface of Rune. Heâ€™s a cage fighter. Heâ€™s chosen a violent profession. Nothing he does is good enough for her as far as her family is concerned. At seven weeks into their relationship Carys is starting to see that Rune has some deep secrets. This makes her begin questioning why he is keeping her in the dark about certain things.Run from it, hide out of its sight, and bury it. That is Runeâ€™s thoughts on his past. He knows heâ€™s not good enough for Carys. He just wants to keep her for as long as he possibly can. He wants to keep her as his until she figures out what everyone else already has, that he is nothing compared to her. The obvious comes to surface when Runeâ€™s past comes back into his life with a vengeance.I loved how certain aspects tied certain characters together here. It was unexpected. I love it when the characters Iâ€™m wrapped up in do something unexpected or something truly shocking happens in their life. I got that here. I was a bit disappointed in the Opus Nostrum thread. While it is still a big thorn in the Orderâ€™s side I felt that the advancements on that front were minimal. The whole Atlantean war with Selene was barely mentioned. As with every Midnight Breed book I enjoyed Bound to Darkness. I was just expecting more action and more towards to be revealed on the big evil front.Long time fans of the Midnight Breed series will be pleased to know that most of their favorite characters are given a tiny bit of page time here. I find that I want to know more about the children of those characters. I feel that that that information isnâ€™t being given to me quickly enough. I love this series and I want more books now. This is a good thing though. The spin Adrian put on her vampires and the others that she has added to the mix has kept this series moving into new and fascinating places. Adrian has hinted to at least a future couple, if not the next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSVNDJUCQXWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8HFZFS#wasThisHelpful","RCSVNDJUCQXWW","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very apprehensive going into Seduced by Two. Iâ€™ve read a handful of mÃ©nage. I discovered after reading a couple that I donâ€™t particularly care for family members in the mÃ©nage mix. Jensen and Tanner are twin brothers. I decided that I would read them as best friends. That didnâ€™t work out. The twin bond is very present plus both brothers touch on the fact that some see their sharing of lovers as perverse. Julian also writes into the story about how they enjoy sharing women, not each other. All of those factors worked out very well for me and I enjoyed the book very much!  Tanner and Jensen share. They live together, work together and on occasion they enjoy the same ladyâ€™s company for some wickedly erotic hot sex. Nica has just been informed that her time has come to follow in her motherâ€™s footsteps. She must now take over her motherâ€™s role in the Etruscan society. She knew this day would come, she had just hoped she have some more time to enjoy her own life before.  When Nica decides to have her last great night out she never imagined that she would be going home with two extremely hot brothers who guarantee her a night of erotic bliss. This is such a smutacular great read. Jensen and Tanner quickly decide they need more than one night with Nica. Once trouble finds Nica on their doorstep the twins immediately take action to ensure that they protect what they see as theirs.***m/f/m menage***","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OW2LKSO6N3S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014AOJ886#wasThisHelpful","R1OW2LKSO6N3S4","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Romantic suspense, paranormal romance, and male male romance all in one book. Yes, Hell and High Water is an all around win. The main characters Sloane and Dex have an interesting mix of fun and tough. The secondary characters give plenty of entertainment as well. Iâ€™m pleased to see that they are getting larger roles in the later books in the THIRDS series.Maddock to Sloane (about Dex) â€œBut maybe heâ€™s precisely the kind of weird the team needs.â€Maddock knows Dex better than most. He is Dexâ€™s adoptive father. Dex is an odd bird though. Heâ€™s fun, makes jokes often, and tries to make light of most situations. Heâ€™s a good cop though and knows when to take things seriously and get the job done. Being the newest member on the THIRDS Destructive Delta team puts him in the place as an outsider. As that outsider he immediately sees that the team is struggling with the sudden death of the team member he took the place of. The immediate and constant sexual tension between Dex and the deceased team member's lover adds even more complications to an already difficult change.Sloane is one of those super sexy alphas with a past that he doesnâ€™t discuss ever. Iâ€™m looking forward to getting to know Sloane better. He has an interesting story to be told for sure. Heâ€™s not too happy about having a new partner. He still misses his old partner. While Sloane seems like the follow every rule type he broke a major one with his previous partner. They were not only romantically involved, but in love. Dex is in Sloaneâ€™s life as a partner, but the attraction gives Sloane a lot of grief due to it feeling like heâ€™s replacing Gabe in far too many ways.The case that the THIRDS are working on involves individual members of the eight person team in more ways than they realize. Humanâ€™s are dying violent deaths and all evidence points to a Therian killer. The action is intense. I hate that I guessed the who done it so early on but my initial  reasons why were totally off. Iâ€™m looking forward to continuing this series. I can tell already the Dex and Sloane are going to have a very complicated road to a solid happily ever after.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFVN5OG4JTF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLDYYIE#wasThisHelpful","R1BFVN5OG4JTF8","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He has gotten very good at rolling with the punches life throws at him. He knows his past mistakes have caused him some of his problems yet he knows that most of his current troubles come from the curse.Nick to Jem â€œYou need adult supervision.â€Nick may not believe that Jem is cursed but he has seen the solid proof that Jem has the most bizarre events happen around him. That doesnâ€™t stop the detective from pursuing the cute guy from the grocery store. One hot encounter and a memory he wishes he didnâ€™t have of an arrest nine years ago puts the brakes on and has Nick trying to move Jem back to the friend zone.The opposites attract angle worked for Secrets and Ink. I wonâ€™t label Jem as goofy but his character is a bit of a mess. Some of the mess is that of his own creation. The other drama unfolding in Jemâ€™s life is a direct result of some past mistakes. Nick is correct about Jem needing to be supervised. Nick is also more that willing to be that supervisor. The problem is the the strict rule follower knows that there are more reasons to stay away from Jem than there are reasons to seek him out. Attraction wins and makes for a fun and sexy romp through Hollywood.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISX14H3J9VL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIJ8FLK#wasThisHelpful","R2ISX14H3J9VL7","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kara left the only home she ever knew to go to Europe to study the culinary arts. After spending fifteen years away she has returned home to not only restore her Grams beloved cafÃ© to its former glory but to bring new flair and life to its counters and tables. Grams and her bakery was not the only thing Kara left behind so many years ago though. She left her first and only love behind.Max is elated when he discovers that Kara has come back home.

These two lovers soon discover that time apart does in fact make the heart grow fonder. They now have to figure out if the secret from their past can be forgiven and forgotten so that they can get their happily ever after.Hot Fusion is a very sweet romance. Max and Karaâ€™s previous relationship allowed for the whirlwind reconnect not to feel rushed. The rekindle relationship works so well with novellas.

"It has been over a year and a half since I read Strain. It is still one of the darker, grittier books that I have ever read. Juggernaut is the prequel to that dark world. This second (first) book in the Strain series does something that I wish I read more of. Gormley walks her readers through the beginnings and then the fallout that led to the world that her characters are fighting to bring back from the brink of extinction due to a military/government introduced pandemic. I loved reading how the world fell apart. Iâ€™ve already read what the world went to but reading how and why it happened was a true pleasure.Juggernaut is more dystopian, apocalyptic suspense than romance. There is plenty of sex and some of that sex has romance, but no happily ever after, and just surviving another day is certainly the main goal here. Once survival seems obtainable it becomes obvious that the surviving members of the government that caused the problem need to be removed from power and the hows of that are just as fascinating and the hows to everything else in this bleak world.Zach and Nico are the romantic element and they are just heartbreaking to read. They have an against all odds romance that just doesnâ€™t allow for them to get what they want out of what little life they have. They have a ton of guilt for what role they had in the world falling apart. They both want the things that are just not in the cards for them. (hopefully at this time) Mostly they want to survive in this hostile desolate world and protect the only one in it that they love. It makes for a small piece of happy in this gritty tale.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3OZGP0078FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NTSQR8#wasThisHelpful","R2S3OZGP0078FU","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one hot read. I was totally not expecting this book to be as hot as it was. Tristan and Michael get it on, a lot. It was completely unexpected but it worked with their love story. The cover does not scream â€œHot ass read.â€ As much sex as there was in the pages of Crossing Borders I felt that the love that Tristan and Michael found was done into a really sweet love story. The sweet and sexy worked well together. Tristan is younger than Michael, yet very mature for his age. He also has much less experience with men than Michael does. All of this makes for one hell of a good story.The one thing that didnâ€™t really work for me was the denouement. Any good romance needs this. Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s a requirement. Michael and Tristan go together so well and their relationship is running so smoothly for so much of this book I thought this would be one of those books that just doesnâ€™t have a conflict. Then IT happens. They have their mini meltdown. They have a quasi make up. The make up was sex (because that is the one thing they are really good at) with very little on how they will make it work. Then flash forward four years later. I needed a little more before the epilogue.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWI3BZRTRJEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE202W6#wasThisHelpful","R3SWI3BZRTRJEX","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extreme opposites attract meets I know I shouldnâ€™t but Iâ€™m going to anyways. Soren has not been with Tophetâ€™s ATU (anti-terrorist unit) for long. During his short time he has realized that things are really not as they are presented or how they should be. He knows that the roof over his head and the food in his belly should not be taken for granted and he should just tow the line to make sure that those things remain a constant in his life. All that begins to change when he hesitates on a direct order from Command.Live another day. That is how Ace makes it through the days that accumulate into life. Most of the time he does not know where or when his next meal will come. He does what he has to do to make it from day to day. Sometimes he steals, sometimes he roots through trash, he always survives. Survival has become increasingly difficult with the way the ATU who seems to be on a constant extermination mission.All it takes is just one decision and everything in Soren and Aceâ€™s futures is irrevocably changed. Lines are crossed that have dire consequences for both men. Tophet does not tolerate amoral elements and both men are on the wrong side of the morality laws. Neither seems to care when they discover that they are caught up in the middle of something bigger than Tophet, Command, and the territories across the borders.I enjoyed the story. I found the world, its politics, its citizens, and all of its complications fascinating. At the end of the novella I was left wanting more. There is so much mystery and unknown that I was left with questions. Tin Man is part of the Bliss universe and I have not read Bliss.

"You kind of have to feel a bit sorry for Edward. He has been thrown into the life of a Villain unwillingly. To add a bit of insult to that perceived injury he is a Villain without a name. He is still being shown in the media simply as Edward Dinges. His new ability isnâ€™t as Super as one would hope. It leaves him needing meds that he does not have easy access to. Six months into his new (unwanted) life he still has Raul though. There is a silver lining after all. Theyâ€™ve made themselves a home that they love and a life that is theirs. Things really arenâ€™t all that bad.This is Panopolis and nothing can go smoothly or with any nature of conventionality. With the help of Raul, Edward decides to prove himself as a Villain and they plan a heist. The heist turns into a kidnapping and Edward finds himself at the mercy of the newest Villain. Maggot has staked a claim of sorts over Villians and his leadership over the other Villains is forced. Edward has to prove his villainess to Maggot to save Raul.I like where Cari Z is headed with this series. One would think with Supers that Panopolis would be a very safe place to live. Thereâ€™s that something playing in the background that is steadily manipulating both Supers and Villains. I like this. Anti heroes are a favorite of mine. The fact that Edward and Raul are considered Villains in this world even though they are heroes really works for my enjoyment.This is definitely a series that needs to be read in order. The romance is on the mild and sweet side. Panopolis is certainly more super hero action packed than romance.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYSMWMGX9TN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HI0L70#wasThisHelpful","R3JYSMWMGX9TN9","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boxer to Riley, â€œThe past can ambush you if you donâ€™t know to watch for it.â€Two men fresh out of long term yet trying relationships stumbling through a new and instant friendship that unexpectedly leads to more makes for an amazing read. Finding Their Way is a perfect example of that. Boxer had settled into a relationship that kept him mostly happy but not completely fulfilled. That is what put him at the same party where he would end up rescuing another stray. Boxer recognizes Riley from the bar Pot of Gold. Boxer also recognizes that the man is in complete distress and not in full control of his faculties.Hard limits are something that Riley doesnâ€™t have a hard time vocalizing. His boyfriend seeing that as a challenge that heâ€™d do anything to concur puts Riley in a very dangerous situation. Dangerous situations are something Riley is used to and something he has become proficient in avoiding. Riley is still human and wants to be wanted. Heâ€™s tired of people treating him as something disposable. This often leaves him vulnerable to those that would take advantage. Rileyâ€™s time alone taking care of himself has taught him that everything has a price and no one does anything without wanting something in return.Kindness and generosity is something that comes naturally to Boxer. It is ingrained in his. It is how he was raised to be. Offering a helping hand to Riley is a no brainer. Every conversation they have letâ€™s Boxer know that there is something dark and sad in Rileyâ€™s past that has forced him to keep his guard up. Riley soon discovers that Boxer is the opposite of his what he physically appears to be. Trust may not come easy but Riley knows he wants more of everything Boxer has to offer.There are so many things in this book that I absolutely hate to read about and I still loved every single page of it. That has to tell you something awing of the way this story is presented. I do believe that A.M. Arthur is quickly moving to the top of my favorite author list.

"I love a hot mess. It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s the reasons for the relationship, the characters themselves or the lives that are going on around the characters. I love the messy lives that come to life in the pages of a good book. This is one of those. Colin and Riley both are a bit of a mess. Their views on themselves make them an even bigger mess. They could both use a little bit more self-esteem. Colin has just failed college to the point that he is making his last trip home to North Carolina from California. Riley feels that he has failed life. He has embarked on a journey to see and experience different things in hopes that one will make him feel. Colin isnâ€™t in any hurry to get home and the sexy stranger looking for a lift is a perfect way to avoid the inevitable.Good ole boy meets an underwear model straight off of a magazines page. Colin and Riley are complete opposites. They are from completely different backgrounds and heading in vastly different directions. Riley is definitely headed to a different place than Colin. Riley is fully aware of all of his problems. He just doesnâ€™t trust the possible solutions. Heâ€™s perfected hiding the problems and making them seem smaller than they truly are. Colin is new to his life (problems) so he doesnâ€™t notice things for what they are. By the time Colin really sees some of the big issues it too late for him to run. By that point Colin is already head over heels in love with Riley and will do anything for him. Itâ€™s that anything that Riley needs most at that point.Since the author herself pointed this out I feel itâ€™s okay to make the same comparison. Focus on Me reminded me so much of that nineties movie Mad Love with Drew Barrymore and Chris who played Robin at some point. Only this book is much better and so much hotter. Colin and Riley and their road trip of discovery and healing and falling in love is an amazingly good read. Neither one of them is in a place in their life where starting a new relationship is a good idea. The still see it through and make it work. The trying times they go through in the beginning just makes it so easy to see them making through for the long haul.Justin and Landry from Trust the Focus have some unexpected roles here in the second installment of Megan Ericksonâ€™s In Focus series.

"I love visiting new and different worlds in books. I love amazing ones even more. Tempted by Fire deserves five stars for the fascinating world all on its own. There are several different species of paranormal beings to be found in the pages of this book. Dragons referred to as Bloodkin are the main ones. The world is complex and full of secrets and politics that they guard as if it were their own personal hoard.Emerson is learning the politics of her own people as she mediates an argument of who shall get the remains of a woman and child. Two different families are arguing that the remains are in fact that of their own loved ones. Emerson just wants to complete this last task for her employer so that she may move on to other employment options, preferably employment options far away from the Bloodkin.Having to deal with both the Heolstor family and a mediator is more than Thane feels he has time for at this point in his long life. He just wants to finally put his missing loved ones to rest. He can then move on to answering the seductive call of the Night Song. Everything he thought was in his near future is pushed aside as more and more secrets are uncovered with this long ago deeply buried secret.The only concern I had while reading the first book in Erin's new Dragons of Bloodfire series is that it was not a romance. Rest assured lovers of paranormal romance that this is a romance. The romance comes later in the book. The world building takes precedence here. I'm looking forward to where Kellison will go with this series.

"Romantic suspenses are all about the who done it for me. Minutes to Kill is all about will she live and who is really behind all this. Readers know from the very beginning just how evil and twisted Mich and Sam are. We get plenty of page time with them while they are planning their revenge on Hannah. The suspense element here comes from one of their victims and how she unintentionally draws attention to Hannah in her attempt to save her life.Hannah and Brody are good people. They do the right thing for the right reasons. Hannah does the only thing she can do when she sees a young girl running for her life. She tries to help her. The barely failed attempt leaves Hannah injured and the girl violently removed from Hannahâ€™s protection. Hannahâ€™s innate good wonâ€™t let her forget the fear she saw in that girls eyes. She does was any good Barrett would do, she tries to help and keeps digging and making calls and following up with the Vegas PD. One would think sheâ€™s going to draw the wrong kind of attention, but that not where this is going. That attention was acquired in Vegas when she tried to stop the kidnapping.Trouble has come knocking in Scarlet Falls once again. Brody loves his job. He loves it even more when it calls hims to the Barrett house where he gets to see intense corporate lawyer Hannah that grabbed his attention earlier in the year. Being called out to the house in an official capacity is not how heâ€™d like to end up there. Finding out that trouble may end up on her door again is all the more reason for him to keep a close eye on her. It a good thing that keeping her close to him is exactly how he wants things to go because the small town has just became a very dangerous place to be and Hannah seems to be in the center of it.I have to admit there is a scene in this book where I wanted to high five Hannah on her mad skills as a total badass. The Colonel and his field training of his kids may not have been a fun time for his children but he prepared his baby girl for the most traumatic experience of her life. I may have a bit of a girl crush on Hannah.Minutes to Kill easily works as a standalone. The Barrett family that readers meet in the first Scarlet Falls book are still the main characters of this book. This is simply Hannahâ€™s book. The rest of the family has been pushed to the sideline while she gets her very own happily ever after. Fans of the Scarlet Falls world will be pleased to know that Leigh gave her readers an update on Grant and Ellie and their little family.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVP4XG6YN9MY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147782975X#wasThisHelpful","R3GVP4XG6YN9MY","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am so pleased that I read A Matter of Time, Vol 1 at a time where I can immediately dive into Vol 2. If this were not the case Iâ€™m not sure what my rating would be of this book. I do know it would be very low. I go into my romances for the happily ever after. This doesnâ€™t even end on a happy for now. Having read All Kinds of Tied Down I know that Jory and Sam will eventually get their happily ever after. The road that gets them there is obviously going to be one hell of a painful ride. This ends on something that makes me and Iâ€™m sure every other reader scramble to get the next book. So youâ€™ve been warned. Be sure to purchase both books at once.Jory and Sam meet at a rather turbulent time in Joryâ€™s life. Jory is young and still enjoying the energy of his youth. He works, he socializes, and he parties the night away. All of this is set to repeat the following day. Sam is in his mid thirties and a detective. He dates the women that his friends introduces his to. Sam is living the life that he feels people expect of him. Jory is living the life that he wants. They are both happy with their lives just the way they are until the moment they are thrown together due to the crime that Jory witnesses.Iâ€™m personally having a love hate relationship with both Jory and Sam. Sam is an ass. He treats Jory like dirt on the bottom of his shoe half the time and like a special bauble to be worshipped the other times. Jory allows this. Jory is a young hot mess. Dane and Sam both tell him how exhausting he is, with regularity. After Jory witnesses the crime and law enforcement recommends protective custody he declines the offer. Jory is attacked on multiple occasions yet he never really heeds the â€˜lay lowâ€™ advice. Jory walks a fine line on too stupid to live. Throw in the closeted detective that fights his feelings tooth and nail and it makes for a read that is so entertaining that you canâ€™t put it down.Favorite quotes that really sum of the relationship that these two men have.Sam to Jory: â€œCause it would be a helluva lot easier if I didnâ€™t feel like this.â€Jory to Sam: â€œItâ€™s just gonna end badly.

"Say it isnâ€™t so, the final Guardians of Eternity book. Iâ€™ve loved this series from the very beginning. Alexandra Ivy has created a paranormal world that doesnâ€™t just focus on one otherworldly species. She has brought in so many different species that it has allowed for each book to remain fresh and exciting. The various villains have kept that going as well. When Darkness Ends brings together a Chatri princess and a clan chief vampire with the pairing of Cyn and Fallon.Cyn and Fallon meet in Hunt the Darkness. The assignment that the Oracles place upon them is what puts them working together. One of the Oracles realizes that something is not right among them. While there is a pretty good hunch as to what is amiss they need some outside assistance to right the wrongs. Fallonâ€™s royal Chatri blood has given her the ability to scry in a way which most others cannot. The Oracles need this to find out exactly who or what is behind what is going on among them.For a vampire Cyn has been raised (from a foundling) by a different set of parents. It has given him a historical knowledge of species other than vampires. The Oracles know that he can assist Fallon with putting a stop to what is going on with the Oracles. Cynâ€™s top priority soon becomes Fallon. He realizes almost immediately that she is his mate and he doesnâ€™t exactly fight it, his past comes back to bite him more often than not.Fallon and Cyn as a romantic pairing makes for a super sexy read. He respects her and sees her as a female he wants in his life. He treats her like a person. Fallon has spent her whole life being treated as a special object that one must obtain to elevates ones social standing. Fallon has an interesting mix of intelligence, wit, and innocence.Readers who have followed this series from the beginning like me will love that some of their favorite past characters make an appearance while having small roles.

The crew is even receiving emails from the Grand Moth of Agrius, he is seeking a face to face meeting with Elias.Oddly I could have cared less about the Agrius and the mess they bring to the book. Yes it is exciting and brings some tension to the pages but the stin poison in Zander and those ramifications is what kept me from putting this book down. I was all about Zander and what was happening to him. Oh readers, grab that jumbo box of tissues once the Chaos takes its crew to Ashushsk Prime. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m going to say about that. That whole ordeal was INTENSE!Other than the crew heading off to Earth I honestly have no clue where the series is going. I do know that Iâ€™m looking forward to the next one. Iâ€™m sure Zander will experience some new things all things considered. Iâ€™m still left wanting to know more about the Guardians. I was given just enough page time with them again that Iâ€™m still left wanting more.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q21YD6U3QPB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3J2W50#wasThisHelpful","R2Q21YD6U3QPB8","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens in Curacao does not stay in Curacao even though it would make life easier (less pleasurable) for Michael and Sam. On the surface it is easy to see the roles and how they will play out. Mike likes to bend suits over and give it right back to them. Sam is the one in control of everything within the companies that he is bringing back from the brink of failure, he needs to just let go and lose control. This is a constant when Michael and Sam are together, but there is so much more going on. It all tied together for something very sexy with a large side if kink.Michael to Sam: â€œNo title. No last name. The only thing I care about is what you are right now.â€That was all that Mike needed going into his last night on vacation fling. After a week there he had finally found the one thing he had been looking before he went back to work. Work is no longer a happy place for Mike and it hasnâ€™t been for several years. He knows the company is on the cusp of big changes and heâ€™s hoping that the company (its employees and himself) will come out the otherside with little damage.Sam to Michael: â€œNo one has ever made me fly like you do.â€Life as a very successful tough as nails CEO doesnâ€™t allow him to ever remove his mask or come out of the closet. Heâ€™s become used to this life and sadly the company of his hand. Chance encounters like Curacao are rare and his uses those memories to fuel far too many fantasies. So when he sees Michael in the crowded meeting of the company that he is temporarily taking over he nearly loses a tiny bit of that control that hold him together. Everytime he sees Michael he is filled with what-ifs and left desiring something he truly believes a gay man canâ€™t have in the brutal business industry.Iâ€™ve only seen this mentioned in other reviews so please take note that there is a lot of kink going on in Sam and Michaelâ€™s sexual relationship. And it is hot! These two men know exactly what they enjoy and it compliments them both perfectly. It also makes for some hot romance. Michael and Sam trying to get on the same page in life outside of the bedroom makes for some intense reading. They may know exactly what they want in every aspect of their life, but admitting it then acting on it is uncharted territory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQAH0DR0V0H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDD9VEM#wasThisHelpful","R2KQAH0DR0V0H8","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that those who fight falling in the love the hardest fall the hardest. That is exactly what Ivy and Christian have going for them. Ivy believes more than most her life has a short expiration date. She spent years in the hospital, bedridden with an unknown illness. While doing nothing but lying in a bed she witnessed her mother miss out on life while she took care of Ivy. Years later and seemingly healthy Ivy has vowed never to let someone get close enough to her that they would one day have to take care of her.Those vows never to let anyone close has kept Christian from ever having more than a one night stand. He doesnâ€™t want to see the one he loves in danger from the evil paranormal that his family fights on a daily basis. With his brothers recently paired up with the ladies of their dreams he knows that they will carry on the Chiasson name with their children. All he has to see to is protecting the world from the evil that they donâ€™t even know exists and on occasion find a willing woman to warm his sheets. All this seems simple enough until he sees the Hell Hounds that are pursuing Ivy.I giggled and rolled my eyes at Ivy and Christian so much. They were clueless that the love bug had got such a deep bite on them. Christian and Ivy were both fighting the obvious for such similar reasons. They even went into their hot and sexy tryst with a no strings talk before hand. Oh this made for some great tension while they were falling hard and fast. Fate is fickle and she has plans for this couple that get interrupted and derailed by a whole other evil.book provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P1U9SSNDCADD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1FICM4#wasThisHelpful","R1P1U9SSNDCADD","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rebuilding Year has been on my eReader for quite some time. With the next book about to come out in the series I felt it was time to get it to the top of that mountainous to be read pile. The timing on that release is perfect in that Iâ€™m so glad I get to go directly to the next book.There is just so much awesome for my reading pleasure here. I love college boys. Ryan and John are so far from the typical college boys that this made for a very interesting read. I enjoy the gay for you troupe. Once again John and Ryan own their very own unique gay for you romance. Because John and Ryan have to do things their way Kaje Harper manages to work the friends to lover troupe in here too. Throw in two kids (and some of their drama) from a previous marriage and this all adds up to a great read.Bonadventure College in Wisconsin is where Ryan has decided to go to med school, at the age of thirty. Not your typical college boy. An injury has forced him to leave behind his firefighting career. Pride has moved him away from friends and family. He wants a new start to the next stage of his life. Most of his problems lie with the fact that his is a non-traditional student. His roommate is still in full party mode. He believes the girls are too young for him. The bars are too clubby and noisy. The college groundskeeper is the only one he has found that he can engage with in any way.John is still trying to figure out what life has in store for him now that he does not have the title of husband and father. Even though he is still a father his ex has done everything she possibly can to make sure he never sees his two children. He has gone above and beyond in his attempts to be a presence in their lives. He has his job as groundskeeper. He tries to for the positive. Things really begin looking up for him with his steady run ins with a campus acquaintance, Ryan.Everything here is new territory for both of these men. Ryan and John are both straight. They have never even given any other man a second glance. They even notice and point out attractive women to each other when they are out and about. Their relationship goes from casual acquaintances, friends, roommates, best friends, and eventually to lovers at a slow pace that totally works for who they are. Everything in the pages of The Rebuilding Year makes for a remarkably enjoyable love story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW9E3YS4ORSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VY8NEO#wasThisHelpful","R1BW9E3YS4ORSV","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scarlata is folletti, a mythical fairy like creature. She likes her secret existence. She does not wish for any humans to find her or the even bigger secret that she is hiding in the Forest of Hawk Mountain. There is a very specific reason she has snuck into Justinâ€™s cabin. He is a researcher. He is a researcher too close to her and her secret. He is a researcher that wishes to expose her to society. She canâ€™t let any of this happen. As far Scarlata is concerned he must die, now and by her hands. Thereâ€™s just one problem, Justin. She never expected to want to touch him, to seduce him, to do so many other things to his perfect body. What would one taste hurt? Plenty, Justin is not as affected by Scarlataâ€™s magic as he should be and he wants more of what she has already offered!  When Scarlata and Justin finally come up for air they realize there is a bigger problem that Justin stumbling into the forest that she lives in. The company Justin works for sent him there. Justin has always been obsessed with field research, just like his father. He got the drive to find proof of the mythological from his fatherâ€™s stories. Was Justin offered this assignment because of his imagination, his beliefs, or does someone at his company believe he can actually find something in the woods other than wildlife?  What a sweet erotic read this was. Very sexy read with such easily likable characters. I had no idea going into this book that it was set in the same world as What a Goddess Wants. Nortia and Salvatarus are in this book too. You need not read one to understand the other. The two series can be read independently. This is not witch magic, for whatever reason I have just never enjoyed witch magic. The magical element here is the natural magic that the mythical beings carry within themselves naturally. That is another enjoyable factor with this book, the uniqueness of the mythical characters. They are not the same characters you see over and over in so many books. Julian uses the Etruscan pantheon. Itâ€™s certainly fresh and a new variety of beings for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MWY238MOVDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIYNOGC#wasThisHelpful","R38MWY238MOVDT","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heartthrob is the third installment in Mia Watts Hollywood Hotties series. Each book works as a stand-alone. Brett has a small role in each book, but Eddie is a completely new face for the series. As for characters from previous books making an appearance, they are barely even mentioned in this one. So feel safe in going into this book without having read the others.Glitz and glamour and all the jazz of stardom has drawn Brett into the folds of Hollywood. His friend Dar (Ryan Pierce) has helped him get a job as a personal assistant to an actor. Brett is over the moon excited about this. The job opportunity puts him in close proximity of his latest celebrity crush Damon Dexter. Dexterâ€™s own personal assistant Eddie knows what Damon is like behind the scenes. Eddie canâ€™t for the life of him understand why the beautiful Brett would be even remotely attracted to Damon. Eddie was born and raised in LA and completely understands that all that glitz can make even the ugly pretty.As it turned out Brett was a little too flakey to ever really like. Brettâ€™s childishness and his actions that got Eddie into some trouble with his boss just made it difficult for me to understand the attraction. Eddie is responsible and very mature. He was in part responsible for opening the door that allowed Brett to make a wrong decision even worse. The only thing that made sense about Eddie and Brett being a couple was two hotties getting some action in Hollywood.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCZB6T16Z0CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XP84VR2#wasThisHelpful","R2JCZB6T16Z0CW","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance Firebird has the appearance of historical like fantasy world. Cassian is a scribe at the mercy of Monarch Maurus. The characters are dressed in tunics and leggings. The treatment of various individuals automatically sends your thinking to bygone ways. The fantasy aspect is obviously about that winged character. Thereâ€™s a little more going on that kind of gave me a futuristic almost sci fi impression. I enjoyed that unexpected bit.Cassian has been tasked with assisting his Monarch and head of security with trapping a Firebird. As a menial scribe Cassian is baffled. He knows he does not have any tracking and hunting skills to offer in this endeavor. Maurus and his disrespect of human life has no problem explaining how he will be beneficial to this hunt to Cassian. Cassian is the lure, the bait. Not knowing what else to do and knowing refusal is not an option he goes up the mountain in hopes to lure a creature he has never even heard of much less seen.When an unknown person is spotted on his mountain Arturri tries to ignore him. He knows from past occurrences that nothing good can from contact with the inhabitants of this world. Thereâ€™s a small difference this time. The humanâ€™s life is in danger and Arturri canâ€™t simply watch him die. Saving him from the mountainside wildlife Arturri brings Cassian into his home and canâ€™t manage to keep him from his heart.I enjoy something vastly different on occasion and Pelaan delivered just that with Firebird. Arturri and Cassian donâ€™t have an easy go at getting their happily ever after. Maurus has some twisted intentions where the Firebird is concerned. Life as a scribe has not given Cassian the skills needed to get out of the disaster they have been forced into. There are times when the circumstances they find themselves in dire and seemingly hopeless.Favorite quote, Arturri to Cassian: â€œI would wait for you until the sun turned to ash and the stars fell from the skies.â€book provided by publisher for the purpose of an honest review","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GIGC45YQ5K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZ9002M#wasThisHelpful","R4GIGC45YQ5K2","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seduced in Shadow picks up a few months after where Seduced by Magic left off. Ellie, Justinâ€™s sister in now in jeopardy by the Mal. Justin has hired some members of the Fata to watch after her and to be her bodyguards while he and Scarlata have gone into hiding. The de Feo brothers are linchettoâ€™s. They have made a career out of protecting others of their kind. Antonin finds that he enjoys watching over Ellie way too much. He is attracted to her, but he keeps his distance. He takes his job very seriously and wants to keep her out of harmâ€™s way.  While out on one of her early morning jogs she runs directly into the Mal that Antonin has been hired to protect her from.The readers learn a little more about the Mal in this installment of the Magical Seduction series. Antonin has some additional magic that not all linchetto are born with. He has considered this extra magic as more of a curse than a blessing his whole life. It is something he has very little control over and he cannot trust others feelings because of it. That added some tension to his and Ellieâ€™s romance. I enjoyed the new magical beings of the Fata that were introduced in this book. I am truly enjoying the uniqueness of this series. It is not dark, it has a very fresh array of magical beings as main characters, the characterâ€™s abilities are interesting and romance is erotically hot. I am curious about the Mal. What are their intentions, their ultimate goal? I will definitely read more books in this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP7M8XMUO3X4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ004WM#wasThisHelpful","RP7M8XMUO3X4H","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you need to know about Midnight Ride is that Cat Johnson writes amazing cowboy romances. Her cowboys are sexy and real. The gals she creates for them are sassy and fun and just the perfect women for the men she gives her readers. Tyler and Janie are prime examples of this. Some readers will remember Tyler from her Oklahoma Nights series. He is Tuckâ€™s little brother.Young and sexy and full of life Tyler enjoys all things. Heâ€™s a flirt and a charmer and the ladies love him. He knows that one day he will meet his one special lady, the one that he will settle down for but until then he knows how to have a good time and makes sure that whoever he spends that time with has one hell of a time too.Iâ€™m sure Janie never expected the fence mender to be capable of being so much more, something she never expected after having lost so much. Janie is a widow at just thirty-six. She was supposed to grow old with her husband not bury him. Starting over with dating again is something she is not sure about. Dating someone as young as Tyler is just unfathomable to her. It all becomes more than she believes she is ready to handle while hearts are on the line.This first installment of the Midnight Cowboys series was perfect. Tyler makes for a fun read. He knows what he wants, Janie. He is persistent and will do anything to get her. Tyler is such an unexpected in Janieâ€™s life she doesnâ€™t know what to make of him. They both make the other take notice of things that they had been blind to. Tyler loves the settled down domesticity that he experiences while around Janie. Tyler is making Janie experience a time in her life that she initially missed and while it is enjoyable she canâ€™t bring herself to see that it is permanent if sheâ€™ll allow it. Midnight Ride is sweet and sexy and a total page turner.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18A4EQ6LW46S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420136216#wasThisHelpful","R18A4EQ6LW46S9","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ally Blueâ€™s Down was something wholly different than what I expected. Maybe the cover should have been an indicator (itâ€™s rather disturbing and horror like), but there are clearly two men mentioned in the blurb (while there is romantic involvement the situation around the Bathy Tech 3 is clearly the story), and I received the book from Riptide (they do romance mostly). I was expecting romance. What I got was a horror, very creepy horror. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I wasnâ€™t even remotely disappointed that I didnâ€™t get my romantic love story in the end.Armin Savage-Hall and his team of fellow scientists are called to board the Bathy Tech 3 to investigate an anomaly. The team immediately makes correlations to another ocean floor research station and something they found. The speculations begin and never stop. The similarities are obvious yet there is no one to answer any of the endless questions from the other find. Everything unfolds and comes to a head in a little over a week. The questioning of others behavior starts early on, the psychosis soon follows, thus of course bone chilling, blood spilling mayhem is the only option for this tale to go.Miner Mo Rees watches the station he has called home fall into the madness that has infiltrated the minds of the people he has worked with. He witnesses the doctor he wants to get to know better struggle to find answers to the nightmare that has come to be the norm. With every secret that is uncovered more questions arise and the few living people that remain unchanged discover that the impossible is happening right before their eyes.Iâ€™m happy that this futuristic deep sea horror snuck its way onto my Kindle. I like a good scary book on occasion to mix things up a bit.

"Itâ€™s only been a couple of months (for me and other readers) since Eve introduced something new and vastly different into her Cyborgs: More Than Machines series. Avion picks up on that thread and runs with it. The action immediately starts the book as our favorite characters are fleeing the dangers from the ending of Adam.Readers know little of One. The cyborgs know even less about her. They rescued the voice in Avionâ€™s head. She is such an unknown. Iâ€™ve been looking forward to getting to read her. I knew from her abilities in Adam that she was going to be a big game changer for this series. I loved where Eve went with that. One made for a fun read. She is different. Her teachings and torture have given her certain views on things that while funny often show her psychotic ideologies. She looks at everything with scrutiny even though she longs for affection and touch and normalcy.The voice in Avionâ€™s head is now the woman beside him. He knows the connection he has to her is something surreal. He wants nothing more than to explore her and that connection, except to survive. Avionâ€™s nanotech is dead and has left him dying. While things are not looking too good for him and his survival there is one bright spot in short time left, One. Avion has full intentions of making the most out of every second his has with the enigma that has stolen his metal heart.There are so many things to love about this story. One and her growth into a happy woman in love is the best thing ever. All she has known for far too long is a cold empty prison and deprivation of all things. She gets rescued by a dying man. A man that has more metal parts than organic and all he thinks of is her happiness and comfort. This is all so new to her. No one has ever put her first. The only logical thing to do here is to save her hero and their world.*I highly recommend reading Adam before reading Avion*book provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGBIC8CTM86BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPCHWEK#wasThisHelpful","RGBIC8CTM86BC","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Things are changing for the Amsterdam Pride. Kaspar is convinced (though I have no clue why all things considering due to his very non-alpha ways) that he is in line to be named the next leader of the pride. When this doesnâ€™t happen he decides he needs to go out on his own and find greener pastures within another pride. Bath seems like as good of place as any. It doesnâ€™t take him long after his arrival to find everything he needs, a job, roof over his head, and his mate in the form of a geeky sexy university professor.Having his heartbroken and his self esteem squashed Jon isnâ€™t looking for a hookup much less a long term relationship but that is exactly what he finds when he steps into a bar. Jon and Kaspar have immediate chemistry and isnâ€™t long before they are spending more time together than they are apart.I did enjoy all of the things I had to search on the internet. Kaspar and Jon are in Bath. The foods there are so different. Many of their meals introduced me to new tasty treats. I love walking away from a book where Iâ€™m left feeling like my horizons were broadened.I need consistency in my shifter abilities. Kaspar is able to smell his mate, scent freshly dug earth, and smell blood. Kaspar does not have the ability to smell the drugs in his glass of wine. This drove me nuts. The man-lion (yes! This man can shift into a huge powerful lion) that has thrown a fit and fled the country over not being appointed pride leader also awaits his human lover to save him from four unarmed humans and a human wielding a knife.

"Rivvie and Matt have been dancing around a mutual attraction. Matt enjoys the company of women (or so he likes to make others think) so of course he isnâ€™t attracted to Rivvie. Rivvie was raised within a pack that has always been taught to embrace ones sexuality and enjoy it. The human villagers were raised with beliefs of procreate to repopulate the decimated world they live in. The different backgrounds are enough for Rivvie and Matt to keep away from each other. Valen has other thoughts on the matter entirely. He wants to see his pack fully integrated and thriving. His plan to pair humans and shifters for any and every task seems like an easy way to pave the road to a cohesive pack.Once Matt and Rivvie figure out that they can have some fun together they burn the pages of this book up. Matt not only discovers the pleasures that someone of the same sex can offer, but both men discover they tend to like things a little on the rough side. Once they decide to give in and get it on these two really start to get it on all the time.The main characters from Run With the Moon, Valen and Aaron have very large roles in this installment of the series. I was shocked to see just how much page time they got. Valen is still trying to get the pack to see themselves as one, not shifters and villagers. The integration is not going smoothly so this allows for their page time to work without giving the book the feeling that Matt and Rivvieâ€™s page time is being hijacked.I have not read Run With the Moon. In respects of Exodus working as a stand-alone I can honestly say that I was not lost. I was left curious about if there was an explanation there as to what happened to change the world so drastically. Although Iâ€™ve read a many apocalypse type books where readers are just put into a vastly changed world and are left to wonder what has happened along with the characters they are reading.

"The only Hard Ink book that Iâ€™ve read was the previous one. I enjoyed it, but didnâ€™t love it. While reading it I became wildly hopeful that Jeremy and Charlie would get a story. Neither of these men are soldiers of the original group that this whole mess surrounds. They are siblings and victims caught in the crossfire. Iâ€™m sure the Seneka group and the Church group looks at them as a means to an end or perhaps collateral damage. I see them as two men that have built enough sexual tension that desperately need their own book.Hard to Be Good picks up immediately after the end of Hard to Come By. Jeremy is shocked at the damage to his surroundings. He is devested by the loss of lives due to the entire situation that has kept his brother and his teammates in constant danger. The innocents being brought into it keep adding up. Jeremy looks at the many people at his warehouse and wonders if it will ever be over. He also looks at one of the victims with thoughts and desires that are about to be impossible to ignore any longer.It has only been a couple of weeks since Charlie has been rescued from kidnappers and brought into the Hard Ink fold. He is still healing from that harrowing experience. He is also discreet about his sexuality. A lifetime in a home where he was told that was what was wrong with him has stuck. Charlie acknowledges his attraction to Jeremy. Heâ€™s just positive nothing will ever come of it. When one encounter with Jeremy quickly and easily opens the door for more, so much more than he ever dreamed possible he doesnâ€™t know how to handle any of it. All Charlie knows is that he wants it, he wants anything and everything that Jeremy has to offer.I was so pleased that Laura Kaye gave these two men their story. Their opposites attract really worked for me and their tale. Fans of the series will be pleased to know that this series is continuing to move with great momentum. Characters of the past books have small roles as do characters for the future books. I do believe Hard to Be Good could work as a stand-alone.

"There is an interesting flow to the progression of the relationship in this book. Miro and Ian have been partners within the US Marshals Service for three years. During that time theyâ€™ve become best friends. They have a level of trust that has gone beyond unbreakably strong. These men are solid in everything. The only place where they are on different planes is their love life. Ian is straight and runs through women. Miro used to run through men but now that he spends the majority of his time with the only man that he wants he doesnâ€™t have much interest any longer.For a little over half of All Kinds of Tied Down you the reader will be all kinds of tied up over the sexual tension. You just want these men to figure out that they are so close and inseparable there is only one logical place for them to go. There is just an unexpected something that they have to figure out to get there. It was a surprising shock to the dynamics of their relationship. Once Ian and Miro get on the same pageâ€¦ holy hell! This book gets hot quick. Miro and Ian have always just worked (not job wise specifically) well together. You know they are going to work well together in the bedroom and with a relationship. The flow of how it all works out is what I enjoyed the most.Iâ€™m shocked this is the first Mary Calmes book that I have read. I have some awesome reading to go catch up on. There are several characters here that have not only roles in some of her other books but books of their own. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing how she gave them their own happily ever after.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE323DZATDP3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LILB7F2#wasThisHelpful","RE323DZATDP3B","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can honestly say I walked away from Carry the Ocean feeling a little more enlightened to the struggles that some people have in their everyday life. Emmet has autism spectrum disorder. Jeremey has major depressive disorder along with clinical anxiety. Their story is told from their perspective. Iâ€™m typically not a fan of first person point of view. The way Heidi Cullinan did this book however made it work exceptionally well. I loved knowing exactly what Emmet and Jeremey were thinking, how they perceived things, and their reactions to it all from their point of view.Emmet to Jeremey â€œNo one is normal. Normal is a lie.â€Emmet and Jeremey both have some issues that make life difficult for them at times. Emmet has an amazing family that supports him in all things. Their unconditional love is the reason he is the strong young man that he is. Jeremeyâ€™s parents want only the best for their son. They just go about supporting him in ways that are hindering him and his problems. Once Emmet steps into Jeremeyâ€™s life Jeremey begins to see things a little differently. Emmet definitely sees Jeremeyâ€™s problems differently. Emmet sees the medical condition that makes Jeremeyâ€™s life so difficult.There is a very sweet love story here. There is also the deeper side to the story that will really open your eyes to other peopleâ€™s daily struggles. Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more of what Heidi has in store for her residents at The Roosevelt.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VMEIIOIEZZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW6FYLY#wasThisHelpful","R20VMEIIOIEZZU","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should have expected this, but I still found a small surprise in it. Eve has created the softer, less violent zombie apocalypse for her fans. The romance also take precedence over the zombies. So if youâ€™re worried about violence and gore, donâ€™t.It hasnâ€™t even been a couple of years since Brody left town on his Harley alone, breaking Hannahâ€™s heart. Hannahâ€™s heartache didnâ€™t stop there. The atrocities have continued to interrupt her life. The world dying away to zombies isnâ€™t even the worst of it. She has stayed on her family's homestead. She has managed scouting and foraging for supplies. Hannah has kept her disabled uncle and little sister from seeing the worst of what the world has come to. Theyâ€™re surviving, that has to be enough.Regrets. Brody has them. His biggest one is leaving Hannah behind. He has plans to make amends and the zombie apocalypse is not going to stop him. He has never stopped loving Hannah and he knows he will stop at nothing to get her back. He will allow nothing to get in his way of keeping her in his life. He just has to get back to their hometown. He hopes that she has survived for him to make up for the past.Apocalypse Cowboy is a fast paced read. The voilence is light and the romantic sexy is hot. This is a perfect zombie read for someone who canâ€™t handle the gore and violence that is heavy and horrific in many zombie apocalypse books. As with all Langlais books readers are given a well paired couple that keep the pages hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT31JVWA58P24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2CGFN6#wasThisHelpful","RT31JVWA58P24","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dark Kings series is one of the few paranormal romance series that I am still following along with. I recently changed favorite genres to mix it up a bit. The Dragon Kings and their world is different enough to still have me fully engaged in their world. The combination of Kings, Warriors, Druids, and Fae keep me impatiently waiting for the next book and what Donna Grant has in store for these characters that I have been following for a while now.Nightâ€™s Blaze brings readers Rhys and Lilyâ€™s story. They have both been present for a few books now and weâ€™ve known where they were going it was just getting them there. Getting them to their happily ever after was an adventurous ride. Rhys is still dealing with the injury of the horrid after effects of the Dark and Dragon magic wound he received. Lily is still trying to hide her past in the past.Things pick up there with Lilyâ€™s past barging into her life and making a total wreck of the semblance of life that she has created. The creep from her past is more than just a creep ex. He is evil incarnate and he has plans via his employer that involves Lily and Dreagan. Lily believing that there are only humans in the world has her going into this believing that there is no one to help her and she is alone in her fight.The attraction that Rhys has for Lily is nearly stalkerish in his need to watch her. The watching just feeds his desires to have her in his life. She has changed him in more ways than she could ever know. Itâ€™s a good thing that she has someone like Rhys watching her though. He sees that there is something going on. The something affects all those at Dreagan and Lily. These are the things that Rhys values most in his very long life. He does the only thing there is to do and that is protect what is his.Iâ€™m still loving this series. Donna introduces a couple of new characters. Many fans of the series like myself will get to have an â€˜I knew it!â€™ moment. The deeper I get into this series the more I want to know about Rhi, Balladyn, and Ulrik. I definitely want to know more about the two new players, one of which happens to be a recently awoken King who seems to have some past ties to another character that has had a major role in the series. So now I go back to impatiently waiting for the next book in this very sexy magical series.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C84BAP7WQLK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250060737#wasThisHelpful","R1C84BAP7WQLK8","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grabbed Jay Kirkpatrickâ€™s Freedom because the blurb was intriguing and I love a good male male romance. The reviews I read let me know I was purchasing a good read. Many people have tagged/shelved this as male male romance. This is not a romance. It is still a very good read. There is a bit of romance, several happily ever afters, many happy for nows, but not a romance.The world as we know it has been drastically changed by the Burst. It has left the majority of the land decimated. The inhabitants have also changed. Perhaps this change is simply evolution, it may also have been due to the Burst. People have been left with Talents. Some have very little in the way of their talents.Others are now strong telepaths, empaths, clairvoyants, telekinesis, and others are true unknowns. The few people remaining are diverse. Some choose to live Outside while others are dying to get picked to live in the City. Patrick considers himself lucky that as a Class One Empath he gets to live within the City.The first real solo case Patrick is given will open his eyes to so many things he never knew existed much less possible. The emaciated, battered and scarred John Doe 439 is going to rock Patrickâ€™s world and turn everything he knows upside down. Jac (JD439) is from the outside and his Talents are something beyond rare. He fears the white barren room he wakes in for good reason. Jac has experienced first-hand the horrors and atrocities that can be done to people by other humans. Jac knows that the place where his friendship begins with Patrick is not what it appears to be. He worries that Patrick is not what he appears to be.I enjoyed the story. While going in expecting a romance I was instead given a post-apocalyptic world where everything I know and love has changed. The world Patrick, Jac, and their friends, family, and coworkers are trying to not just live but to thrive in is riveting. When one decides to go against conformity and reach for freedom the way this world really works is given a different perspective and makes for an intense read. Definitely glad I read it. I know I would not have purchased it intentionally had I known upfront that I wasnâ€™t going to get a love story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AXBHXIL9OWE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623802830#wasThisHelpful","R1AXBHXIL9OWE3","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It all starts with a Jeep. The Jeep doesn't even belong to Jared but he is more than happy to show it the sexy stranger that walks into his business asking about it. That test drive is the beginning of an incredible friendship between Matt and Jared. Jared would love to be more than friends. He realizes that Matt is an amazing person though and he will take what he can get and if thatâ€™s just friends then he is happy with that. Matt claims that he is straight and see Jared as just that, a friend. One birthday celebration and some drunken kisses change perspectives and buried questions rise quickly to the surface.There are so many things that really worked for me with Promises. I love friends to lovers romances. Jared and Matt have a solid friendship even though it is a very new relationship. I loved Jaredâ€™s voice. There are so many times I felt like he was talking to me. He was just easy to get along with. His personality made the book a smooth read.Once Matt decides that he wants to be with Jared is where my enjoyment hit a bump. Up until this point Matt is dating a woman and Jared is happy as the out and open gay man. They have this role reversal that didnâ€™t feel right to me. Matt is ready to face the world with his lover Jared at his side. He doesnâ€™t care what anyone thinks. Jared on the other hand decides he would rather not go public with Matt. I never figured out if it was to save Matt harassment or to save himself heartache were Matt to change his mind of them being together. There is still a very sweet love story here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N9N8BK8I45UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TJAVPS#wasThisHelpful","R1N9N8BK8I45UV","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found a pleasant surprise within the pages of Light from the Dark, a romantic suspense. And truth be told this was a very suspenseful read. Christopher (Kitâ€™s) entire life has been rather suspenseful. Kitâ€™s life was horrifically altered when he was eight years old. He is the surviving witness to his parentâ€™s brutal murder. He was also kidnapped, harmed, and severely traumatized at that time. His child mind has coped with the events by blocking them all from memory. The tragedy never stopped though. As an adult he is still receiving threats, his home is not safe, and no matter how deep he retreats into his only sanctuary someone is always trying to get to him.Kitâ€™s uncle who doesnâ€™t take any of Kitâ€™s fears seriously hires Micah to babysit his feeble nephew. Micah is former Marine, former US Marshall, and desperate to get back to work after a protection detail went beyond wrong. The moment Micah walks into the Auberon estate and meets his new charge he immediately realizes he didnâ€™t get all of the facts on what is going on with Kitâ€™s life. Micah isnâ€™t even settled into his new role as sitter when the first threat to Kit presents itself. The job is infuriating to Micah because he knows he does not have all of the information he needs to best protect Kit, he doesnâ€™t even know what he is protecting Kit from.This book turned out to be an amazing romantic suspense. I never knew what was going to happen next. Kit is eccentric enough that itâ€™s difficult to see some of the obvious. Micah coming in as an outsider allows for readers to see Kit differently. Too many of the individuals that are close to Kit have painted him as the crazy spoiled brat who has locked himself away in the Auberon castle. Micah never saw much of that. He sees Kit as a beautiful young man who has been dealt a difficult hand in life. The feelings of attraction that spark allow for Micah to constantly be at Kitâ€™s side when things go from bad to worse and the threats escalate to full on bodily attacks.book provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K43ESDFE7HAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBV1LT2#wasThisHelpful","R2K43ESDFE7HAF","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Coil is one of those books that in the end Iâ€™m just not sure if it worked for me. The majority of the book did work for me. Mattie and Simon go into an opposites attract casual fling. There are things going on in both menâ€™s lives that prevent them from wanting something more. The more time they spend together the more each realizes that they are willing to give more to the other, but actually following through with giving more is where their difficulties lie.Thereâ€™s a reason I would never date a man with a child. I want to be the number one priority in my significant others life. Mattie goes into the casual romance with Simon knowing he will never be priority one in Simonâ€™s life. Simonâ€™s son Jamie holds that place, as he should. Mattie is wise beyond his years and much more intelligent (this made certain aspects of Mattie not work) than someone with his back ground should be and he understands his place and Jamieâ€™s place in Simonâ€™s life.The men not knowing how to up the ante on their developing feelings is what brings every struggle to their relationship. Everything that builds up from the initial meet and greet to the art institute acceptance letter made a strong foundation for a good relationship. Everything worked for me until the post card good bye. I still cannot wrap my mind around the idea much less why they thought it would work, although it did work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMRDSAOFGHAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009O8NW9K#wasThisHelpful","R1VMRDSAOFGHAK","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™m have to point out that Chaos Unchained is definitely more prison romance than motorcycle club romance. Readers first meet Chaos and enter this world while Chaos is still on Mars. He has been sentenced to six months on Earth (which is now a mining prison) for being caught with alcohol. This allows for the majority of the book to take place with Chaos and Beau in prison. The end portion of the last chapter takes place within the motorcycle club. In this dismal future alcohol among many other things are illegal with harsh punishments for offenders. Many of the things we have in everyday life are illegal in James Coxâ€™s Outlaw MC world.Itâ€™s not long after his arrival on Earth that Chaos is introduced to how his life will go for the next six months. There is an interesting hierarchy to this prison way of life. The few guards donâ€™t care what the inmates do. The inmates either mine, hook themselves out, or they fight. Chaos immediately knows which option is right for him, he fights. Itâ€™s after his first fight that he meets Beau.It doesnâ€™t take long for Beau to become the balm that soothes Chaos. They make the most of the short time they have together. Beau only has three month of his four year sentence left. This concerns Beau a bit. He knows that once he is back on Mars he doesnâ€™t have anywhere to go. He will be just another injustice homeless face. Mars and its laws and judicial system are full of flaws.I think the set up for correcting the wrongs of this world has been touched on in the pages of this very sexy novella. At this point the motorcycle club aspect of the series has been barely touched on. The other members are briefly introduced. Their thoughts on making Mars a better place to live have been mentioned as with the person who must be brought down. I believe that these are the places that readers will be taken with future books in this series.book provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWQS3ER5ZQTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TMW2TWY#wasThisHelpful","R2DWQS3ER5ZQTY","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are only a few authors that I can honestly say I get excited when they have a new release, Daisy Harris is one of them. Iâ€™ve never read anything by her that I didnâ€™t thoroughly enjoy. Keith and Max and their love story didnâ€™t disappoint. It was sweet, country, a bit sassy, and the right amount of opposites attract.Born and raised in Pookataw, Idaho a mostly rural and very country town Keith has choose to stay in the closet and not ever let anyone knowthat he favors the company of men. On occasion he goes into Boise for a random one night hook up. It may not be ideal but this is what has worked for Keith since he returned home after a couple years away at college to help his mother with her goat farm.Living out of boxes and traveling the country flipping real estate is what Max does. His job takes him everywhere for just a few months at a time. His current job has landed him in Podunk, Idaho and a ditch. His shiny Mercedes is not happy about the ditch but his rescuer in a rusty Ram may be exactly what he needs to help kill some time while he is getting this property developed and sold. The only problem is that Max soon realizes he doesnâ€™t want to leave this project, more importantly he doesnâ€™t want to leave the rancher who has his heart.Like I said this is a sweet country romance between two very different men. The road to happily ever after wasnâ€™t a smooth one. How could it be? One man is in the closet and the other never knew what the confine of that closet was like. One man knows where home is and the other one is just now discovering that home isnâ€™t an address but the arms of the sexy closeted rancher that he canâ€™t seem to get enough of.

"While reading Waiting for the Flood I kept waiting for something to happen. By the time I figured out what was going to happen or perhaps not going to happen (definitely a combination of the two) I was nearly at the end of this beautifully written, sweet little novella.Edwin is a bit of a complicated gent. I liked his little eccentrics though. He keeps to himself, stays in his own head. He has his reasons. The heartbreak from his ex while not fresh is still something that Edwin has clung to. Adam on the other hand was an unknown all together. The few days readers spend with these men is seen entirely from Edwinâ€™s point of view. Edwin was not exactly warm or welcoming to Adam the first few times they interacted. The reasons for the attraction were lost on me.There were just a few too many things I didnâ€™t understand. I was left feeling that I was not intelligent or clever enough to understand some of the things going on.

He needs the money to help him acquire the answers he is seeking. He doesnâ€™t expect the attraction and he certainly doesnâ€™t anticipate the reciprocation of all the thoughts and feelings that he is experiencing in the presence of his larger than life employer.The armor that Cree wears is to protect him from others. He doesnâ€™t need people in his life that will use him for his fame or money. He doesnâ€™t need lovers that are just looking to add a notch in their belt.

"â€œSeems like youâ€™re the exception to most of my rules.â€Rules. Tommy has a lot of rules. He has to. He is the adult keeping his family together. At twenty-two years young Tommy Oâ€™Shea is raising the seven younger Oâ€™Sheaâ€™s. The whole Oâ€™Shea pack is a rag tag mix of thieves, swindlers, and a set of twins that probably aren't even Oâ€™Sheaâ€™s, but they are Tommyâ€™s and he is doing the best with what little he has to see them raised. The raising is barely happening and his hopes and standards are low in comparison to most peoples but he will see that they get by. What he doesnâ€™t need is the cop that seems to be inserting himself into the Oâ€™Shea family.â€œIs it cool if I donâ€™t wanna take offâ€There are never any illusions as to what Bobby is getting himself into where Tommy is concerned. Bobby is a cop and knows first hand what the Oâ€™Shea parents are about. That doesnâ€™t keep him from wanting Tommy and the baggage that he comes with. Bobby is more than happy for the few hours of mostly interrupted time that he gets from Tommy. Bobby loves the kids and enjoys the time that he gets with Tommy and all of his siblings. Bobbyâ€™s biggest obstacle to a happily ever after with Tommy is Tommy.I love the fact that Cal and Cheryl (parents) are so accurately portrayed (in my honest opinion, I do have first hand experience in this) as true addicts. Their actions and behavior while horrid and ugly are spot one. Tommyâ€™s life sucks because of them. Tommy doesn'tâ€™ have a life because of his love and devotion to his younger siblings. Tommy has been burned most by the people who should care the most about him. He has an extremely difficult time letting outsiders into his world and itâ€™s an even more arduous task to trust others. Bobby is simply all over these boundaries.Everything about The Last Thing He Needs is so heartbreaking. Nothing goes right for Tommy for long. He spends his days waiting for the other shoe to drop. There are times where Bobby is the lone bright spot but you keep turning the pages waiting for that moment when he realizes the organized chaos that is Tommyâ€™s life is just too much. This is an amazing book and Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more for this new to me author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IEUBTI5WKETR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6Y2B5K#wasThisHelpful","R3IEUBTI5WKETR","A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me offer an executive summary of ""Turning Pro,"" before I give my detailed response. I consider ""Turning Pro"" to be a simple to read yet powerful self-help book. It contains a lot of practical wisdom that applies to almost every area of life. In particular, ""Turning Pro"" diagnoses the problem many of us have of being an amateur who settles for the lower things in life, out of fear and distraction. Pressfield then provides a remedy by defining what it means to Turn Pro and get serious about life and offers some wisdom on how to Turn Pro.What made ""Turning Pro"" most useful for me was that it provided the motivation for an extended self-examination. When you understand what Pressfield means by ""Turning Pro"" you'll be compelled to examine the beliefs, attitudes, and habits of your life to see if they're leading you where you want to go and be.Pressfield presents his wisdom in easy to read, small chunks. He whets your appetite for becoming a pro and clearly diagnoses the problem. However, even though the final section deals with how to become a pro, I left the book feeling as if there must be more. Maybe I'll need to go back and study the many brief points Pressfield makes: it may be all there, but somehow I felt like something is missing, so I'm giving the book 4 stars. Also, I feel like Pressfield beats a dead horse some times and begins repeating himself.The book needs a Table of Contents, especially since there are so many small sections. It didn't work on my Kindle version of the book.Now for the longer review.For a few years now, I've profited from the works of Stephen Pressfield (as well as Seth Godin, with whom he has now partnered). But this book has a particular appeal to me. Ever since I've been in 2nd grade, I wanted to be a writer. For years, starting high school, I wrote poetry and novels, but never had success in getting my works published. I'm sure, after reading this book that one of the reasons I didn't find ""success"" as a writer was because I wasn't sufficiently professional in my approach but instead always remained an amateur.Right off the bat, I appreciated the wisdom of ""Turning Pro"" because of what Pressfield presented as 3 Models of Transformation. His points that the therapeutic model of our problems (we're sick) and the moralistic model (we've sinned) are very similar to those made by Kent Dunnington in his excellent book ""Virtue and Addiction"" Dunnington's view is that the key to understanding addictions lies in the concept of habit: I highly recommend ""Addiction and Virtue""!Pressfield even devotes some time later to the ideas of both addiction and habits. In other words, there's a synergy of ideas that's taking place in our culture that's related to the idea of addiction and habits. At its heart, that's what ""Turning Pro"" is really about. Pressfield believes that the real problem is that we remain amateurs and never become professionals.Becoming a pro, basically, is about growing up. It's about becoming a man or woman in a world filled with adult children. One of the most important quotes from the book is this: ""The difference between an amateur and a professional is their habits."" Re-read and memorize this quote, and put Pressfield's wisdom into effect, and you'll see a changed life. Throughout much of my life, I haven't appreciated the power of habits as much as I should have. This is true for me as a Christian, father, and teacher. But the older I get, the more I realize how much of our lives are shaped by our habits.To be an amateur is to walk or run away from your true calling. This is the life of the addict or amateur: a life being distracted from your true calling. Once again, the application to my life, not just as a writer but also as father, teacher, and priest, is astounding! How much of the good life is about not being distracted from what's really important.Here is a second powerful quote from the book which I recommend reading and re-reading: ""The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a ""life,"" a ""character,"" a ""personality."" The artist and the professional, on the other hand, have turned a corner in their minds. They have succeeded in stepping back from themselves."" This sounds a lot like Christian love, but regardless of your religious or philosophical stance, it's true.Why do we choose distraction and addiction? Because it's easier in the short-term, and so much of what's wrong with our culture today is explained by what I call the bad trade of ""short term gain for long term pain."" Addicts and amateurs know that they're called to something great, but then they back away from the hard work and pain necessary to fulfill their calling. (Once again, spiritual analogies to this idea abound.) Addictions are the shadow form of our true calling and a metaphor for our best selves.Pressfield catalogues our addictions and discusses: addictions to failure, sex, distraction (the cures for this are concentration and depth), money, and trouble (the payoff for prison is incapacity and safety). He philosophizes more on the meaning of addiction, saying that ""The addict seeks to escape the pain of being human in one of two ways--by transcending it or by anesthetizing it."" I believe there's truth in this but also that Pressfield could go deeper on many such points.By the end of Book Two, I got the feeling that Pressfield was more or less repeating himself.In Book Two, Pressfield states that ""Fear is the primary color of the amateur's interior world. Fear of failure, fear of success, fear of looking foolish, fear of under-achieving and fear of over-achieving."" The professional is also fearful, but the difference between the two is how they handle this fear, something the book deals with in Book Three.There are parts of the book throughout where Pressfield belabors his point, but here's another useful observation he's made: ""The amateur allows his worth and identity to be defined by others. The amateur craves third-party validation. The amateur is tyrannized by his imagined conception of what is expected of him. He is imprisoned by what he believes he ought to think, how he ought to look, what he ought to do, and who he ought to be.""He also says that the Pro ""takes himself and the consequences of his actions so seriously that he paralyzes himself. The amateur fears, above all else, becoming (and being seen and judged as) himself."" I went through a long period of being an ""amateur,"" especially as a writer and teacher. But it wasn't because I was afraid of becoming myself: I just wasn't dedicated enough and didn't have enough good mentors.I would agree, however, with his comment that ""the amateur  seeks instant gratification.  In fact, I think this is one of the keys to understanding the amateur. Along with seeking instant gratification, the amateur and the addict ""focus exclusively on the product and the payoff. Their concern is what's in it for them, and how soon and how cheaply they can get it."" I see some of this in myself, and so in many ways ""Turning Pro"" has helped me conduct a useful self-examination.The next important quote sent chills down my spine because I know it's true for me: ""Because the amateur owns nothing of spirit in the present, she either looks forward to a hopeful future or backward to an idyllic past."" I have a tendency to keep looking to the future, and I'm quite nostalgic for the times in my life when things looked so much better.Another part I don't agree with is the idea that the Tribe doesn't care and that it's all up to us. One of the problems with a lot of us today is that we're too individualistic and don't realize our need for true community. In fact: I think a lot of postmodernism is being homeless and with no true community.How does Turning Pro change your life? You face your fears, your activities, and your habits. You structure your days to achieve an aim. And it changes how you spend our time and with whom you spend it.Pressfield closes Book Two by saying that Turning Pro involves a painful epiphany.In Book Three, Pressfield finally gets to the payoff: how to Turn Pro. He lists 20 characteristics of a pro:1. The professional shows up every day2. The professional stays on the job all day3. The professional is committed over the long haul4. For the professional, the stakes are high and real5. The professional is patient6. The professional seeks order7. The professional demystifies8. The professional acts in the face of fear9. The professional accepts no excuses10. The professional plays it as it lays11. The professional is prepared12. The professional does not show off13. The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique14. The professional does not hesitate to ask for help15. The professional does not take failure or success personally16. The professional does not identify with his or her instrument17. The professional endures adversity18. The professional self-validates19. The professional reinvents herself20. The professional is recognized by other professionalsHere are a few bonus characteristics:A pro is courageous; a pro doesn't get distracted; the pro is ruthless and yet compassionate with himself; lives in the present; delays instant gratification; does not wait for inspiration; and helps others.Listen to this next part carefully: it's one of the secrets of life. ""The physical leads to the spiritual. The humble produces the sublime. It seems counterintuitive, but it's true: in order to achieve ""flow,"" magic, ""the zone,"" we start by being common and ordinary and workmanlike."" I've found this to be true in life, over and over again.Finally, Pressfield gets to some of the ""how to"" that I was waiting for. The professional mindset is a practice. To ""have a practice"" in yoga, say, or tai chi, or calligraphy, is to follow a rigorous, prescribed regimen with the intention. This section reminds me of another favorite book of mine: ""Talent is Overrated."" Our habits, our practices, are what will make us pros.What follows is a mixed bag of attitudes the Pro needs to have. Some were more useful than others. Out of all of these, the most useful was this: ""I have a code of professionalism. I have virtues that I seek to strengthen and vices that I labor to eradicate.""Pressfield concludes by appealing to the Kabbalah, Platonic philosophy, and the worldview of the Masai to suggest that in life there is an upper and lower realm (guess which we're supposed to inhabit.By the end of the book I was very clear on what Pressfield was saying about Turning Pro. But I was left wanting more practical insight into how to do it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6Q707AAZ4HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087TUM54#wasThisHelpful","R3F6Q707AAZ4HO","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found Decker and Triplett's ""Bowing to Beijing"" to be a very informative book on the growing dangers that China poses to the U.S. Unfortunately, the book shows an unnecessary bias at times. However, in spite of this, Decker and Triplett are ultimately persuasive in portraying the dangers of China. In fact, they succeeded in making me revise my understanding of China in an important way, which I'll describe below. They are much less successful in portraying how President Obama has helps hasten Chinese domination.Decker and Triplett are at their best when they objectively chronicle the ways in which China is a threat to the U.S. On this most important issue, they are very persuasive as they catalog only a partial list of ways in which China threatens the U.S. One of the best sections of the book is the first one, which deals with the ""New China"" Myth. The ""New China"" Myth is that China is gradually emerging as a more modern and progressive society. According to this myth, if the U.S. keeps trading with China and making them rich, eventually we'll convince them of the virtues of a free capitalist society.This is the one major area where the book made me revise my beliefs about China. I remember teaching high school economics and government years ago, and I taught that China was on a collision course with itself. The new freedom of Chinese capitalism couldn't co-exist forever with the old Chinese oppressive Communism. I cautiously predicted that the taste of capitalism would eventually cause the Chinese to gradually become capitalistic - either that or ruthlessly regress to a more purely Communist state. But after reading ""Bowing to Beijing,"" I now believe that China can continue to do what it's currently doing: allow a crony capitalism which benefits a lot of people to some degree but mostly aggrandizes the power of a relatively few elite families.The facts are that China still does not have a great deal of religious freedom or freedom of the press. Property rights exist primarily to enrich the elites, and the right to life is not valued much in Communist China. The key to understanding why capitalism as we know it in the U.S. will not be likely to transform China for the better is that the economy is tightly controlled by a hereditary oligarchy called ""the Princelings."" This group of 200-300 descendants of the original Communist Party members are the primary beneficiaries of economic wealth and political power.Other useful information in ""Bowing to Beijing"" includes a discussion of the growing Chinese militarization. This includes not only a growing military expenditure but also a smuggling axis of arms of which China is a part. Just as unsettling is the way in which China is virtually declaring war on the U.S. through stealing and spying. In the last 3 years more than 60 Americans have been prosecuted for spying for China. Also, China has been attacking computer systems in the U.S., as well as stealing a lot of American technology.The chapter on how the U.S. has become economically dependent on China is well known material, but I'm still glad they included it. A final chapter on how many American political leaders are unduly influenced by Chinese money and power was newer material to me and among some of the most disturbing in the entire book.There are 2 things that keep the book from being a 5-star book. I would like to give it three and a half stars, but I'll round it up to four. First, there are some places where the authors unnecessarily seem biased against President Obama. I don't mind if they sharply criticize him, but some of the attitude towards him seems gratuitous in a book of this nature. More substantially, I find part of the major premise of the book - that Obama is hastening America's demise and Chinese domination - to be relatively lacking in substance. If the book were portrayed a book speaking generally of China's growing threat it would have been more satisfying. As it is, there are a few pages here and there where details are given about how Obama or his administration are either ignoring the Chinese threat or purposely obscuring it. But there is not nearly enough of this information, given that one of the premises of the book is precisely that Obama is actively facilitating the Chinese threat. If that's the claim of the book, then more evidence should be concluded.In summary, the book is a good overview of the Chinese threat but fails to establish Obama's role in this as much as it should have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L19NVC9DZGFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596982896#wasThisHelpful","R2L19NVC9DZGFI","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Albert Moehler is a Christian phenomenon. His presence for the good of God's Kingdom seems to be everywhere, and finally he's written a book. While I agree with almost all that Moehler has to say in ""Culture Shift"" I still don't think it's a great book. This is primarily because the book is divided up into 25 episodic chapters that have no overall theme except the vague one of ""Culture Shift."" Since each chapter is only 6-7 pages or so, this doesn't leave a lot of room for Moehler to go into much detail.I do enjoy the range of the topics Moehler covers, which is some (but not enough compensation) for the sort of shotgun approach of the book. The first chapter, Engaging the City of Man is good as far as it goes but is far too general to be of real help. Other examples of weak chapters are Chapter 19 on Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream and Chapter 20 on Islam (which needed to be dealt with at much greater length). Chapters that I found somewhat helpful include Chapters 2-4, where Moehler sustains an argument about Christian morality and law, and Chapter 14 on Who's Afraid of the Fetus (on the importance of using the ultrasound to educate and change minds.)Overall, the book is sound in which Moehler teaches, but it's just not deep enough. Think of it as a sort of Christian primer on a number of cultural issues and the book has some, but limited, value.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7W0IBL2FF58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601423810#wasThisHelpful","R3U7W0IBL2FF58","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In examining various lists of the greatest religious films ever made, ""Beckett"" is one film that inevitably appears - and with good reason. While it would be easy to think of ""Beckett"" as being a great film because it was nominated for 12 Oscars, I measure its greatness in terms of its acting, the writing, its historical element, and its themes of true religion and friendship.First, the acting. Both Richard Burton (Beckett) and Peter O'Toole (King Henry II) received Oscar nominations for their roles, and both deserved it. Having either of these great actors in his prime would be a treat, but having both together is something special. While I detest the selfish and self-destructive Henry II that O'Toole portrays, O'Toole makes Henry an intriguing, comical, and tragic figure for the viewer. Burton's Beckett, on the other hand, ends up being someone who is not just crafty as at the beginning of the movie but also courageous and substantial in the end.The writing is also excellent. The movie actually won the Oscar for Best Screenplay, and it's not surprising. ""Becket"" is based on the play by French playwright Jean Anouilh and was adapted for the screen by Edward Anhalt. ""Beckett"" was actually Anhalt's second Oscar for Best Screenplay. The film manages to hold the viewer's interest, despite the length of the film (148 minutes): my two teenaged children were engaged throughout. Anouilh and Anhalt manage to make Henry and Beckett walk out of the history pages and become living characters. ""Beckett"" is also filled with a lot of memorable dialogue. Not the noblest words ever spoken by a husband, but certainly some of the most memorable are those spoken by Henry to his wife: ""Your body, madam, was a desert that duty forced me to wander in alone. But you have never been a wife to me!"" While my son's favorite quote was Henry's ""I haven't bathed for a long time and I stink,"" the most famous is `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?""Which brings me to the historical element. While ""Beckett,"" naturally takes liberties with history, the essence of the story is true. My wife and oldest daughter both like historical fiction, and ""Beckett"" is fine historical fiction. The movie gives you a sense not only of the conflict between Saxons and Normans in 12th century England but also of the centuries-long struggle between church and state in Europe.But what makes the historical element especially rich is the film's religious dimension. ""Beckett"" is not only a historical film but also a religious one. I don't mean that it merely deals ""with"" religion but that it also illuminates some of the features of true Christianity. Dramatically, it's good writing to have Beckett undergo a transformation from sinner to saint when he's consecrated archbishop. Historically, it's a fact. But religiously, it's true. ""Beckett"" is a powerful portrayal of the grace of God in a man's life, yet it accomplishes this without ever becoming ""preachy."" The same grace that Beckett received and which made him able to forsake all for the sake of God and His honor is the grace which Henry steadfastly refuses to accept. Beckett's religious courage is an inspiring example to me and my children.Finally, Beckett is about friendship. While Beckett and Henry's friendship begins with drinking and whoring, it's a much deeper friendship than that. In fact, it appears that Beckett is the only friend Henry ever had. The fact that Beckett ultimately chose God over Henry is not only a threat to his kingship but, perhaps more importantly to the cinematic Henry, a threat to his friendship. For while Henry hates Beckett, he also loves him.""Beckett"" is a masterpiece on many levels. I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EI3KR0C2XTBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007G1WH#wasThisHelpful","R1EI3KR0C2XTBK","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many Christians have recognized that the Church today seems to have a problem with men not coming to church. As a priest concerned about this trend, I decided to read David Murrow's ""Why Men Hate Going to Church."" While I found a lot of useful information in the book, I was disappointed in many places by Murrow's lack of discernment in evaluating some of the information he presents. Also, he seems to have taken a shotgun approach and has included almost any information related to the lack of men in church, without regard for a deeper discussion of the issues. In addition, some of his prescriptions are not, I believe, good ones.As with much of the book, Chapter 2 contains some good statistics demonstrating the lack of men in church. But Murrow gives this away when he mentions elsewhere that this has been true historically and is true today for the Church throughout the world, and not just America. In other words, Murrow's thesis proves too much. If Christianity has always had more women than men in their churches, then not only is this not a new or specifically American phenomenon: it also may not be that bad of a thing. Such nuances never enter into Murrow's discussion.In Chapter 3, Murrow lists some characteristics of men that may benefit the Church. While this list is somewhat useful, it also demonstrates a persistent, negative side of the book: Murrow portrays men in terms of particular stereotypes and seems to expect that all men will fit these stereotypes. Perhaps the most obnoxious of these is when Murrow claims that ""highly masculine men are missing."" Masculine defined how? Murrow slants his definition of masculine away from any men who are verbal, studious, and sensitive. To me, these characteristics seem to be the kind that will make a good pastor.In Chapter 7, there's certainly some truth to Murrow's assertion that preaching, theology, and worship have gone ""soft"" and that there has been an explosion of female-oriented ministries. But as is usual, Murrow mostly asserts and doesn't prove his conclusions. Murrow also has a tendency to speak in such large generalizations that his book is less useful. For example, on page 9 Murrow writes that ""Men don't hate God or Christ or the Bible or Christianity."" Really? Many, many do.He's also right in that so much of contemporary praise music are market driven and is about God being intimately at my side and even contain imagery that is overtly romantic and feminine. Chapter 12 is also useful when Murrow talks about the Church's use of feminine language and dÃ©cor, hand-holding and emotion. These kinds of chapters help the reader form a larger picture of some of the many reasons churches may not attract men.Chapter 10 on Twelve Things Men Fear About Church seems like a made up list of reasons not to go to church, and have very little to do with men specifically. It's another place where I find Murrow's analysis to be shallow.Finally, some of Murrow's prescriptions are market driven - one of the things he correctly criticizes. In Chapter 18 he says that sermons should use visuals, be short, use humor and laughter, and do something unexpected. Murrow seems to advocate dumbing down worship for men. Similarly, his prescriptions for how to make Sunday school relevant are destined to make it meaningless. Rather than returning to a richer biblical or catechetical approach, Murrow would have us hold Sunday school in a large, open room and use a style that gives boys ""an equal chance to win."" His church has renamed Sunday school ""Adventureland."" As children arrive, they're allowed to run around in a large room with lots of things to play with. One room even has a climbing wall. There's a competition and a video, a brief lesson, and then more free play. This sounds more like daycare than a time to instruct children in the things of God! Likewise, he advocates churches building cool spaces for youth to gather so they can play foosball and air hockey.In summary, there are some good ideas in this book, but also some bogus ones, and not a lot of depth behind the ideas as presented.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze book review bloggers program.

"Marriage is clearly a troubled institution in American culture, and that includes even among American Christians. The problem is that so often Christians have accepted the world's definitions of marriage. While many Christian books have been written on marriage, Tim Keller's ""The Meaning of Marriage"" is one of the best.What makes ""The Meaning of Marriage"" so excellent? At least four things. First, Keller gives a vision for marriage. His main reason for writing the book, in fact, was to give both Christians and non-Christians a vision for marriage. What is Keller's vision for marriage? Keller writes, concerning the meaning of marriage, that ""It is for helping each other to become our future glory-selves, the new creations that God will eventually make us."" More than this, Keller (in Chapter 6) relates marriage not only to ""the dance of the Trinity"" but also to Christ's love of the stranger (Chapter 5).The second reason ""The Meaning of Marriage"" is so excellent is that Keller bases his views on the Bible. Time and again, instead of turning to what the world teaches about marriage, Keller returns to the Bible, especially Ephesians 5. While Keller begins with the Bible, he does more than just quote Scripture: he unlocks its meaning and applies it to our lives. This is what makes his teaching on writing so profound and powerful. While he doesn't cover every possible topic, he does give a theological vision for marriage that will change your marriage for the better or better prepare you for marriage in the future.Third, in presenting a biblical view of marriage, Keller directly challenges the worldly views of marriage, including many that have infected the Church. Among the most popular of these myths is that we should be looking for our ""soul mate,"" in the sense of finding someone we're presently in love with. This view minimizes the importance of the hard work that goes into marital love. Keller also rightly rebukes the idea that we should not go into marriage expecting to change the other person. To the contrary, marriage is precisely for the purpose of sanctifying one another, and Keller demonstrates some of the many reasons why marriage is such a powerful means of sanctification for Christian spouses. Keller takes on many other myths as well, for example, the idea that marriage is primarily for self-fulfillment, instead of mutual sanctification and becoming one with another.Fourth, ""The Meaning of Marriage"" is both readable and practical. Keller's ideas are rooted in theology but are written in a very readable prose. Most importantly, his book is eminently practical. While it's not a ""How To"" manual and doesn't give you every detail, he does amply illustrate and explain his major ideas on marriage. So practical is ""The Meaning of Marriage"" that it's applicable not only to Christian spouses but also non-Christian spouses and Christian singles.  He has, for example, a chapter on a theology of singleness (Chapter 7).There are many profound insights in the book. There was little that was new to me as a priest and as a husband who has worked every day on his marriage for 18 years. But there were still many revelations and ""Aha!"" moments that reminded me of what it was all about and encouraged me to love my wife to an even greater degree. As I'm writing this, she's out of town on a business trip (which she never takes). I can't wait for her to return so that I can begin immediately putting into practice some of the things Keller has taught me.Here are some of his best insights:1. You never marry the right person. No 2 people are compatible. For this reason, marriage takes a lot of love and work. Also, marriage profoundly changes us!2. Two-thirds of unhappy marriages will become happy within five years if people stay married. Keller uses this to demonstrate the power of making and keeping a vow. Promising is the key to identity and is the very essence of marital love.3. Actions of love lead to feelings of love.4. Marriage is a friendship, and friendship must have constancy, transparency, and a common passion, which, for Christians, should especially be Christ.5. Each spouse should see the great thing that Jesus is doing in the life of their mate through the Word. And each spouse should then give himself of herself to be a vehicle for this work of God.6. Your spouse IS the ""someone better"" you're looking for! This is true if you see him or her in terms of the glory God intends for them, a work to which you are called.There's much, much, more, and each chapter holds its delights and wisdom for the reader. I highly recommend both ""The Meaning of Marriage,"" as well as ""The Mystery of Marriage"" by Mike Mason!Keller presents his teaching on marriage, based on a sermon series of his, in the following chapters:1. The Secret of Marriage - how marriage and the gospel relate2. The Power for Marriage - submitting to one another out of love3. The Essence of Marriage - covenantal commitment4. The Mission of Marriage - marriage and mutual sanctification5. Loving the Stranger - the power of love (all 4 kinds)6. Embracing the Other - man and wife as one flesh; the Trinity as a model for marriage7. Singleness and Marriage8.

"I'm a huge fan of N.T. Wright. He's a fellow Anglican, but more importantly I've enjoyed numerous works of his, especially his nuanced insights into St. Paul's language and theology. He's not only a first-rate theologian but also an excellent popularizer. For these reasons I had the highest hopes for his new translation of the New Testament: ""The Kingdom New Testament.""While there's a lot to appreciate in Wright's effort, there are also a number of negative elements, the most negative of which is his insistence on inclusive language that distorts the meaning of various texts.Wright's translation was written as part of his ""Bible for Everyone"" series. I've read and reviewed several of these popular commentaries on the New Testament, and they're excellent. Wright helpfully lays out his philosophy of translation in his Preface. He draws attention to the fact that his work is a translation and not a paraphrase, like, for example, Peterson's ""The Message."" I greatly appreciate this fact. He's opted for conveying an informality and sense of excitement and energy over a more formal or stately prose, an approach which ends up having both pros and cons, although in theory I like the attempt.On many levels, I applaud Wright's attempt to make the New Testament fresh again by using less formal language. For example, in Matthew 1, Wright chooses to use ""family tree"" instead of ""genealogy,"" which I think is a nice replacement word: it makes the language more familiar and easier to understand, without sacrificing meaning. There are numerous other examples of such happy word choices. As a whole, Wright's text reads very nicely and accomplishes its purpose of making the text less formal and more energetic. I also like the fact that at times Wright replaces the title ""Christ"" with either ""Messiah"" or ""King."" Even though it may sound unorthodox, I appreciate Wright's instinct to get away from the old language of ""Christ"" which for many seems more like a last name than a title.Sometimes, however, Wright's language is jarring or seems inappropriate. For example, in Matthew 4:9 when Satan is tempting Jesus, he says, ""I'll give the whole lot to you"" (speaking of the kingdoms of the world.) Another example of an attempt to modernize that is not especially helpful occurs in Matthew 6:7 when Jesus proclaims ""When you pray, don't pile up a jumbled heap of words!"" An even less helpful translation occurs in Matthew 7:5 when Wright chooses to replace the word ""hypocrite"" with ""play-acting."" This substantially weakens the language, without any positive gain in the choice of words. There are many other cases of such unfortunate substitutions, even as there are many beneficial ones as well.An example of where Wright's language is both helpful and less than helpful occurs in John 21, where Jesus and Peter have an encounter in which Jesus restores Peter. The less formal language is a good thing here: ""I'm going fishing"" instead of the more stilted ""I am going fishing"" and ""We'll go"" instead of ""We will go"" are good changes. However, for some unknown reason Wright has seen fit to take it upon himself to change Peter's words to Jesus from ""You know that I love you"" to ""you know that I'm your friend."" This produces no positive effect, while it lessens the force of what Peter is saying and has the downside of changing what God clearly intended (through St. John) to communicate.While Wright's insights into Paul's words and theology have had a powerful influence on contemporary theology (I believe for the better) his great learning sometimes leads to confusing choices. This is especially true for his replacements for the word ""righteousness"" which occur throughout his translation of Romans. In Romans 1:18, Wright replaces ""unrighteousness"" with ""injustice."" This not only narrows Paul's intention here but also unnecessarily slants it toward one particular aspect of unrighteousness. It also makes less sense in the context of the larger passage. While Wright is aware as a scholar of the shades of meaning of the word ""righteousness"" it's just plain confusing to interpret the same Greek word 3 different ways in one passage. In Romans 4:3 ""righteousness"" becomes ""putting him in the right;"" in Romans 4:11 it's rendered ""status of covenant membership;"" and in Romans 4:13 it's translated ""covenant justice."" This creates more confusion than clarity, something Wright was clearly aiming at with this contemporary translation.Wright's most unfortunate changes involve his mission to render the New Testament in inclusive language. As a proponent of women's ordination, he clearly has an ax to grind here, and it sometimes leads to unfaithful translations of the Bible. Not only has he changed the language to be less faithful to the original but when he's done so he makes it more difficult for the readers of his text to know what the original text actually says. There are many examples of this, some worse than others. The most numerous and least offensive examples are where Wright substitutes, for example, the word ""brothers"" with ""brothers and sisters"" or ""family."" A more substantial example is in Romans 5:15 and following when Wright substitutes ""one man's trespasses"" with ""one person's trespasses."" But the fact that Adam as a male was the covenant head of mankind is now obscured by Wright, and this covenant headship of both Adam and Christ is essential to St. Paul's thought. Worst of all, however, is 1 Timothy 2:11-15. While verse 11 should read ""Let a woman learn quietly with submissiveness,"" Wright translates it as ""They must study undisturbed, in full submission to God."" ""Study undisturbed"" sounds like a woman studying on her own without distraction. But from the rest of the passage it's clear that Paul is talking about women in general when they are being taught by men. Wright's worst translation in the entire translation, as far as I could tell, is 1 Timothy 2:12. This verse should read ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet."" Wright doesn't even attempt to paraphrase here but radically alters the meaning. This is not a translation at this point but a deliberate attempt to re-write what St. Paul clearly wrote. Wright's version is: I'm not saying that women should teach men, or try to dictate to them; rather they should be left undisturbed."" Whether you're in favor of women's ordination or not, we should all agree to let the text speak for itself.It's a shame that Wright made some of the translation choices he made. ""The Kingdom New Testament"" has so much to commend it, with the theological background of Wright, the often pleasing and informal language, and some fresh word choices. Unfortunately, I believe the translation's flaws will prevent it from becoming, as Wright hoped, one of the 2 or 3 translations that modern Christians would most rely on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GGOJ06RDQQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062064916#wasThisHelpful","R23GGOJ06RDQQ7","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of Rodney Stark because his works are both scholarly and readable, as well as being well-argued, well-researched, and positively revelatory. His new book, ""The Triumph of Christianity,"" is similar to his earlier work, ""The Rise of Christianity."" However he not only extends the time of his discussion to cover all of church history but has also incorporated what he calls ""new perspectives"" on some old questions.I highly recommend ""The Triumph of Christianity"" for the following reasons. First, Stark presents a lot of intriguing and important information that is hard to find anywhere else. Second, his work is very well-researched and based on this solid research he provides provocative insights into Christianity that are bound to deepen one's understanding. Third, Stark packs an amazing amount of information into one book. Fourth, while being academically sound his writing is also very readable.Stark's startling insights often overturn a lot of mischievous nonsense about Christianity and common misperceptions. He does it with amazing clarity and authority, and what he says matches up with all I've observed about human behavior and what I've read about sociology. The book would be well worth its price for only a fraction of the revelations Stark communicates. I just finished the Kindle version but am thinking about also ordering a hard copy so I can properly mark it up as I like to do with an important work.In Part 1, Stark presents a succinct and useful summary of other religions at time of Christ, as well as why Oriental religions (besides Judaism) appealed to the Roman world and paved the way for Christianity. These reasons include emotion, joy, music, the importance of congregations, a religious identity that competed with and could be more important than political or familial identity, and the fact that it offered more opportunities for women. Much of this is information you don't usually see in books on early Christian background, which usually focus on Roman politics or Jewish religion.Chapter 2 shows the diversity of 1st century Judaism and also contains a wealth of information. I especially like the way Stark applies his model of the religious economy from previous works to the Jewish religious situation of the 1st century.In Part 2, Chapter 3, I like the way that Stark emphasizes that Christ was a rabbi or teacher (stated many times in the Gospels) over the idea that he was a carpenter (mentioned once in a passage that may actually mean something else). ""The Triumph of Christianity"" is stuffed with such intriguing and helpful new ways of seeing Christianity. In this chapter, Stark also rehearses an incredibly important theme from some of his other works: the idea that ""people tend to convert to a religious group when their social ties to members outweigh their ties to outsiders who might oppose the conversion.""While Stark had already convinced me in some of his earlier works, it will be astonishing news to some that Christianity appealed especially in the beginning to those of privilege (see Chapter 5). Chapter 6 is also a chapter of revelation as Stark argues persuasively that Christianity created a better (including longer and healthier) life for people, even here on earth. The idea that Christianity exalted women (and also marriage and children) more than other religions or philosophies of the ancient world (Chapter 7) may be old news to some, but it's a crucial idea that needs to be repeated. Stark's Chapter 9 on assessing Christian growth is also a re-statement of his earlier works, but it's a fascinating explanation of how and why Christianity grew so rapidly in the early centuries.In Part 3 Stark switches gears somewhat as Christianity became established. Stark finds both good and bad in Constantine, which is generally a fair assessment. He explains that while Constantine's conversion ended persecution it also encouraged intolerance toward dissent within the church and greatly reduced the piety and dedication of the clergy. I have a slight disagreement with Stark here: a more positive and more detailed assessment of Constantine is given by Peter Leithart in ""Defending Constantine."" Stark presents an interesting and informative flow of Christian history as he describes the triumph of Christianity over paganism, which was not the result of Christian persecution but which was also not as complete as usually assumed. He continues with a discussion of Christianity's engagement and retreat from Islam and then re-orients the Crusades in a more positive light, as he does at greater length in ""God's Battalions.""In Part 4 Stark rebukes the received wisdom that the rise of Christianity ushered in many centuries of ignorance subsequent to the fall of Rome. In fact, the so-called ""Dark Ages"" never existed. Lest the reader think Stark is simply slanting everything to make Christianity look nearly perfect, he's also quick to point out that medieval Christians weren't nearly as pious as we imagine they were. Perhaps most importantly, Stark correctly establishes the fact that far from impeding the rise of science, the West was the birthplace of science because of Christianity.In Part 5 Stark argues that the new religious movements that arose in Europe prior to the fifteenth century are identified as heresies because they failed, while Luther's ""heresy"" is called the Reformation because it survived. While this is one area where I have to disagree with Stark, he does provide some good information for why the Reformation succeeded. Perhaps the most startling revelation in the book to me is that new research indicates that the Spanish Inquisition was much more a force of moderation than of torture and death than we've been told. I'll have to go and verify that one, but leave it to Stark to reveal it!Finally, in Part 6 Stark revisits his research on how religions fare when there is religious pluralism, such as established in the United States. Stark's model explains, for example, why the fact that churches have to compete in a religious marketplace is actually a good thing for religion. If you want to read the definitive work on this, then read Stark and Finke's ""Acts of Faith."" Stark also contends with now disproved theories of secularization that naively assumed religion was on the demise. This, too, is an important truth that will be a startling reversal of the common myths we usually hear. Chapter 22 makes a fitting conclusion to Stark's meaty work because it chronicles the globalization of Christianity and explains some of the reasons why Christianity continues to grow, not the least of which is its cultural flexibility.I strongly recommend ""The Triumph of Christianity"" to any serious student of Christianity, from educated laymen to Christian leaders to students and teachers. It explains a great deal about Christianity, all in one place, that you won't hear many other places.The book is organized according to the following plan:PART I - Christmas EveChapter One - The Religious ContextChapter Two - Many JudaismsPART II - Christianizing the EmpireChapter Three - Jesus and the Jesus MovementChapter Four - Missions to the Jews and the GentilesChapter Five - Christianity and PrivilegeChapter Six - Misery and MercyChapter Seven - Appeals to WomenChapter Eight - Persecution and CommitmentChapter Nine - Assessing Christian GrowthPART III - Consolidating Christian EuropeChapter Ten - Constantine's Very Mixed BlessingsChapter Eleven - The Demise of PaganismChapter Twelve - Islam and the Destruction of Eastern and North African ChristianityChapter Thirteen - Europe RespondsPART IV - Medieval Currents Chapter Fourteen - The ""Dark Ages"" and Other Mythical ErasChapter Fifteen - The People's ReligionChapter Sixteen - Faith and the Scientific ""Revolution""PART V - Christianity DividedChapter Seventeen - Two ""Churches"" and the Challenge of HeresyChapter Eighteen - Luther's ReformationChapter Nineteen - The Shocking Truth About the Spanish InquisitionPART VI - New Worlds and Christian GrowthChapter Twenty - Pluralism and American PietyChapter Twenty-One - SecularizationChapter Twenty-Two - Globalization","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT1T78CTF6MX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062007688#wasThisHelpful","RT1T78CTF6MX6","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"N.T. Wright's latest book, ""Simply Jesus,"" claims to be a new vision of who Jesus is and what He did. Ultimately, the book is what it claims. It's a sometimes brilliant and inspiring re-presentation of who Jesus is and what He came to do. But unfortunately, Wright doesn't make this clear until the end of Chapter 11. A good summary of Wright's major theme is this sentence from Chapter 11: ""The gospels are not about `how Jesus turned out to be God.' They are about how God became king on earth as in heaven."" Put another way: the Good News of Jesus Christ has to do with much more than people simply escaping earth for heaven.Wright develops this theme throughout and does, indeed, offer a fresh and invigorating vision of Jesus Christ. But the book is marred by the fact that Wright's best and most important ideas aren't clear until so late in the book that they would be easy to miss. In fact, I would highly recommend reading Chapters 11, 13, 14, and 15 first so that the rest of the book may be more profitable! Because of the wonderful, challenging insights in the final few chapters, I give the book 4 stars, despite a very slow and not particularly refreshing beginning.Chapter 1 is very slow going and doesn't do much to present Jesus in a new light or help us to see Him any better. In Chapter 2, Wright presents 3 puzzles understanding Jesus represents: Jesus' world is foreign to us; Jesus' God is strange to us; and Jesus spoke and acted as if he was in charge. Chapter 2 wasn't particularly insightful.Chapter 3 discusses what Wright terms the distortions of skepticism and conservatism. He's wrong, however, to put the two on the same level; one proceeds from faith and is an honest attempt to accept the Christ of the Gospels - the other isn't. He presents the ""conservative"" view in such a way that it's hard to find much fault with it, except that it does leave some important things out and has some misunderstandings. But this doesn't, at least from the discussion in Chapter 3, merit the approbation Wright uses. Why, for example, is he so upset with the fact that both skepticism and conservatism ask the question: ""Did it happen?"" Wright himself has already spoken of how Christianity is a historical religion. He clearly has an axe to grind against ""conservative"" Christians, who believe things very close to what Wright believes. This unfortunately mars this work by Wright. Why would he, for example, call it ""would be `Christian"" conservatism"" when discussing a view that takes the Bible seriously and Jesus as the historical God made flesh? Chapter 3 also deals with historical complexity; unfortunately, Wright raises the issue here but doesn't shed much light on how to understand Jesus better until later in the book. I came to the book for a better picture of Jesus, not 3 chapters stating how our current views are inadequate.Finally, in Chapter 4, Wright gets down to giving us some useful historical background to better understand the meaning of Jesus. He discusses, for example, the religious significance of Augustus Caesar and Jesus' threat to the traditional religion of Rome. I do like the way that Wright contrasts the Roman ""retrospective"" eschatology that looked to the past to the Jewish ""prospective"" eschatology that looked to the future. It's useful, as well, to see the 1st century Jewish situation as being set against an evil empire and a coming deliverer.Chapter 5 is a chapter on God as King. There's nothing remarkable, but it does set the tone for the rest of the book which develops the major theme of the Gospels that God has now come as King. Chapter 6 explores the key theme that God's in charge now and is King. The chapter contains a useful, brief outline of Jewish history and a good treatment of the Exodus and 7 themes of the Exodus. Chapter 7 is generally useful as Wright presents God's rule as manifested by forgiveness and healing. But, again, nothing particularly new or exciting.Chapter 8 is a little more interesting as Wright discusses the importance of the stories that Jesus told.  ""They were stories designed to tease, to clothe the shocking and revolutionary message of God's kingdom in garb that left the hearers wondering, trying to think it out, never quite able (until near the end) to pin Jesus down."" It's useful to think of the parables as Wright does, that ""They are saying: `Don't be surprised, but this is what it looks like when God's in charge.'""Chapter 9 contrasts Christ as King with 2 failed Jewish kings - one before and one after Christ. It's useful as history and to make a point about Jewish expectations, but it didn't discuss Christ as King very much and therefore was not as helpful as it might have been. Chapter 10 is about battle the King will fight and how it's not so easy to see who's on which side of the battle.By this point in the book I had resigned myself to having bought a book that wasn't particularly worthwhile. It would have been tempting to give up and go on to something else. Am I glad I kept reading!Chapter 11, on Space, Time, and Matter, struck me as particularly illuminating and represents the kind of fresh look I'd hoped to see all throughout the book. Here, Wright portrays the Temple as the nexus of Heaven and Earth. He continues by exploring the themes of how where God dwells was redefined by Jesus, how Time was fulfilled by Him, and how God has instituted a New Creation. These are especially rich and fruitful themes that should help many Christians see what the true meaning of Christ is in a new and deeper way.Perhaps the most important paragraph of the whole book is tucked away at the end of Chapter 11: ""First, it will not do to suppose that Jesus came to teach people `how to get to heaven.' That view has been immensely popular in Western Christianity for many generations, but it simply won't do. The whole point of Jesus's public career was not to tell people that God was in heaven and that, at death, they could leave ""earth"" behind and go to be with him there. It was to tell them that God was now taking charge, right here on `earth.'"" This thought lies behind Wright's earlier objections to ""conservatism."" It won't do to think of the Gospels as being traditional proofs of God, Wright says, but instead we should see them as ones that would have made sense to 1st century Jews. We should see Jesus ""as the reality to which Temple, sabbath, and creation itself were pointing. That is, or ought to be, a clear indication that, in terms of the `God' of first-century Jews, Jesus understood himself to be embodying this God, doing things whose best explanation was that this was what God was doing, and so on.""In other words (and this is the very essence of what Wright is teaching): ""The gospels are not about `how Jesus turned out to be God.' They are about how God became king on earth as in heaven."" This is so important that I think Wright made a serious strategic mistake by not leading with these thoughts at the beginning. They are easily lost in much more mundane material.Once again, I found Chapter 12 not all too illuminating. But Wright recovers his provocative and enlightening form in Chapter 13, where he frames Christ in terms of his uniting of the offices of prophet, priest, and king and his fulfillment of the Exodus story. Again, I wish there had been more of the material like Chapter 13. It's in such writing that he's at his best weaving together the complex imagery and narratives that culminate in Jesus Christ.While Wright doesn't dismiss other ways of viewing the meaning of Jesus' death, such as an example of love, a representation of His people, and a penal understanding, Wright transcends these limited understandings. Ultimately, Wright thinks these other meanings are all united in the greater meaning that ""Jesus's death was seen by Jesus himself, and then by those who told and ultimately wrote his story, as the ultimate means by which God's kingdom is established.""I love the way that Wright, in Chapter 14, speaks of Easter as being the New Creation that demonstrates that ""God's kingdom is now launched, and launched in power and glory, on earth as in heaven."" He ties the Resurrection, as well, to Ascension and Enthronement, two aspects that are often tragically left out of traditional conservative theology.Wright concludes in Chapter 15 with where I wish he had begun: by a brilliant presentation of how Jesus is already the Ruler of the World.In the end, ""Simply Jesus"" lives up to its large claim to be a new look at Jesus and what He did. I heartily recommend it with the very important qualification that the best material is all in the last 5 chapters. You may want to read them first!Wright presents his ideas in the following chapters:Part OneChapter 1 - A Very Odd Sort of KingChapter 2 - The Three PuzzlesChapter 3 - The Perfect StormChapter 4 - The Making of a First-Century StormChapter 5 - The HurricanePart TwoChapter 6 - God's in Charge NowChapter 7 - The Campaign Starts HereChapter 8 - Stories That Explain and a Message That TransformsChapter 9 - The Kingdom Present and FutureChapter 10 - Battle and TempleChapter 11 - Space, Time, and MatterChapter 12 - At the Heart of the StormChapter 13 - Why Did the Messiah Have to Die?Chapter 14 - Under New Management: Easter and BeyondPart ThreeChapter 15 - Jesus: The Ruler of the World","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DGBFXLSB4W0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062084399#wasThisHelpful","R2DGBFXLSB4W0Z","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say at the beginning of my review that while I don't always agree with Pat Buchanan's prescriptions, his descriptions of what's going on in America tend to be highly accurate and significant. Even if you disagree with Pat's assessment of the trends he chronicles in ""Suicide of a Superpower,"" his passionate portrayal of these trends should be provocative and enlightening for both his critics and his allies.What Pat presents are undeniable trends that are in the process of radically transforming America. It's up to us to debate whether these radical changes are good or bad, but we should thank Pat Buchanan for bringing so many of them together all in one place, and for helping to connect the dots to see how they all relate. We all know that these dramatic changes are provoking a series of crises: we'll all be better prepared to deal with these crises if we know what we're up against. What we'll all have to decide is if we want a Christian nation with the moral, economic, and social fruit of such a culture, or whether we want a more relativistic, socialistic, and atheistic nation.Pat begins in his Introduction with a warning from Soviet Russia: that America is no longer truly a nation, which he defines as ""a people of a common ancestry, culture, and language who worship the same God, revere the same heroes, cherish the same history, celebrate the same holidays, [and] share the same music, poetry, art, literature."" Pat's thesis is clear throughout the book: America is disintegrating before our eyes. ""What happened to the country we grew up in?"" It's a question that I, as someone born in 1960 and someone who shares Pat's Christian beliefs, can identify with.Pat begins his argument in Chapter 1 with an economic argument. I heartily agree with his assessment that our debt is a huge problem and that we have, unfortunately, become a ""food stamp nation."" I also share his misgivings about the role of The Fed in leading to a weakening of the American economy. However, while I agree that China is an economic threat, I don't completely buy Pat's negative assessment of globalization. In ""Suicide of a Superpower,"" because Pat covers so many topics, he doesn't have to make an extended argument, for example, for his view of globalization. The most important statement Pat makes in Chapter 1 is that ""the failure of our system is rooted in a societal failure.""Pat turns to ""The Death of Christian America"" in Chapter 2. Like it or not, this is the root of all of the momentous changes in America in the past several decades. Whether you hate or love the loss of the Christian identity of America, this transformation is the cause of all the others: to a large degree religion creates culture. It's clear from what Pat writes here and what others have written elsewhere that America saw herself as a distinctly Christian nation until recent decades. In Chapter 2, Pat gives but some of the many measures of how we are now much less a Christian nation, from the prayers at Obama's inauguration to the relative collapse of evangelical Christianity to the disintegration of The Episcopal Church. Pat then gives some measure of how the ""death of God has blown up our decent and civil society."" The loss of a Christian American identity has not only created many social ills but has also precipitated what have been called the ""culture wars."" I teach a class on Worldviews, in which I try to help my students see precisely the kinds of connections Pat makes for us. Most Americans only deal with individual issues about which they have feelings and are unable to articulate the theology and philosophy that are the foundations of their beliefs. Once again, Pat leaves us with a powerful and succinct summary of the point he's making: ""the cycle is inescapable: when the faith dies, the culture dies, the civilization dies, and the people die.""Chapter 3 gives us a close up of the Crisis in Catholicism, as one particular measure of the increasing impotence of Christianity in America. This includes not only the disbelief of American Catholics and the decline in the numbers of priests, nuns, etc. but also the cultural bias so many have against Catholics. My sense is that this is because Roman Catholics are the biggest, most prominent church - and because abortion is such a high-order issue for many atheists and nominal Christians.In Chapter 4, Pat deals with The End of White America. He presents some attention-getting statistics from the New York Times: ""whites would become a minority in 2042 and would fall to 46 percent of the population by 2050, comprising only 38 percent of U.S. population under 18."" I can see the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S. as a potentially positive thing. After all, as Philip Jenkins points out in ""The Next Christendom,"" Hispanics are often devout Roman Catholics. But some of the facts that Pat presents has made me have to reconsider what the growth of illegitimacy, the allegiance of many Hispanics to Mexico, and other factors means for America's future.Read Chapters 5-10 for yourself: they are necessary ingredients for understanding why Pat Buchanan and others fear the ultimate disintegration of America as we've known it. The push for equality of outcome, the cult of diversity, a nation that doesn't replenish its population and other disintegrating forces all lend strong support to Pat's overall thesis.I'm fast running out of room in my review, so let skip to a discussion of Chapter 11, in which Pat discusses our ""Last Chance."" While I think Pat wastes too much time at the beginning rehashing some of the problems we face, he finally gets down to a potential solution. He starts with putting the nation's finances back in order, and I agree. This is an issue that has broad-based support, and if we don't solve this problem soon we may not survive long enough to deal with some of the cultural issues. Next, Pat recommends dismantling the American empire. For most of my adult life, I've been in favor of most of America's wars, but more recently I've had to re-think my position. While it's scary to contemplate a world without American intervention, it may, in the end, make us stronger and not weaker. I heartily agree with his proposal to downsize the state, and I think others are starting to agree. But, unfortunately, I think we're all so addicted to government handouts that we'll never have representatives who will vote for smaller government. Instead, I'm afraid that an economic catastrophe will force our hand.Pat's final note is a weak one. I agree with him that we should reclaim a Christian culture and traditional religion and morality. However, Pat offers no real advice on how we can do this! If he's right (and I think he is) that culture follows religion, then he should have offered more advice on precisely this point.In spite of a number of limitations I've mentioned, ""Suicide of a Superpower"" is a provocative, important, and well-written prophesy of where America seems to be headed.Buchanan presents his argument in the following 11 chapters:1. The Passing of a Superpower2. The Death of Christian America3. The Crisis of Catholicism4. The End of White America5. Demographic Winter6. Equality or Freedom?7. The Diversity Cult8. The Triumph of Tribalism9. ""The White Party""10. The Long Retreat11.

"Even though J. Gresham Machen's ""Christianity and Liberalism"" was first written in 1923, it's still a relevant and important analysis of liberal Christianity. Machen writes with great clarity and as one who engaged with liberal Christianity (or ""Liberalism"") in his own denomination (Presbyterian). In fact, he was one of the leading defenders of orthodox Christianity in the early 20th century. ""Christianity and Liberalism"" remains an excellent introduction to the crucial differences between orthodox Christianity and liberal Christianity. It's a book I still recommend to readers.In his Introduction, Machen diagnoses liberal Christianity as not an alternative form of Christianity but as a different religion than Christianity. By showing what Christianity is not, he desires to show in ""Christianity and Liberalism"" what Christianity is. In the remainder of the book Machen supports his thesis about the nature of liberal Christianity in 6 chapters.In Chapter 2 on ""Doctrine,"" Machen addresses the fact that Christianity is a doctrine. This is in contrast to Liberalism which asserts that Christianity is a life but not a doctrine with certain required beliefs. Not so, says Machen, and he capably demonstrates his point from the Bible and the early Church. In Chapter 3 Machen deals with ""God and Man."" Liberalism believes in a God without a moral quality and a God who is not truly transcendent. This in contrast to the orthodox and biblical view where there is a sharp distinction between God and man. The heart of Liberalism, Machen argues, is that there is no such thing as sin.Machen continues to clearly differentiate Liberalism from Christianity in his remaining chapters. These deal with the Bible, Christ, Salvation, and the Church. In every case, Liberalism is found to have a different basis than Christianity. As you might expect, the Bible is not truly the Word of God in Liberalism, Christ is not truly God, and salvation is a light matter because sin does not really exist and man is basically good. Machen also offers some instructive observations about how Liberalism has, in the guise of orthodox Christianity, taken over seminaries and universities, a process that continues in the 21st century.If you've ever wondered why Christianity can seem so vastly different, not only between denominations but even within denominations or how someone can claim to be a Christian without holding any of the historic and Bible bases for Christianity, ""Christianity and Liberalism"" will help you understand these issues. Regardless of your religious affiliation, ""Christianity and Liberalism"" makes clear to its readers the critical differences between two very different approaches to religion: Christianity and Liberalism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R202DC7QAOHYW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1115666258#wasThisHelpful","R202DC7QAOHYW9","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" way back in 1980, shortly after it had come out. At the time I was an aspiring writer who liked science fiction and had a quirky sense of humor and thought: ""I can't believe it! This guy's written the novel I want to write - only he's done it better than I ever could have!"" Since then, I've read the various other books that have come out, watched a TV version of it, and finally the movie version of it. There's nothing else quite like it, and it's filled with a galaxy filled with memorable and improbable humor!If you haven't met Zaphod Beeblebrox or Marvin the Paranoid Android, or the meaning to life, the universe, and everything, then you owe it to yourself to become acquainted with them. In ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" (and the books that followed) Douglas Adams wrote the definitive blend of absurdist science fiction and comedy. Though there's a dark streak running through the book in its assessment of the place of man in the cosmos, it's simply outrageously funny. In my experience it tends to appeal especially to those with highly evolved brains (almost as evolved as mice brains, you might say).

"I first read ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" way back in 1980, shortly after it had come out.

"Zarrella begins his book with the big idea that ""Ideas Don't Spread Just Because They're Good."" What Zarrella has done is to try and provide a theory for how ideas are propagated, a theory which, it turns out, is very useful for anyone who wants his ideas to be shared in the new world of social media. While there are many (too many) works out there on how to take advantage of the social media to get people to read your content, Zarrella's is relatively unique because it rests upon solid science, rather than anecdote or myth. In spite of the scientific framework, ""Zarrella's Hierarchy of Contagiousness"" is an eminently readable book!As an author and book reviewer who is trying to provide good quality content to as many people as possible, ""Zarrella's Hierarchy of Contagiousness"" is a very helpful work. I look forward to continuing to refer to it as a way to help me better connect with potential readers. Having said this, I would have appreciated more content: the book is only about 80 pages long. For example, the explanation of each principle is very brief, and more application and convincing explanation would have been helpful to me.Though short, this is a powerful book with powerful ideas. Remember these 3 words in this order, for they represent the key to producing contagious content, and they form the basis for the structure of Zarrella's book: ""Exposure, Attention, Motivation."" A person must first be exposed to the content you're trying to share (for example, by following you on Twitter). Then the person must become aware of your content by actually reading it (say on Twitter). Finally, the person must be motivated by something (usually your content itself) to want to share it with others.At each stage, you can do something to change the numbers in your favor. You can get more people to follow you on Twitter or receive your e-mails. You can create attention-grabbing content. Or you can include powerful calls to action.Zarrella offers a few ways to gain more exposure. He begins by showing that the ""big seed"" theory is superior to the ""little seed"" theory often espoused. What this means is that it's better to expose your content to a lot of people at the beginning, rather than waiting for the statistically improbably viral tweet that starts small and then miraculously goes viral. Also, you should not be afraid to identify yourself authoritatively with words such as ""guru"" ""expert"" or ""official"". Zarrella offers several other useful strategies for gaining more exposure.He then provides ways to gain more attention from readers. These include personalizing your messages (or at least appearing to!), priming the reader for the content they'll be exposed to, and some very useful information about the best times for tweeting, posting to Facebook, and blogging. Still under the category, Zarrella provides proof for the reasons why people share content. This is a very valuable section filled with tips and a lot of relevant research. In fact, this whole section was very useful, but again, I would have liked a more in-depth discussion and a little more ""how to"".Finally, Zarrella concludes by using the scientific method as a framework for understanding how to create contagious ideas. This was an excellent way to end the book, but once again it left me wanting to read more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLMZBLH2FV0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BP1Y36#wasThisHelpful","R1OLMZBLH2FV0U","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pope John Paul II's ""Man and Woman He Created Them,"" popularly known as ""A Theology of the Body"" may be the most important theological work of the 20th century. I say this because John Paul II is not only a first-rate theologian but also because ""Theology of the Body"" strikes at the heart of a series of related issues that desperately need addressing today. ""Theology of the Body"" begins with the Pope's Trinitarianism, a fundamental doctrine that Christians often don't know what to do with. At the heart of his thinking, and all true Christian thinking, is God's self-giving love that is rooted in the Trinity. ""Theology of the Body"" also explores the nature of what it means to be human and made in the image of God. The book is titled ""Man and Woman He Created Them"" because it is especially in the relationship between a man and his wife that the relational and loving identity of God is revealed in humanity. Throughout, the Pope reaffirms the essential goodness of the human body.""Theology of the Body"" is thus a profound theological work that I highly recommend to pastors, teachers, and educated laymen. Be aware: it's not an easy read! But a patient and thoughtful reading of ""Theology of the Body"" will, in time, become a blessing to the reader. One of the reasons it remains such a timely work is that it confronts some of the Gnostic tendencies in the Church today that spiritualize things and tend to downplay the significance and basic goodness of the body. At a time when humanistic and distorted views of human sexuality and identity abound, ""Theology of the Body"" provides an intelligent and profound rationale for the biblical, Christian meaning of sex, the body, and being made in the image of God.While Protestants may think that a work written by a Pope would be too Roman Catholic for them, in reality ""Theology of the Body"" is a work for the whole Church and all Christians. The book is filled with profound and rare insight into who God is and who man is. It will help to complete the theology of most Christian readers and also has important practical implications.Because the book was originally an extended series of lectures at times it can be unwieldy and difficult to comprehend. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what the Pope means in certain sections, since his writing is often dense. In spite of the difficulty in reading, it's well worth the effort. Because of the depth and difficulty of the work, some have found it beneficial to also read ""Theology of the Body for Beginners"" by Christopher West.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2344N0N0U4I4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0819874213#wasThisHelpful","R2344N0N0U4I4Q","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had an Intex pool for 2 summers now, and it's been one of the best investments I've ever made. However, my old filter had been through a lot, and the pool was becoming overpowered by algae. After some investigation I discovered that the least expensive way to replace my pool's filter was to buy this filter.I've also discovered that it's not that hard to take the filter out, rinse it off with a garden hose, and have the filter look like new. It's nice to have a product that works like it's supposed to and that you've found for a great price.Also, the filter can last a lot longer than Intex suggests it can. You don't need to replace it every week or two: with care one filter can easily last an entire summer.What's not to like?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BURZ878C6Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YSYM#wasThisHelpful","R16BURZ878C6Q5","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""What Color is Your Parachute?"" has become an American institution. This edition marks the 40th anniversary of the book's first publication, and the book has now sold more than 10 million copies. While I don't usually review books like ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" I find that it's such a unique and useful book on finding a job that it's worth encouraging people to read it.My other copy of ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" is a much earlier one, and I can see by comparing it with this new edition that substantial changes have been made over the years. Unlike many other books that don't seem to keep up with the changing times, this new edition of ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" seems tailor-made for today's job market. In fact, ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" has been revised annually every single year since 1972 with the exception of 1975.I like the way that ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" has always been more than just a standard guide to how to find a job but has always helped its readers think outside the box. For example, Chapter 1 of the latest edition is titled ""How to Find Hope,"" and hope is something American workers need in an economy that is uncertain at best and shrinking at worst. Embedded in the idea of hope is a strategy of hope and a principle to live by, which is to not put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, you should always have an alternative: two ways to describe yourself, two ways to find a job, etc. And so the rest of Chapter 1 lists 18 ways to find a new job.Chapters 3-14 go on to describe in detail the heart of ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" which are the 5 survival skills you most need today. These are the following:Attitudes Necessary for Survival (Chapters 3-4)Advanced Job-Finding Techniques (Chapter 5-9)Advanced Job-Creation Techniques (Chapters 10-12)Inventory of What You Have to Offer the World (Chapter 13)Each One Teach One (Chapter 14 on teaching others survival job-hunting)The book concludes with 4 appendixes on Finding Your Mission in Life, A Guide to Dealing with Unemployment Depression, A Guide to Choosing a Career Coach or Counselor, and a Sampler List of Coaches.As you can see, ""What Color is Your Parachut?"" contains much more than just basic job-hunting skills that you can find anywhere else or that you probably already know about. It also gives you a philosophy of job-hunting and of thinking about yourself, as well as advanced techniques for finding a job. For example, Chapter 3 gives advice on how to positively use and think of the time you have when you're looking for a job, and Chapter 7 is all about how to network in this world of social media. It's refreshing to think of the positive uses of the social media, and this chapter demonstrates yet again that ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" always strives to represent the best current practices for finding a job and thinking about job-hunting.I especially like the whole idea of Chapters 10-13, on job-creation techniques and inventory of what you have to offer the world. Rather than seeing oneself as a passive and pathetic looker for a job, why not think of oneself as a creator of a job? In our modern economy it's very possible to do this: it just requires you to think differently about who you are and how jobs are described and offered. Even before I had read this updated version of ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" my wife has done this very thing at least twice. By thinking about her whole set of skills and experiences and using her ability to network, she's talked herself into at least 2 (maybe 3) jobs over the past years, even creating and setting the terms for her jobs.In summary, ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" is an excellent choice for anyone who finds himself in the unenviable position of having to find a new job. While that's never a pleasant situation, ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" will give you greater confidence and hope that you can find a good job, even in a downward economy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYCS6XUQA8H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607740109#wasThisHelpful","R2RYCS6XUQA8H0","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"R.W. Morgan's ""St. Paul in Britain"" is a treasure trove of rare and provocative research into the early Church in Britain. Although the book's title suggests it's primarily about the question of whether or not St. Paul ever went to Britain, the book covers many details about the early Church in Britain that are difficult to find elsewhere. Because of the importance of Morgan's claims and the rarity of the research he presents, his book is a very valuable one, especially to students of Church history or of Anglicanism.Some of the more provocative claims that Morgan substantiates through some painstaking research are that 1) Joseph of Arimathea went to and stayed in Britain c. AD 38  2) Aristobulus (mentioned in the Bible) also went to Britain  3) Prudens married Claudia, the daughter of British royalty and the palace of Prudens and Claudia was probably where Paul stayed in Britain  4) St. Paul himself made it to Britain.The importance of these claims is that the evidence strongly suggests that an apostolic church was planted in Britain in the first century independently of the Roman Church. This apostolic church grew and prospered not just because of the apostolic origins but also because it was suited to make inroads into Druidism in a way in which Roman culture and religion never could. This has implications for how to read the history of Christianity in Anglicanism and helps explain the nature and development of the English Church in subsequent history.I bought this book because it seemed to be the basis for much of Andrew Gray's research in his book ""The Origins and Early History of Christianity in Britain."" The historian in me wants to know if Morgan and Gray's claims have been substantiated more recently (Morgan originally published his work in 1860). However, it seems as if Morgan has plenty of evidence to support most of his claims, evidence that is unlikely to be overturned in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B115PU91QH4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0934666121#wasThisHelpful","R1B115PU91QH4Q","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Chapters in Church History"" by Powel Mills Dawley is part of a series called ""The Church's Teaching."" It's an excellent little historical introduction to Anglicanism that's aimed at the educated layperson, and not at the clergy or scholars. Dawley's main concern is to tell the story of Anglicanism against the broad sweep of Christian history, and the book is a very readable history of Anglicanism filled with excellent insights. In fact, it's a testimony to Dawley's skills that he was able to present as much information as he has in such a relatively small space. He has a knack for making church history simple and readable.The structure of the book is a little odd, but understandable. The first two chapters give a general history of the Church until the time of the Reformation, while Chapter 3 discusses Christianity in England in particular. Chapter 4 then covers the crisis of the Reformation, and the book concludes with Chapter 5, concerning Christianity in the modern world. While I understand that Dawley is trying to put Anglicanism into its historical context, I would have preferred that he discuss Anglican history in more detail and offer less information about the development of Christianity in general. Context is certainly necessary to understand Anglicanism, but in a relatively short book dedicated to Anglican history, more time on Anglican history would have been better.Having said this, Dawley manages to say a lot in a short space. While most of the information in ""Chapters in Church History"" is well-known to me as a student of Anglicanism, Dawley's book is a good starting point for someone who wants an easy historical introduction to Anglicanism. Even though Dawley is aiming at the layman, I was glad to find that some of his insights put things in a new light, even for someone already familiar with Anglicanism.While the book has limitations due to the nature of its intended audience, its size, and its date (it was published in 1950), ""Chapters in Church History"" makes for an enjoyable introduction to Anglican history. More advanced students have many equally excellent works available should they wish to delve deeper into Anglicanism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C9ZPO5KQMSKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140675773X#wasThisHelpful","R2C9ZPO5KQMSKE","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's nice to have this free, Kindle, version of Church's ""The Oxford Movement."" I enjoyed this readable (and affordable!) edition, even thoug sometimes the paragraphs ended up getting jammed together.The Oxford Movement was such a potent force in the Church of England in the nineteenth century that an adequate understanding of it is essential to students of Anglicanism and of the history of the Church of England. The first book written to promulgate an understanding of the Oxford Movement is R. W. Church's 1891 ""The Oxford Movement: Twelve Years, 1833-1845. As the first book on the topic, Church's book has had a large influence on the literature of the Oxford Movement over the years. It continues to be a good introduction to the subject but is lacking in a few ways as well.Church was himself in an ideal situation from which to write such a book, being first a student and then a tutor at Oriel College, Oxford at the same time as John Henry Newman and John Keble. In fact, Church became a disciple and close friend of Newman, which helps explain in part why Church's view of the Oxford Movement is written largely through the lens of Newman and his dynamic, turbulent thought. This is at least one reason why Church considers the Oxford Movement as a twelve year period (from Keble's Assize Sermon in 1833 until Newman's joining the Roman Catholic Church in 1845). Until recently, most scholars of the Oxford Movement have joined Church in reading the Oxford Movement primarily through the lens of Newman. However, Church's work would have been more powerful and useful if it had dealt with the aftermath of Newman's departure and its effect on the Oxford Movement.Church writes with a terse, narrative style and focuses primarily on the principal players of the Oxford Movement. His first-hand knowledge of the people involved is one strength of the book, and his narrative style makes the book easy to read. However, the focus on people means that to some degree a more objective analysis of the meaning and import of the Oxford Movement was left to other writers. Church is clear in his Advertisement that he did not pretend to write a history of the movement or adequately to judge it but intended to preserve a contemporary memorial of a ""true and noble effort which passed before my eyes, with all that was in it of self-devotion, affectionateness, and high and refined and varied character . . . .""In summary, Church's work is a good one but limited in a number of ways.

It continues to be a good introduction to the subject but is lacking in a few ways as well.Church was himself in an ideal situation from which to write such a book, being first a student and then a tutor at Oriel College, Oxford at the same time as John Henry Newman and John Keble. In fact, Church became a disciple and close friend of Newman, which helps explain in part why Church's view of the Oxford Movement is written largely through the lens of Newman and his dynamic, turbulent thought. This is at least one reason why Church considers the Oxford Movement as a twelve year period (from Keble's Assize Sermon in 1833 until Newman's joining the Roman Catholic Church in 1845). Until recently, most scholars of the Oxford Movement have joined Church in reading the Oxford Movement primarily through the lens of Newman. However, Church's work would have been more powerful and useful if it had dealt with the aftermath of Newman's departure and its effect on the Oxford Movement.Church writes with a terse, narrative style and focuses primarily on the principal players of the Oxford Movement. His first-hand knowledge of the people involved is one strength of the book, and his narrative style makes the book easy to read. However, the focus on people means that to some degree a more objective analysis of the meaning and import of the Oxford Movement was left to other writers. Church is clear in his Advertisement that he did not pretend to write a history of the movement or adequately to judge it but intended to preserve a contemporary memorial of a ""true and noble effort which passed before my eyes, with all that was in it of self-devotion, affectionateness, and high and refined and varied character . . . .""In summary, Church's work is a good one but limited in a number of ways. Modern students of the Oxford Movement should especially read Nockles ""The Oxford Movement in Context.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOZFZ6US96B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1153715775#wasThisHelpful","R3EOZFZ6US96B2","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the great mysteries and oversights of history is why an adequate modern biography of John Keble remains unwritten.  It seems a tragedy to me (since I studied Keble for 3 years for my Ph.D. in Religious Studies) that the best biography of Keble is still the first one, written in 1869 by J.T. Coleridge, 3 years after Keble's death.  The most recent biography of Keble is Georgina Battiscombe's ""John Keble: A Study in Limitations"" (1963).  But what kind of biographer subtitles the biography of her subject: ""A Study in Limitations""?!  That all men have limitations is self-evident.  The irony is that the nearly unanimous consensus of Keble's peers and contemporaries was that he was a modern-day saint.  It is astounding that the most recent biography of a man of Keble's stature is now almost 50 years old.  What's even more baffling and disappointing is that no one has bothered to edit Keble's letters.Lock's biography was originally printed in 1893 and was the second biography of Keble to be published.  It's a shorter work than Coleridge's (238 pages in the original edition compared to Coleridge's 568) and therefore less thorough.  On the other hand, as the warden of Keble College, Lock had access to much of Keble's unpublished correspondence and was able to speak with personal friends of Keble.  His work is therefore original, even though it's not as close to the source as Coleridge's.While Lock's biography is not as complete as Coleridge's, his is still a good and useful biography of Keble.  Lock frames Keble's life in terms of the major events of his life (whereas Coleridge offers a more continuous and undifferentiated biography).

"C. Fitzsimons Allison's ""The Rise of Moralism: The Proclamation of the Gospel from Hooker to Baxter"" is an important and careful work about a topic that is more important than it may seem. What Allison is dealing with in his book, after all, is in essence our understanding of the gospel itself. And what Allison has to say about how the Anglican understanding of justification has important ramifications for all Christian thought and life. Allison has written a scholarly but readable book on a very important topic. At times it will be overload for many readers, and yet there's great value in a work that not only addresses an oversight (most writers have ignored or misunderstood the rise of moralism and the great importance of the formal cause of justification) but also demonstrates the practical consequences that theology has, for good or for bad.Allison's thesis is the following: The later Caroline divines within Anglicanism radically altered the Anglican theological synthesis worked out by the earlier Caroline divines and prepared the way for the damaging and still powerful moralism within the Church. More particularly, Allison focuses on changes in Anglicans' understandings of the formal cause of justification, which Allison believes is much more important than we often realize and which has significant consequences for the rest of our theology. Although both earlier and later Caroline divines disagreed with the infusion of righteousness articulated in the Council of Trent, the later divines tended to exalt the righteousness of the good works of men (hence the name ""moralism"") at the expense of the gracious imputation of Christ's righteousness.To prove his thesis, Allison begins by briefly defining the theological synthesis achieved by the earlier Caroline divines. He then sets out to demonstrate this consensus from the works of Richard Hooker, John Davenant, George Downame, Joseph Hall, James Ussher, John Donne, and Lancelot Andrewes. While Allison highlights the general agreement among such theologians, he's also careful to point out where they disagree with one another.Allison then demonstrates the different understanding of the later Caroline divines, through which moralism crept into Anglican theology. He discusses the theology of William Forbes and Thomas Jackson in some detail and that of Cosin, Laud, and Chillingworth in brief. Allison is particularly interested in the theology of Jeremy Taylor whose works of devotion such as ""Holy Living"" and ""Holy Dying"" have been immensely influential. Taylor's theology is very moralistic and even legalistic and emphasizes man's good works and the fact that obedience is necessary before entering into the covenant with Christ. In contrast to his published works, Taylor's prayers and private letters of counsels sound more like the classical Anglican theology. Allison also deals at length as well with the theology of Hammond, Thorndike, and Bull.He then spends 2 chapters dealing with Anglican notions of the formal cause of justification after the Restoration and with the theology of Richard Baxter and those who contended with his theology. In Chapter 9 Allison offers a very useful summary of his entire argument, including a particularly useful list of objections Anglicans had to Trent's notion of infused righteousness. Chapter 10 is also one of the best: it's where Allison provides some historical and theological conclusions about the consequences of the rise of moralistic theology during this period. This includes a brief but fascination discussion of T. S. Eliot's idea of the ""dissociation of sensibility"" that was precipitated in part by the rise of moralism.Allison's work accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. My one criticism is that I would like to have seen a more extended discussion of the consequences of the rise of moralism, as well as some further discussion of how we got from the rise of moralism to our present state. Allison drops some juicy hints and explanations, but more of this (and a little less in certain other areas) would have been helpful. All in all, however, this is a surprisingly important work, given the narrowness of its scope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I30XVUFMST2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=157383257X#wasThisHelpful","R2I30XVUFMST2I","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Annotated Book of Common Prayer"" by Rev. John Henry Blunt is one of many, many erudite works of scholarship that came out of 19th century Anglicanism.  Many commentaries and guides to The Book of Common Prayer have been made ever since the first Prayer Book in 1549, but the 19th century definitely marked the high point for such works, both in terms of the number of works and in terms of the level of scholarship.Blunt's ""The Annotated Book of Common Prayer"" is one of the books that has most helped me, as an Anglican priest, to understand Anglicanism and the Prayer Book.Blunt's book is subtitled: ""Being an Historical, Ritual, and Theological Commentary on the Devotional System of the Church of England.""  This subtitle is unusually important for Blunt is indicating not only that his work is a commentary on the Prayer Book but also that he will provide important historical, ritual, and theological information as the basis of this commentary.  Especially important is Blunt's implicit understanding that the Prayer Book IS The Church of England's devotional system.  Most people misunderstand the proper genre of the Prayer Book: it is not merely a collection of services but has been, in essence, the Rule of Life for Anglicans.  Blunt's work is especially helpful, therefore, because he understands not only the many minute details of the Prayer Book but also has a holistic ecclesiastical perspective to help the reader make sense of the totality of the Prayer Book and it spirituality.Blunt's book is a massive work that contains an amazing wealth of information.  Many other excellent Prayer Book commentaries exist, but Blunt's may be the best of all.  He begins with a wonderful and lengthy Historical Introduction to the Prayer Book, tracing the Prayer Book not just from the first Prayer Book under Edward VI in 159 but tracing things from the early church through the first Prayer Book and then its various revisions up to the 19th century, when Blunt's work was written.  There is enough information in this Introduction alone to make a book, for Blunt goes into great detail about the mindset behind the Prayer Book, as well as the reasons behind the various revisions.Next, Blunt offers a Ritual Introduction to the Prayer Book.  This part of the book includes helpful sections on the principles of ceremonial worship, the musical performance of divine service, and the accessories of the service (including the ornaments of the minister.)In the remainder of the book, Blunt systematically goes through each part of the Prayer Book, offering historical background, theological insight, and practical explanations of each part.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQNZW1KKUFUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G44W9G#wasThisHelpful","RIQNZW1KKUFUJ","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced a flowering of Christian scholarship in England, some of which is still unsurpassed. Out of this period came a large number of works on Anglicanism, such as commentaries on the 39 Articles and books about the Book of Common Prayer, whose immense scholarship continues to amaze me and to be very profitable.One of these works is Evan Daniel's ""The Prayer Book: Its History, Language, and Contents."" Like Blunt's work, ""The Annotated Book of Common Prayer,"" Daniel's work is an encyclopedia of information on the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. (In spite of the amount of detail in Daniel's work, Blunt's work contains even more!) Some editions of Daniel's ""The Prayer Book"" run to almost 700 pages of small font type.""The Prayer Book"" does just what you expect it to: it discusses every part of the Book of Common Prayer in order, in some detail. If you're looking for a better understanding of where parts of the Prayer Book came from, how they've changed, and what they mean then you'll find your answers here. Daniel's ""The Prayer Book"" is a handy, one volume introduction to the Book of Common Prayer. It manages to be both comprehensive and in-depth at the same time - all in one volume.While you can get an idea of what Daniel covers by looking at the Table of Contents of a Prayer Books, here are some highlights of Daniel's work. First, he provides a rationale for the use of a Prayer Book, and then he provides a lengthy history of the development of the Prayer Book that will satisfy all but specialists. Daniel doesn't only discuss the use of the Psalter but also provides a useful list of obsolete words and difficult passages in the Psalter.After presenting a discussion of the Prayer Book in order (which takes up the majority fo the book), Daniel adds an interesting section on Questions for Candidates into Church Training Colleges from 1896 to 1899. He concludes with a more than 100 page discussion of the 39 Articles.I highly recommend it to students of Anglicanism. This is especially true if you can find an inexpensive, out of print, edition of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WW7E9PJCKCAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055QNKGU#wasThisHelpful","R1WW7E9PJCKCAN","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been watching a lot of animated movies with my 5 kids this summer. We just saw ""Monsters vs Aliens"" on the big screen for $1 per ticket on a special deal the local Carmike theater is running. So the price was right, but the movie itself was underwhelming.First, it was very slow in the beginning, even after Susan, the female lead character, gets turned into a giantess with white hair. It seemed like it took a long time for the movie to even get to the monsters, let alone the aliens.Second, even after all of the monsters were introduced, the movie just wasn't as entertaining or funny as I thought it would be. There were definitely moments that made us all laugh, but not nearly as many as in, say ""Megamind,"" or ""Despicable Me."" The Missing Link monster didn't really add anything to the movie, although BOB managed to come up with some of the funniest lines and we all liked his hitting on a mold of green Jell-O!Also, it's more of the same as far as gross jokes, weak-willed men, and strong, sexy women -  in a children's movie.Overall, it was an average, animated children's movie and one that is overrated in a number of ways.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA3O6HGQGG43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GCUO7A#wasThisHelpful","RJA3O6HGQGG43","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The King's Speech"" is a wonderful anomaly!I had a friend recommend it when it first came out. I'm very wary of friends' recommendations because the majority of people are content with the pablum that constitutes most movies these days. But I took my wife to see it in the theater (we watch very few in the theaters) and then again with my 2 oldest children last night!Wow! On so many levels: ""Wow!""First, there is the authenticity. The fact that this is based on history and in history adds extra texture and depth to the film that most films simply can't achieve.Second, George VI (before he was King) manifested an incredibly persistent courage, in spite of his baggage growing up, the gravity and importance of his life, and the disability of his stuttering. This is a very autobiographical issue for me (not stuttering but introversion and other issues) and a wonderful example for my children.Third, the acting is spot on, especially in both the King (Colin Firth) and the speech coach's (Geoffrey Rush) characters. The character of the King-to-be's speech coach is not only humorous but is also a great example of the power and confidence that comes from having mastered one's field.Fourth, the development of the relationship between the Prince and Lionel Logue (the speech coach) is a joy to watch as it unfolds. There are many details that make it an authentic telling of the unfolding of an unusual and instructive relationship. It was also a revelation, watching the second time, that both of the admirable men in the movie, the Prince and his coach, had loving, supportive, wise wives standing beside them (as opposed to Wallis Simpson in relation to Prince Edward (who looks like a complete fool in the movie.)It's ironic that this movie received an R rating for language. Technically, it deserves the R rating, for it drops the F bomb as much as just about any movie. However, it's the one movie I've seen where the use of profanity was actually required by the script and circumstances. The contrast between the exalted station of the Prince and his use of expletives also made the scenes where he used profanity very funny.I've been watching classic films (""The King's Speech"" has all the markings of a classic) with my older kids. One of the things I've pointed out, in watching the original ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""The Killing Fields,"" and now ""The King's Speech"" is that they should notice that great movies don't need a noisy and noisome soundtrack to keep you interested or to tell you how to feel. Great movies can take their time, trusting the story, characters, and actors to tell a truth worth telling.If you haven't yet seen it, ""The King's Speech"" is most definitely, on many levels, a movie worth watching","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203UFD3YIMSKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UESJH4#wasThisHelpful","R203UFD3YIMSKA","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's hard not to love a book that gives you introductions to the following authors and works - and many, many more!Bede and BeowulfThe Anglo-Saxon ChronicleSir Gawain and the Green KnightChaucer's Canterbury TalesJulian of NorwichThomas Mallory and the Arthurian LegendsSir Thomas More and UtopiaWilliam Tyndale, John Calvin, John FoxeThe Book of Common PrayerQueen ElizabethSpencer's The Fairie QueeneSir Walter RaleighMany of Shakespeare's sonnets and 2 of his playsJohn DonneFrancis BaconGeorge HerbertJohn DrydenJonathan SwiftAlexander PopeAnd John BunyanThe Norton Anthology series does exactly what it does: introduces its readers to a smorgasbord of the best of English literature. Don't let the size or price daunt you. The size is worth it for the breadth and depth of content. As for price, there are many inexpensive used editions around, going back to many earlier editions.This book should be on every bookshelf!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBJKX6IG7ZCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393925315#wasThisHelpful","R2GBJKX6IG7ZCJ","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm delighted that my 5 (almost 6) year old daughter loves to read, and I was thrilled that my wife managed to find some books that are at her reading level and yet tell real, and to some degree, compelling stories.But after my 16 year old daughter caught a whiff of the books and told me they may not be so great, I read ""Junie B. Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus"" for myself. On the surface, it's no worse than what my 5 year old has seen in life before. But the fact is that literature does something to us, more than entertaining us. As I learned in graduate school in English literature and have been learning ever since as a father, teacher, and pastor, literature not only delights but (as Horace said) teaches by delighting.So what does ""Junie B. Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus"" teach?1. It teaches that hating things is normal and even funny.""I HATE THIS STUPID DUMB CIRCLE.""""That Jim I hate.""""I hate it in this stupid smelly bus.""2. She calls lots of things stupid.3. Some of the pictures are pictures of how I want my kids NOT to act: going ""Ta Da! Here I am, aren't I cute?"", covering her ears and stamping her foot when she doesn't like something, and giving a sassy and pretentious turn of the head back to another child. I've seen this exact pose on my 5 year-old, and now I think I know where it came from!4. The humor in the book comes mostly from Junie doing things like hiding in the supply closet, wandering the school at will, and invading the nurse's office and dumping out band-aids and playing with crutches and plays with the phone. And, of course, calling 911 and having a fire truck, police car, and ambulance arrive because of the ""emergency"" she claimed to be having.The consequences of all of this? Her Mother (there's not Dad in the book) tells her that what she did was very wrong. That's it.The book is targeted for kindergarteners through 3rd graders. Is this what we want to communicate to them? Is this really the kind of literature that Publisher's Weekly and School Library Journal want to promote?Yikes!","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388OVADYII17C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375841563#wasThisHelpful","R388OVADYII17C","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Gospel-Centered Parenting"" can be summarized in the following slogan by its author, Rick Thomas: ""Less Rules, More Attitude."" The gist of the book is that we need to train our children for the long-term and not the short-term. We need to help nurture children who conform to God's standard from the inside and not from the outside coercion of parents.While the essence of ""Gospel-Centered Parenting"" is sound, there are a few weaknesses in the book. A lot of us parents need to hear the gospel again, especially as it applies to parenting our children.Rick Thomas organizes his book this way. Reading the chapter titles will itself give you a pretty good feel for the book. But Thomas doesn't adequately relate the need for rules and God's Law to the gospel. In ""Gospel-Centered Parenting"" it's all gospel, without an adequate explanation of exactly what the gospel is (Thomas does deal with it, just not in nearly enough depth, since the entire book revolves around the concept of gospel.) This is a major flaw in the book.Another weakness is simply that the book is too short. The very important truths with which Thomas is dealing deserve more explanation and practical ""how-to"" knowledge. I realize the book is a Kindle e-book, which tend to be shorter, and that I only paid $2.99 for it. But the book is incomplete as it stands.Chapter One: The Dangers and Long-Term Liabilities of Pragmatic ParentingChapter Two: Sacrificing Our Children on the Altar of the Sports godsChapter Three: Teach Your Children Less Rules and More AttitudesChapter Four: What Every Parent Should Know. What Every Child Should Do.Chapter Five: The List of Rules We Teach Our ChildrenChapter Six: It's too late. I've messed up. What do I do?In Chapter 1, Thomas focuses on having parents consider the long term vs. the short term parenting and advises that we give less rules and more attitude.In Chapter 2, Thomas makes parents ask themselves the question ""Who do you want your child to be?"" The goal should be (in case you were wondering) for our children to be Christ-like in all things. Parents should be so affected by the Gospel that their children will be as well.Chapter 3 is where I think Thomas makes a major mistake. While he's right that too many of us parents emphasize rules over the gospel, he incorrectly portrays Christ as a rule-breaker. This is the Jesus who perfectly kept the Old Testament Law and the one who taught us the true meaning of the Law (or ""Rules"" or ""Commandments,"" if you want). This is the Lord who said in Matthew 5:17, ""Do not think that I've come to abolish the Law."" Christ was not a ""rule breaker"" but a perfect keeper of God's Commandments or Rules, which we're still bound to obey. We do this, of course, out of love for God, and not some external coercion.Thomas talks in Chapter 4 about the foundational truths that flow out of the gospel and out of loving God. He says that the point of the gospel is change, and in Chapter 4 Thomas talks about the process and goal of change. When we point our children to the gospel, then we will model for them these foundational truths:HumilityGratitudeKindnessServingRepentanceIn Chapter 5, Thomas expounds on each of these characteristics. I know that Thomas has already mentioned love, but why not include it explicitly in Chapters 4 and 5: it's at the heart of the gospel.Thomas gives a few good practical pieces of advice if we think it's too late for us or our children.""It's never too late for your children regardless of their age.""""Let your theology drive your hope and understanding, rather than your feelings.""""Let your theology drive your hope and understanding, rather than your feelings.""""Guard your heart from your children's accusations.""At the beginning of the book, Thomas gives the reader ways to use the book as a ""work"" book and gives the reader some assignments to do in each chapter. He closes the book with a link to 30 related articles.""Gospel-Centered Parenting"" is a good, but insufficient book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASQML53U0CAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00580V8FS#wasThisHelpful","RASQML53U0CAA","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"J.I. Packer's ""Growing in Christ"" is a wonderful introduction to the Christian life. For centuries, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments have been at the heart of catechesis and Christian formation. And these are precisely the topics Packer masterfully presents in ""Growing in Christ."" I teach the confirmation class at my Anglican parish, and ""Growing in Christ"" has been an excellent resource for teaching the fundamentals of the Christian life. Packer also devotes ¼ of his book to baptism and conversion.""Growing in Christ"" is an excellent book largely because Packer writes in a very simple yet deep way that will be a benefit to just about any Christian, young or old, young in the faith or a pastor, teacher, or parent. One of the things Packer does best is to break down the structure of the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments and show how the parts relate. And then he explains each phrase in a way that gives you something to think about. Packer is also good at providing some mnemonics for remembering key points. For example, Packer presents ""provision, pardon, and protection"" as 3 ideas that are central to the Lord's Prayer.Another great mnemonic teaching Packer presents is this triad of 3 C's:The Creed deals with ""Christian Convictions""The Lord's Prayer deals with ""Communion with God""The Ten Commandments deal with ""Code of Conduct""Packer conveys a lot of rich meaning in a book this size. I highly recommend it for new Christians, Sunday school teachers, confirmation teachers, or even more mature Christians who want a deeper grounding in their faith. ""Growing in Christ"" is bound to give you a structure to think and meditate about your Christian life, as well as much profound teaching on how to live as a Christian.The structure of ""Growing in Christ"" is as follows:Part One - Affirming the Essentials: The Apostles' CreedPart Two - Entering In: Baptism and ConversionPart Three - Learning to Pray: The Lord's PrayerPart Four - Design for Life: The Ten Commandments","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQOYJ3KVAGQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581348525#wasThisHelpful","RLQOYJ3KVAGQW","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe if I'd come to this movie cold without what I had experienced for the 4 days immediately prior to watching it, I would have dismissed it as a typical movie with a typical Hollywood happy ending.Other reviewers have written about the basic plot, etc., so I want to challenge you to watch this movie with new eyes. For the 4 days before experiencing this movie I was at a conference for young Anglicans (the Anglican Way Institute), at which the theme was ""Marriage and Family for the Kingdom."" In particular, we had just heard a series of brilliant lectures on parenting, and I had gone to a workshop discussing Pope John Paul II's incredible ""Theology of the Body.""When I watched ""Martian Child"" 2 days ago, the themes of God and His love, what it means to be made in the image of God, and the nature of Christian parenting jumped out at me! I've rarely had a movie-going experience as powerful as having watched ""Martian Child."" Movies have a powerful ability to teach and transform us, but this potential is rarely achieved. ""Martian Child"" is one film that reaches at least some of the potential power of film.I challenge you, if you're a Christian (or even if you're not) to watch ""Martian Child"" through the lens of what it means to be a human: made in the image of God, which means made to live in a harmonious relationship of love with someone who is other than you and different from you. Look at it as a primer on parenting - not that I think that the father, David (played by John Cusack), did everything right. But that itself is the reality of parenting. Look for how self-giving love is what heals Dennis, the ""Martian Child"" abandoned in real life by his human parents, and makes him ""human"" again.As a parent of 5, a school teacher, and a priest, I've made it my life's work to study how to love. ""Martian Child"" taught me or reminded me of a lot what I'm supposed to be doing in order to love and truly reflect the image and love of God.One of the most important things David says to Dennis, more than once, is that he will ""never ever ever . . . "" let him go. And he doesn't. He keeps pursuing Dennis with an unconditional love, even when Dennis steals and hides important things (like keys and driver's licenses) and runs away.The movie makes a subtle but powerful statement about the utterly destructive nature of parents abandoning their children, whether through divorce or psychologically. And it's not just about parent-child love but all love. Any time we humans abandon each other and live out of selfishness, other people and we ourselves get hurt.I like the way that ""Martian Child"" honestly arrives at its happy ending because it was cinematically and psychologically earned as the father manifested unconditional love to a child under a series of difficult circumstances. ""Martian Child"" showed the way the father had to love the Martian child no matter what, how he had to enter into his world, and how he had to shepherd him gently to the truth and to reality. Part of loving Dennis meant challenging his self-destructive self-deception (but understandable as an act of self-preservation) that he really was from Mars.In summary, the movie's theme is well communicated by this exchange between David and Dennis:David: Why did they send you here? You know, the Martians?Dennis: To join a family and to learn human beingness.The final words, spoken by David, also help us remember what we've just witnessed and what has hopefully now become a part of us:""Sometimes we forget that children have just arrived on the earth. They are a little like aliens, coming into beings as bundles of energy and pure potential, here on some exploratory mission and they are just trying to learn what it means to be human. For some reason Dennis and I reached out into the universe and found each other, Never really know how or why. And discovered that I can love an alien and he can love a creature. And that's weird enough for both of us.""It's unfortunate that ""Martian Child"" is not a more well-known movie. But I'm glad that someone introduced it to me and hope this review can introduce it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YLB2YPQI13CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JPT0#wasThisHelpful","R2YLB2YPQI13CJ","AC4Z26E60FBEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC4Z26E60FBEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elizabeth: Renaissance Prince by Lisa Hilton follows the biography of Henry VIII'S younger daughter Elizabeth, whose mother Anne Boleyn was beheaded at the king's best, who was imprisoned in the Tower by her older half-sister Mary, who had an inappropriate relationship with her father's ex-wife's brother, whose own brother became king and fought to change the succession so that their father's sister's granddaughter becomes queen instead of Mary or Elizabeth, and who ultimately succeeded in leading England during a stormy, lengthy period of time.

"In comparison to the standard American over-sugared milk chocolate, this Swiss chocolate was much less sweeter but much better for it. It was sweet without being sugary. The list of ingredients--on the back of the chocolate bar--is also less ""chemical"" than most U.S. brands and more simple: sweetened condensed milk (milk, nonfat milk, sugar), sugar, cocoa butter, cranberries (sugar syrup, cranberries), hazelnuts, almonds, chocolate, milk fat, sunflower lecithin, and vanilla extract.Besides milk chocolate, this particular chocolate bar also includes cranberries and hazelnut/almonds. These were ok, but my favorite part was the chocolate itself, which I found more subtle in taste than the U.S. chocolate, without the sugar overload. Since the nuts and cranberries stick out of the chocolate (rather than get lost inside it). they're easy to eat around to get to the pure chocolate, which was pretty convenient in terms of the way the chocolate bar was designed. This chocolate bar is also decent-sized (6.87 oz or 195g) and not small. Overall, great chocolate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX2TQ3SYW9U6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGIU#wasThisHelpful","RX2TQ3SYW9U6C","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This projector came very well packaged. The projector comes with a power supply cable, remote control, two AA batteries, and a manual with a CD. This projector is lightweight. The size on the Amazon product page is incorrect, since it's smaller than the numbers listed. It's portable and very comfortable to carry around.Despite being a home cinema projector, it can also be considered as a part of a family of multi-media projectors that go well with business meetings or anywhere where they can be placed on a low table (such as a conference table) or a cart on wheels. While the foot release button is present to lift the front of the projector, there's no such button to do the opposite, for example, and lift the rear of the projector while lowering the front.  I don't have a table in my living room where I can place it--only a shelf--so I end up having to put a book underneath the rear side of the projector, in order to project top to bottom.There's also a limitation with setting up the image projection size. It has limited zoom function, so it's hard to coordinate the distance of the projection to get the best screen size. There's also no lens shift.Overall, this is a pretty good budget-friendly (under $1k) home theatre projector that has everything including all the necessary connections. This projector is very easy to set up. It also has 3D capability, which works well with Samsung 3D glasses, that I got previously for about fifteen dollars. This projector also has a built-in speaker. The built-in speaker is fine for small devices, but not for home theatre movies, where you're better off using only sound systems.The image is very bright and has great contrast ration (35000:1). HD movies look great with high quality picture. Even in echo mode, when the fan works quietly, this projector still manages to retain bright picture quality.  It would have been even better if the remote control was a bit bigger and could light up in the dark. In comparison to the 1040 model, this model more closely resembles home theatre quality. For big home theatre fans, I would recommend more expensive Epson models.I was torn between giving this a four or a five, since I like it a lot, and the only reason I'm giving this a four is because of the above limitations. I have experience only with Epson projectors, but have never had a problem with them so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5N89NSSFU7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D7XHDC#wasThisHelpful","R1I5N89NSSFU7N","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Orphan X by Gregg Hurwitz follows Evan Smoak, a former member of a secret government program that used handlers to recruit orphans to work as assassins. As a twelve-year-old Evan was picked and formed a close relationship with Jack. After losing Jack, he decides to go solo and use his skills to help people in need. Evan becomes known as the Nowhere Man and has each person he helps pass his number to another person In need, with the specification that his number can only be passed to one person in need at a time, since he can only handle one situation at a time.After helping Morena, a Latina, save her sister from a child molester police officer, Evan asks Morena to pass his number on to one person in need. A problem occurs when two people contact Evan, both claiming to have gotten his information from Morena. But which of them is the impostor? And more importantly, why? The only thing that quickly becomes clear is that the impostor is being used to get close to Evan, and that his life is in jeopardy from an unknown foe.Overall, it was a decent read. Evan is similar to the typical Hollywood action guy, and there's no shortage of technical devices in the story. The story with the third person in need of Evan's services would have been even more interesting if it started out earlier, was longer and as emotional for Evan as with the second person--that would have made the impostor storyline (which one is the impostor, the second or the third person to contact Evan in the story?) play out even better. All I can say is, I was surprised.My favorite part of this book was the interaction between Evan and his neighbors (the nosy old lady whose main concern is Evan's lack of attendance at the home association meetings, the attractive single mom DA, her adopted son Peter who befriends Evan, and etc.), which was both funny, touching, and made Evan's character more realistic.This book is getting the Hollywood treatment, per earlier reports in the media, so it will be interesting to see how it translates to the screen. I found the writing itself to be very visual and descriptive--whether it's gadgets, violence, or Evan's interactions with other people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VRR9GH23QCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067847#wasThisHelpful","R20VRR9GH23QCM","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Can I go now? The life of Sue Mengers"" is an interesting chronicle of a powerful female Hollywood agent, her rise to the top, and her gradual descent, in kind of rags to riches story. In early childhood, Mengers immigrated with her parents from Germany and settled in New York. Her family struggled financially as all immigrants do. Her mother constantly nagged her father about their poor quality of life, and just as Mengers was entering high school, her father--a heavily in debt salesman--committed suicide by overdosing on pills after unable to borrow money for a loan. Sue's mother re-married, but she and her stepfather were never close.Having grown up, Mengers sought to become somebody. At first she tried her hand in acting by participating in radio skits and taking classes with a well-connected teacher. But pragmaticism soon took over. Shedding the life of an unemployed actor, Sue turned to then next best thing to acting--working in the talent agencies that manage actors. She worked as a secretary at one place, than another. She had brief glimpses of the inner workings of Hollywood, but wanted more. Even on the lower end of the pole, Mengers tried to pass herself off as someone--an agent (even though she was still a secretary)--or at the very least, as having the best things. Ultimately, one of Mengers's former co-workers remembered her when he decided to start his own agency and invited her to come and become an agent. This is what helped Mengers turn from a secretary into somebody. Even though the agency only started out with three clients--all has-beens--Mengers managed to accumulate a big number of clients, including stars and ultimately become a real power broker which was very unusual for a woman.  Her move to Hollywood from New York only solidified her rise. Mengers hosted parties in her Hollywood rental, where she  hosted unemployed actors with directors and producers. Actors mentioned included Barbra Streisand (a close friend of Mengers), Michael Caine, Anthony Perkins, Ali MacGraw, and Faye Dunaway, just to name.Ultimately Mengers became older, and her star power had lost its brightness by the end of the eighties. Despite helping negotiate aside an independent film so that Julia Roberts could star in Pretty Woman, Mengers's contract with William Morris was not renewed. Other agents--younger males like Michael Ovitz--now attracted the star clients, and Mengers's time was up. Ultimately, an interesting and somewhat sad Hollywood tale of a successful woman who climbed her way to the top, and made a name for herself in the Hollywood of the sixties and seventies, closely interacting with the stars of the age. It's interesting but also sad, as new faces substitute old ones, while old faces are left with having to re-live their glory days and are relegated to the has-been status, but with a certain financial well-being, provided that their income--while they were still making it--was invested wisely. Kellow's book re-lives the glory days of Sue Mengers--including the before, during, and after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH017FHM1NKN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670015407#wasThisHelpful","RH017FHM1NKN5","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this projector is a lot smaller than the dimensions listed on the amazon product page. The actual dimensions of this projector are 11.7 inch x 9.6 inch x 3.1 inch. It's very light and mobile, so it's portable and travel-friendly. It's small and easy to carry around, and is great for making presentations at meetings.Since this projector is so small, it would have also been nice if it included a carry-on bag with it (just like some laptops do). The more detailed technical specifications for this projector can be viewed on Epson.com.This projector is described as ""home theater"" but is also for small businesses. Its design means it can be placed on a table. After placing it on a table, the image can be adjusted only by pressing the foot release button and lifting the front of the projector. The button is then released to lock the foot in position. The other side of this however, is that what if the projector can't be placed on a table, but on some less comfortable place--like a shelf. It would have been helpful to have a release button lifting the back of the projector as well--not just the front. While this is not an issue for business presentations where tables are always present, this is inconvenient for a more tight set-up--like a home theatre--where space is more limited and I end up having to raise the back of the projector by placing a book or something else to be able to project it from top-to-bottom (since the front lift is only meant for a bottom to top projection).Overall, for home theatre purposes, this is an entry-level projector. It supports the full HD 1080p resolution, including 2 HD ports (the second HD port supports mobile media devices).This projector includes a built-in mono-speaker, which works well with mobile media devices. For a home theatre, I recommend an external sound system. If an external sound system is connected, the built-in mono speaker should be turned off.The fan is a little bit noisy, but when the sound is turned on, it's not an issue since you can't hear it.The set-up is very easy. Unfortunately this projector lacks a lens shift, which would have made it easier to help configure projector set up image. This projector does have all the basic controls, and a good color and white brightness (3000 lumens). I watched a Blu-ray with it, and I was satisfied with the quality of the projection. It would have also been nice if this projector had 3D, which it doesn't.For a better home theatre experience, the contrast ratio needs to be a lot higher (it's 15000 on this projector) which are available on higher end Epson models. I have only had experience with Epson projectors so can't comment on other brands. However, I have had no problems with any of my Epson projectors so far. In conclusion, I'm satisfied with this projector but keeping the above in mind. This projector is budget-friendly and works well in tight spaces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15XASJPINODB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D7XGNS#wasThisHelpful","R15XASJPINODB4","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice little light gloves, reminiscent of the kind the people in grocery stores use (like at the deli counter, etc.) though they are non-sterile. They are vinyl and anti-microbial, as well as latex free and powder free. They come in a rather big box that houses two hundred pairs. Overall, nice gloves that are light on the skin (they look less likely to cause allergic reactions than other types of gloves) and easily wearable, though lacking any sort of thickness.

"I am a fan of shooting videos and photos, so I have other camera bags as well. Lowepro makes a lot of camera cases and bags, and my experince with them has been positive, This backpack has soft pads on the back for comfort, and the backpack has many departments and pockets. It even houses an entirely separate case inside (on the bottom pocket in the front) in order to put in all the video accessories. The separate case even has detachable sides for ultimate fit. The front pocket (separate from the numerous small pockets) is half-sized, while the back pocket is deep and goes down all the way. Besides housing a video or photo camera and separate small accessories (in the separate case), this backpack can also house things like a chromebook, headphones, tablets, etc. Although I prefer bags that go over your shoulder, which also would have been good, a backpack distributes weight equally and is probably healthier for long travels.

It also has ground and surge indicators. It provides medium-protection for any electronic devices. Just be careful of taking up too much space--a charger or power supply plug, for example, might take  up 2-3 of the outlets or even more. This makes this surge protector limited in terms of the amount of connections it can hold.The power switch is located on the side, which is good since it makes it less likely one might trip over it and turn it off, particularly if it's on the floor rather than hung up.

The included instructions sheet has such tiny lettering, I could barely read it. Lastly, the amount of watts it could put up with is limited to low-watt items.

This feature reminded me less of a home office and more of some sort of workshop.Overall this lamp looks very modern and unique. I would have prefered if the power and dimmer switch was located at the base or at least on the arm rather than on the lamp itself.The best feature about this lamp is that it's power chargeable and doesn't rely exclusively on electricity.Overall, though, it's a nice lamp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMDJ5QPO8VVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW79SC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMDJ5QPO8VVM","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Life among the 1 percent"" by Richard Kirshenbaum is made up of diffent vignettes about Richard's interactions with the wealthy. No names are mentioned, and Kirshenbaum only leaves textual clues as to the topic of the gossip (e.g. ""this seventies movies star, this revered socialite, etc.).Some of the topics covered include real estate (most celebrities In New York --no matter how rich are relegated to living on West Side, because the ""old money"" doesn't want to interact with showbusiness types), difference between East Coast and West Coast (to survive in New York, one needs real money versus in L.A. one can ""pretend"" to be rich without that being the case), extreme dieting habits and restaurant snobbery (from the chef and the staff, not the wealthy eaters), and excessive maintenance and ""man-scaping,"" as well as the dating scene post rich-hubby divorce (the new divorcees can select between having a companion, having a lover, or marrying money but can't have all three). Other topics include entitled offspring and the ever present pressure to ""keep up with the Joneses"" among many other topics. The author is a journalist and at least a part of the vignettes in this book have previously been published in ""The Observer"" and can be read on its website (which gets you accustomed to the author's writing style and the topics covered).This was a light read, with the content focusing on the superficial side of being rich (private drivers moonlighting as babysitters, etc.) rather than the practical part (how the wealth was accumulated in the first place). Even so, this was an interesting read and study into the lifestyles of the very wealthy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AF644NI3GP00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504007328#wasThisHelpful","R1AF644NI3GP00","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""My Paris Dream,"" Kate Betts--an established fashion journalist--chrinicles her life in Paris during the late eighties and early nineties. After graduating from an Ivy League university in the mid-eighties, she searches for her calling and realizes she wants to fulfill a Parisian fantasy that she always had. Betts secures an internship at a magazine in Paris through her godmother's husband and moves in with a Parisian family. The magazine pays minimum wage and Betts years for something more. Through the French family she stays with, she meets a Frenchman called Herve and begins dating him. Herve is into hunting and Betts uses the experience to write an article that later gets published. The article catches the eye of Fairchild, a prominent American publisher who publishes magazines like W and Women's Wear Daily. He hires Betts for the Paris bureau, and Betts covers the latest It news for the American high socity before moving into what she believes is the ultimate career-maker--fashion, where she meets the likes of Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld.Throughout the book, I always had the impression that Betts' life in Paris was not going to be permanent (as well as the French boyfriend) and I turned out to be right. Throughout the book, Betts chronicled her infatuation with Paris--at one point even stating that she couldn't divide her love for her boyfriend and her love for Paris, seeing it as one whole (this one should have been a clue about the fate of Betts' relationship with her french boyfriend). Betts envies the effortless elegance of the French and their focus on family and recreation over career (it's not uncommon for the French to take an entire month off from work during the summer), even as she feels that she will never be fully accepted into their society (she is often referred to as ""the tall American"" in her interactions), can't exactly mimic the French style of dress no matter how hard she tries, and feels homesick for her native New York. Despite living in Paris, Betts works with expats and that perhaps is one of the main signs about her lack of full integration into French society.Overall, this was an interesting memoir about living in Paris (which was the part that interested me) and working as a fashion journalist and attending fashion shows (for those interested in fashion). The author's Paris experience recounted in the book is mostly limited to late eighties early nineties, though some of the events recounted in her memoir--such as Paris terrorist attacks--were happening in the eighties but are just as relevant today. It would be interesting to read a memoir taking place in contemporary Paris.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H77QDXOKU33S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679644423#wasThisHelpful","R1H77QDXOKU33S","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The main character of â€œThe Fixerâ€ is Rick Hoffman, a journalist who is left unemployed after a calm existence in a well-paid job, working in a magazine for the wealthy. All of a sudden the magazine owner noticed that the magazine is not profitable, and decides to switch it to online format only---either firing most of the magazineâ€™s employees or making them freelance. To make matters worse, Rickâ€™s girlfriend makes him move out of their apartment and he has no place to stay. Rick goes to his childhood home, whose only inhabitant was his fatherâ€”a lawyerâ€”who has long since stopped residing there after suffering a stroke and moving to a nursing home.Inside his childhood home, Rick accidentally discovers over three million dollars in cash, hidden in the wall. And thatâ€™s when his problems start, as Rick starts getting followed and starts receiving threats. He wants to find out where the money came from, and visits his fatherâ€”who canâ€™t speak, but lets Rick know with a gaze that the money isnâ€™t hisâ€”which leads to Rickâ€™s obsession with finding out how the money ended up in his childhood home.I found this to be a very lively but deep read, as Rick recollects his childhood memories and thoughts about his fatherâ€”attempting to imagine and assess his life.

"The action takes place in the capital of Czechoslovakia, Prague, in the 1950s. World War II had just ended and Czechoslovakia was under the influence of the Soviet Union, sharing the same defense fears and terrified of penetration from Western spies. The victims of this political regime are ultimately a husband and a wife, as the husband is arrested after a false accusation in espionage. After he is arrested, the wife gets fired from her job and begins to work in a movie theater as an usher. As the authorities pressure the husband to confess to something he didnâ€™t commit, they also get the crazy idea that the wife was involved in espionage as well. In order to prove their guilt, the Czech officer in charge of the investigation comes up with an unthinkable idea.Even though this book takes place in the 1950s, it was a very interesting read. As I was reading it, I imagined a black and white movie of the events. Itâ€™s terrifying to imagine living in that country during that time, under such a political atmosphereâ€”when anyone could say anything about you and you could never defend yourself.

"In ""Invasion of Privacy"" by Christopher Reich, Ian is a billionaire, owner of a computer company, who wants to live forever and is ready to take whatever is needed in order to prolong his life. The idea of death for him is inconceivable. He develops computer technology for the FBI and kills his competitor in order to acquire his technology--obsessed with the idea of a supercomputer. However the FBI is divisive in their reactions: One side of the FBI is very interested in Ian's technologies, while the other side wants to know about the death of his competitor. An FBI agent is involved with the investigation of the competitor's death, while Ian pays an FBI official money in order to stop the investigation.However when Ian realizes that the investigation still continues, he orders to have the FBI officer conducting the investigation--Joe Grant-- to be murdered. His wife, Mary Grant, is left to pick up the pieces and doesn't trust anyone--including the FBI, who deceives her about what really happened to her husband. Mary risks her own life as well as that of her daughters when she decides to investigate her husband's murder herself--with the aid of a journalist.I found the read to become more interesting later on in the story, from the middle onwards.

"""The Billion Dollar Spy"" follows the story of Russian engineer Adolf Tolkachev who worked in a research institute where he was involved with the development of sensitive aviation technology--before deciding to betray his country and hand over as much sensitive information as possible to the CIA, to inflict maximum damage on the Soviet Union. Spoiler alert: This isn't a Hollywood movie, but real-life. Things do not end well.While this book is about Tolkachev, who spied for the CIA in the late seventies early eighties, it also anecdotally mentions other spies of the time period who ""went over to the other side,"" so despite Tolkachev's story being the main one--you learn about other real-life spy stories as well. The first thirty pages of the book in particular was devoted to describing the Cold War atmosphere of the time, and giving a bit of a background on the spy-situation at the time. For a while--back in the fifties/sixties--CIA had no spies in Russia at all. Angleton, who headed the CIA, was too paranoid to trust anyone--confident that any volunteer spies were actually a ploy by the Soviet Union to provide disinformation and deceit, and to attempt to entrap CIA officers.Against this history of paranoia, it was impossible to get anything done. It wasn't until Angleton was no longer in the CIA--in the seventies--that things changed. Against this backdrop, this story introduces us to Tolkachev and the invaluable information he provided, as well as other spies who risked their lives. Oftentimes the motivation given is ideological, but to me that's a bit too simple. I once read a memoir where the author--who was a member of the intelligence community--noted that spying is almost never done out of ideological reasons--it's done either for financial gains, out of blackmail, etc. But the point was it's always personal. Hoffman delves into the tragedy of Tolkachev's wife's family as part of the explanation, but she was not the one doing the spying and her story isn't Tolkachev's. It would have been interesting to gain a deeper psychological picture of Tolkachev and understand why people like him do what they do. As I was reading this, I honestly couldn't understand why he did what he did. In the end, he was just one lonely man against an entire system--and predictably, the system ate him up.Overall, this was a moving and tragic book. if you like reading about real-life spy stories (CIA officers changing disguises, dead drops, spying in a hostile environment, paranoia about being followed, and all the other interesting espionage-related things), you'll find this a slightly dated (story mostly takes place in the late seventies early eighties, with intervals that take place in the previous decades when we hear about other spy stories, family backgrounds, etc.)but an interesting read that is well documented (there are almost thirty pages of sources at the end of the book).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLFWGVI4N23O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537603#wasThisHelpful","R2WLFWGVI4N23O","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this faucet to be very impressive---unfortunately the product page doesn't include all of its advantages (which I only learned about after receiving it) and is very brief in describing it.This faucet came well-packaged in a pretty big box with 6 batteries, in addition to other parts. This faucet is expected to run for up to two years with the six AA batteries.The faucet's handle can control volume and temperature for both electronic and manual operations. With the handle on the position ""on,"" the handle can be grabbed or tapped anywhere on the spout or faucet handle with an arm, forearm, or wrist to start and stop the flow of water. I think this is a good feature if my hands are full and I need to turn the water on, or if I don't want to touch the faucet with a dirty hand.This faucet has an auto shut-off feature as well, which means that the faucet automatically turns off after running for four minutes. I think this is a good feature as well, since that means even if I accidentally leave the water running and forget to turn it off, it will still turn off by itself and you won't get a large bill.In addition, I also like the fact that the LED light changes from blue to red as the temperature of the water changes.  This is helpful if I want to wash something under a certain temperature, and don't want to take the time to feel the water temp with my hands first--I can tell if the water is or cold just by looking at the color.The downside is the long installation--which takes several hours (assuming the faucet fits) and should be done by a professional to ensure high quality.

"In comparison to a previous shower curtain that I reviewed--that was lace and had nothing to do with the actual shower--this is a true shower curtain. It's purely polyester and holds the water in well. It comes with its own shower hooks and bath mat, which is also purely polyester and comes with a foam insert and PVC backing.At first it was a little confusing to figure out where to hook the shower hooks, as there were no visible holes for them in the fabic (and no information prsent in the package). So it was helpful to view the product description page photo--white is up (at the top of which were the little holes for the hooks), multi-colored design is down.The name describes this set's use as being for kids and teens, which I agree with. The bright pink/fuchsia design is certainly more suitable for them than for adults. This set is also affordable and good for using in small spaces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SANIBQLVLJFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGVAGQU#wasThisHelpful","R2SANIBQLVLJFE","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This certainly is an elegant lace curtain, but it's not for the bathroom. For starters, it's not just white--it's see-through. Imagine you're taking a shower and one of the people living with you accidentally steps into the bathroom--the curtain won't be much help.I also found this curtain to be very thin and not very good for preventing water from seeping right past it, when taking a shower.The curtain itself is attractive, but should not be labeled as a ""shower curtain"" since it's purely decorative, without serving any other purpose. It's better suited for a living room, bedroom, whatever--just not the bathroom.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCY25SNHBZSJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDHSK#wasThisHelpful","RCY25SNHBZSJA","A16YMCFWGSFGS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16YMCFWGSFGS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Comfort zone? Whatâ€™s that:  Iâ€™ve read a whole lot of books the last few years. Iâ€™m pretty comfortable in the romance genre, and honestly, I didnâ€™t think I had any firsts left, but I was wrong. I havenâ€™t really been drawn to post-apocalyptic books (though I love The Walking Dead) and I wasnâ€™t sure about this one. Iâ€™d seen good things about Ms. Smithâ€™s earlier works, but I mean, weâ€™re talking about stories involving possible non-consensual sex/rape, alien/non-human heroes, violent and brutal worlds that are as far from safe as you can get.So...yeah. I was like, no thanks. Not my cuppa. I like being the fluffy bunny. Then I hit a bit of a book slump, and my twitter friend Lexxi spoke so highly of this, I couldnâ€™t resist. I am so glad I listened to her.  R. Lee Smith showed me why I should risk my cottontail every once in awhile. She took me by the hand and lead me into a world that dominated my thoughts for days, left me wrung out and loving every bit of it. Told from third person perspective of Lan, the world is merciless and it captured my attention in ways I did not anticipate.Brutal world: Azrael is Lord of the Beautiful Dead, able to raise the dead, though he himself is not a dead man. He simply cannot die. He unleashed The Eaters (aka zombies) on the living, took over the world and now resides in what is left of England, in the capital he has renamed Haven. Lan, after the death of her mother, travels from her small village called Norwood, for an audience with Azrael. Lan and Azraelâ€™s battle of wills takes center stage through most of the book, as Lan asks for Azrael to end the Eaters. Azrael has vowed to never end them, as they protect Haven and its inhabitants. Lan is just as determined to change that, since theyâ€™ve almost wiped out the human race, and her mother turned into one. She never wants anyone else to suffer that devastation, seeing their loved ones turn into mindless eating monsters.Erotic Horror: I think this was a good warning for me, and I didnâ€™t go into the story thinking I was getting a straight romance. Itâ€™s not, though I love that the romance is a big part of this twisted tale. There arenâ€™t wild and crazy sex scenes, though most have an unexpected heat. Iâ€™ve seen it described as having elements of a horror fairy tale, and I think thatâ€™s as close to the mark as anything else. Macabre and creepy at times, sweet and heartwrenching at others, I couldnâ€™t look away.Suffering, thy name is Azrael: Azrael is in my top 5 ever tortured heroes, ever. The atrocities heâ€™s committed and the atrocities heâ€™s had committed against him, helped to shape him and you really get a chance to understand his actions. He is not a bookboyfriend that is going to captivate you with his amazing looks. He is horrific to look at, but his tender side, and his connection with Lan, make you melt and root for him to find love with Lan. Azrael has other mistresses, or dollys, as Lan calls them, and normally I would shy away from this with a vengeance, but I could accept this because of emotionally, itâ€™s all Lan, no contest.Lanâ€™s emotional journey is fantastic: The story is from Lanâ€™s perspective, even if told in third person, and you get to see the best and worst of her without filters. Funny enough, her best and worst feature is the same - her stubbornness. It is admirable at times and frustratingly bullheaded at others, but sheâ€™s never dull and I appreciate her honesty. Sheâ€™s not perfect but sheâ€™s as fascinating as Azrael in her own right.As in any good fairytale: You need huge obstacles, torture, tragedies, and ultimately a HEA. There is all that and more in this story. At approximately 751 pages, itâ€™s a long read. I love it but be forewarned that this takes its time unfolding and I spent the last 30% or so finding myself in tears at the most unexpected moments but I closed my kindle with a smile on my face.I think it could be edited to tighten up the plot, but I loved exploring every facet of this world. The secondary characters that populate this, from Mr. Wickham, Lanâ€™s tutor, to Serafina, Lanâ€™s caustic and hilarious handmaiden and Deimos, the unwittingly sad captain of the Revenants, they all left their impression on me. Each contributed moments that enriched this story and made this world come as alive as a tale about the dead can get.Please ignore the cover: If thereâ€™s anything I didnâ€™t like about this, it would be the cover. No, itâ€™s not even remotely good. In fact, Iâ€™d go so far as to say itâ€™s pretty shiteous, but that is not an indication of the writing within. Really. If I had judged this book by its cover, I would have missed out on an excellent read.The Bottom LineSo emotional, haunting, bittersweet yet hopeful all at once, itâ€™s hard to put it into words how much I enjoyed this read. Itâ€™s one of those books that will stay with me long after I turned the last page. My favorite of the year. I highly recommend this for those willing to enter this post-apocalyptic world. I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XW5RX7AT50A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017CEASMG#wasThisHelpful","R2XW5RX7AT50A7","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good: The old â€œin love with my brotherâ€™s best friendâ€ trope has a bit of twist here - Andrew, a player for the Chicago Aces hockey team, was taken in by his best friendâ€™s family when his father died and his mother was basically useless. Heâ€™s grateful for their care and their love and as a consequence, he would never think of getting together with Jenna, his friend Connorâ€™s baby sister Jenna. Except he totally wants to. Jenna has been in love with Andrew forever and a day, but other than one passionate weekend, she thought it would never happen. They both come home to Jennaâ€™s parentsâ€™ home for Christmas. Just the family...and Jennaâ€™s boyfriend, Jon. With that setup, I was definitely interested and novella length seemed like the perfect amount of reading for me at the moment.The Bad:  Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t work that well for me. The first book was light and fluffy, but it had some humor. This novella was a bit more on the angsty side than fluffy, which is fine. However, I struggled to connect with Andrew and Jenna. I understood why Andrew was scared of losing the familyâ€™s love and support, I understood why Jenna tried to move on with Jon. It was when my emotions should have engaged that I just didnâ€™t. It was when my emotions should have engaged that I just didnâ€™t, and I was honestly, a bit bored by it. The angst was mild, the boyfriend angle was mild, it was all just mild.Everything in Between: The writing, while it didnâ€™t engage me, was fine, if flat. The characters were likeable enough. I donâ€™t remember Andrew from first book, doesnâ€™t matter since itâ€™s completely separate story and the first bookâ€™s characters really donâ€™t come into play until the end. It would be easy enough to read this without reading the first book.The Bottom LineI usually love hockey romances, but this wasnâ€™t clicking for me. The writing wasnâ€™t bad, I think it was just a case of â€œitâ€™s not you book, itâ€™s my mood.â€ Overall, It was an okay read, and I would check out the next book in the series.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SD7M60EW1KVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNE45JA#wasThisHelpful","R2SD7M60EW1KVM","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two for two: This is the second Jennifer Dawson book Iâ€™ve tried in the past couple of months and the second one Iâ€™ve really liked.  I went into this story blind, as I didn't realize it was part of a series, but I was not lost or in need of reading the first one to enjoy this book. Note: Of this trio of friends (Leo, Michael and Brandon) I found myself desperately intrigued with Brandon and I want his story soon. Pretty please?Back to this story - I love that Ms. Dawson can work a well established trope (best friendâ€™s sister romance) and do it well. This talent is sorely underrated, because itâ€™s not easy to take something thatâ€™s been done before and make it still fresh and interesting. Thatâ€™s due to her way with character development. Thereâ€™s a solid supporting cast of family and friends rounding out the â€˜verse, along with excellent sexual chemistry between Jillian and Leo.D/s dynamic is smokinâ€™ hot: From reading the blurb, I didnâ€™t guess that the D/s in BDSM was in this. I was pleasantly surprised at the way it was done. This is much more about domination and submission than bondage but thereâ€™s just enough spice here to kick things up a notch. The scenes between Leo and Jillian are pretty intense and their attraction for one another really worked, but that is because there is time taken to demonstrate their history and connection with each other. The Firsts (meet, kiss, love scene) were firing on all cylinders and thereâ€™s just enough jealousy that brings out the possessiveness in Leo, which I love to read.Jillianâ€™s a good heroine: Beyond my surprise at the D/s, I was also intrigued with Jillian and her emotional journey. Jillian has wanted Leo since the moment she met him at her brother Michaelâ€™s graduation from the police academy. She is on her last ditch effort to get him to see her as more than just Michaelâ€™s baby sister or sheâ€™s walking away. When she realizes that Leoâ€™s into domination and control, she doesnâ€™t run, sheâ€™s intrigued and she asks legitimate questions that I would ask if I were in her shoes. I loved that sheâ€™s known to be a bit flighty by her friends and family but really, sheâ€™s the most determined one in this relationship. I thought her actions during their big obstacle was fantastic and I found myself really liking her, even in her slightly dramatic moments.Leoâ€™s issues: Leo is harder to get a bead on at first. Heâ€™s been irrevocably traumatized by the loss of his twin brother through violence. It drove him to become a policeman, and heâ€™s built up some impressive emotional walls. Usually a hero whoâ€™s all domineering but emotionally closed off drives me batty, yet here, I think Ms. Dawson spent a good amount of time giving a basis for his emotional problems and the fact that this is done in dual POV gives the reader a good amount of time in his head. When he feels that he has to do something that he hates just to please Jillian, I wanted to yell at him, but to his credit, he messes up but he gives good grovel and he finishes strong, just the way I wanted.The Bottom Line [4 stars]I really enjoyed this. If youâ€™re into D/s in your romance, Iâ€™d say check this out. Ms. Dawson, if you can give Brandon his HEA soon, Iâ€™d love to read it.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IVRAPG43YU49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BR5HBI#wasThisHelpful","R1IVRAPG43YU49","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good: Canâ€™t complain about novella length smut with a good amount of sex, and just enough of a story that it doesnâ€™t feel like just sex. The tension between the brothers and the competition for Angelina was a little different than every other MFMM menage, though the rest of the story does follow the fairly standard formula.Everything in Between: There was nothing really objectionable with the story...or particularly compelling. There are some curious moments considering these are brothers, and the thought of swords crossing, even when itâ€™s all focused on the heroine, isâ€¦.yeah, itâ€™s a bit weird. Angelinaâ€™s reluctance fades away fairly quickly, considering how long she was gone.The Bottom Line - 2.5 stars (I round up)This is short, smutty and sweet.

"The Good: Never read anything by Ms. Paige before, but I did enjoy the time spent setting up the â€˜verse for The Heavenâ€™s Rejects and the war with Twisted Tribe. Itâ€™s crude, rude, misogynistic and violent, and pretty much exactly what I expect from an MC romance. This book doesnâ€™t shy away from the violence, so itâ€™s about a 4 on the WTFery scale. The war and the action sequences were dramatic, though I would have loved to see more time spent with it, since it's the strongest part of the book.I was settling into for a trainwreck of a romance - nothing wrong with that in an MC romance, because alot of them are dysfunctional at best. Honestly, some of the most fascinating MC romances are such big trainwrecks that you canâ€™t look away from them. However, this one suffers from a case of split personality.The Not So Good:  It starts dark and gritty and I expected a really messed up but strong connection between Dani and Hero. Unfortunately, itâ€™s not really developed well and as a result, I just didnâ€™t buy it. For the bulk of the first half, they either didnâ€™t know who the other was, or they were cursing each otherâ€™s existence. There were no conversations, little more than a physical attraction that isnâ€™t acted on much. Also, thereâ€™s continued contact with others - I can deal with that because they werenâ€™t in a relationship, but itâ€™s not pleasant.Then, a little more than halfway through, say 60-75%, it swings into the mild, sweet territory that was jarring considering the tone of the first half of the book. The attempt to build up a non-existent romance between Hero and Dani just didn't work. One moment, thereâ€™s barely any talk between them that isnâ€™t a threat, and then suddenly theyâ€™re in love. What I struggled with more than the insta-love was the saccharine sweetness of the way they expressed that insta-love. When theyâ€™re in the last place I expect a biker romance to go, and thereâ€™s â€œcolorful bombsâ€ bursting in the air over their heads, I really debated whether it could come back from this.Everything in Between: The story is uneven, and while it swings wildly into way-too-sweet-ville, it starts to pick up again once again to resolve the mystery of Daniâ€™s past. Unfortunately, it lacked that emotional punch to really resonate with me. The villain is a complete unknown for shock value and is EVIL for reasons. Also, the setup to drive Dani into the villainâ€™s arms felt way too contrived and over the top.Had the story melded the two sides (the current MC war and Daniâ€™s mystery) together from beginning to end, it would have had some real impact. Some of Heroâ€™s backstory just doesnâ€™t make much sense (I thought he was 29 but looking at the timeline objectively itâ€™s like heâ€™s older than that). Doesnâ€™t matter because 20s or their 30s, Dani and Hero just come off as very immature, searching for drama for dramaâ€™s sake and itâ€™s not done very well.Lastly, I have to comment on the editing/grammar - there's a serious need to re-edit this book again. Normally, I can gloss over typos or the occasional missing word because that happens even in the traditional published works. However, the grammar is noticeably bad, the missing or extra words numerous and it was very obivous. I'm hoping that these errors were corrected in the final version of the book.The Bottom LineIt was ok, and the MC club action was the most compelling bit of the story. Unfortunately, I just didnâ€™t connect with the romance. This is the first in the series for Ms. Paige, so I wouldnâ€™t rule out a return to this â€˜verse, because there were bits that had potential.**ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review**","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCXQJTWN6JPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JW8ZB4#wasThisHelpful","R1YCXQJTWN6JPX","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: An ex-military hero who lost his hand and part of his during his service, and an agoraphobic heroine? You just donâ€™t see that every day. Their physical and mental issues, respectively, are dealt with in a believable manner. I enjoyed the fact that the story is told from both their POV, because I need that balance to the story.The Bad: Unfortunately, there is a lack of spark when it comes to the romance and it made everything feel stiffer than Jakeâ€™s artificial leg. I think in the desire to be accurate regarding Jake and Natalieâ€™s issues, the story felt stilted. Both Jake and Natalie have severe cases of insta-love and I just didnâ€™t buy it. Intrigued? Possibly, but they were practically in love before Jake set foot in her apartment. It really hindered my enjoyment. Add to this the fact that the villains can practically be spotted from space and I rolled my eyes more often than is probably good for my vision.Everything in Between: I guess I was more intrigued with Jakeâ€™s friends Ian and Kaga more than the romance I was reading, so if anything I might give their books a shot.The Bottom LineMeh.

"The Good: Itâ€™s a Kindle Unlimited read and itâ€™s super quick. Itâ€™s like cotton candy - fun while youâ€™re eating it, and melts away the second it hits you. I like the series, but itâ€™s not Shakespeare. Not every book has to be, but this definitely falls under guilty pleasure.The Bad: The story is intriguing but barely developed. Itâ€™s pretty repetitious and the resolution is super obvious which...whatever, I enjoyed myself for what it is. The way the heroineâ€™s weight is addressed is just trying to make this into a â€œmessageâ€ book, and it does it badly. I applaud making a heroine curvy or plus size. I donâ€™t need it hammered home at every opportunity. Itâ€™s just too much.Everything in Between: I love that the coverâ€™s a bit better than the earlier ones. I would have liked to see more focus on the emotion between Becca and Vikter. I canâ€™t stress this enough - thereâ€™s a good idea, but more focus on the romance and less on the â€œmessageâ€ would have made this loads better.The Bottom LineItâ€™s ok.

"-The Good: It was the title. Titles and covers can hook me in, even when I should know better. That title sucked me in and had me hoping for something a bit over the top, a bit sexy and a bit funny because câ€™mon - virgin billionaire cowboys donâ€™t grow on trees. I am a big proponent of taking the virgin hero trope and running with it. Iâ€™ve read about 35 year old virgins before (within the last month, if you can believe that) so I know it can be entertaining.-The Bad: Unfortunately, it just doesnâ€™t work here. There is a decided lack of energy and fun to this tale and I was really surprised by it. The reasons for staying a virgin felt contrived at best and a hero whoâ€™s nagged at constantly by his mother isnâ€™t sexy in the least. Matt and Dara have very little sexual chemistry and frankly, Dara has bigger cojones than Matt does.-Everything in Between: There were good ideas that just seemed to get lost in translation.

"Full review can be found at https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1343609419 and http://afterdarkbooklovers.com/I really enjoy Ms. Meaderâ€™s writing: Iâ€™ve read Ms. Meaderâ€™s Hot in the Kitchen series, which was great fun, so I looked forward to checking out this book. I was not disappointed. At first, I was just enjoying myself, but as I got deeper into the story, I couldnâ€™t put it down. When 4am rolled around and I found myself saying ""just one more chapter,"" well, I had to admit that I'd found myself a five star read.Diversity rules: Both of the series by Ms. Meader that Iâ€™ve read so far are set in Chicago, and I do appreciate that these characters do not exist in a lily white world. Thereâ€™s a variety of characters that come from different social, economic and ethnic backgrounds, even within the Dempsey family since theyâ€™re comprised of adopted and foster kids raised by Sean and his wife . I love that sheâ€™s taken advantage of the ethnic diversity instead of ignoring it. It lends a richness to the tale being told and I, as a Latina, always appreciate seeing minorities in leading and supporting roles in my romances.Work and play: Alex is a female firefighter, one of very few in her department, which is sadly very realistic. Her love to hate on Eli Cooper, the hunky mayor with diametrically opposite political views is integral to their struggle to be together. Theyâ€™ve butted heads in the past, but when Alex saves Eli (and he saves her right back) during a fire, they are thrust into a â€œfakeâ€ relationship to help Eliâ€™s re-election campaign. Personal and professional collide and I couldnâ€™t have been happier. Ms. Meader has created fully realized characters with personal and professional lives. They donâ€™t exist simply to service the romance, but have jobs and careers that influence every aspect of that romance. And their banter? At times crude, but always damn funny.Alex and Eli have combustible chemistry: Chemistry is like pornography - itâ€™s hard to define, but you know it when you see it. Alex and Eli have that IT. The story is told in third person POV so you get a good perspective on both of their characterâ€™s feelings without it becoming all about their inner monologues. As you can see below, thereâ€™s dirty talk (yay!) and the way Eli loves to dominate in the bedroom was smoking. It did verge on the guilty pleasure side for me, since he was pretty Me Tarzan, You Jane. He never crosses the line (too far) into alphahole territory though, and when he got bossy, I got buttery. The unresolved sexual tension (UST) they had in the very beginning kept humming just underneath the surface of all their conversations and some of the unintended dirty things that Alex said made me laugh out loud. I love romances where the protagonists canâ€™t help but antagonize each other then have mad passionate sex. This has that in spades.Eli, sexy ass caveman: Eliâ€™s love of Firefly notwithstanding (and let me tell you, that got ALOT of brownie points with me), he IS a big ole chauvinist. I struggled with his caveman tendencies, even if I firmly believe it makes sense for the character. I mean, is he super alpha, and super hot? Yes. However, his need to dominate Alex at times felt more patronizing than sexy, at least at first. I completely understood Alexâ€™s desire to kiss and punch him and Iâ€™ll admit it got my feminist hackles up.  Having said that, the deeper I went into the story and the more of his motives and pure love for his Alexandra is revealed, I just MELTED like Olaf on a summer day. Yes, heâ€™s a politician and has his share of flaws, but that makes him three dimensional instead of bland. That protective, slightly obsessive love and his grand gesture was just swoonworthy. Iâ€™ve added Eli to my stable of book boyfriends.Alex is my kind of girlfriend: I love a heroine I could see myself hanging out with and Alex is that kind of girl. Sheâ€™s tough but open to love, and even if sheâ€™s occasionally protective, she doesnâ€™t just push away Eli for the sake of pushing. She made me laugh with her ability to work an innuendo and she was NOT shy when it came to sex. She can be irrational, especially when angry at Eli, but again, like Eli, it made her human and three dimensional, instead of a Mary Sue. Her love of her family, her strength of character, and not just accepting less for herself had me admiring her.The Bottom LineIf you couldnâ€™t tell, I loved it. When I feel the urge to re-read a book right after Iâ€™ve finished it, I know itâ€™s going on my keeper shelf. This is a highly entertaining read that I would recommend to fans of firefighters and contemporary romances. Iâ€™ll definitely check out more in this series.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98JIPXSVL5A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI7Q4#wasThisHelpful","R98JIPXSVL5A3","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good : Sex and humor with dominant wolf shifters and the badass babes who love them. Thatâ€™s the Phoenix/Mercury Pack series in a nutshell. It works for me. I like the relationships that Ms. Wright has built between the wolves in the Phoenix and Mercury Packs and thereâ€™s alot of little bits that mean more if youâ€™ve read that earlier series. Thereâ€™s still the possessive, protective, mine! vibe, but itâ€™s not something that just explained away by â€œitâ€™s fate.â€ Ally and Derren have good chemistry and scenes where they get to connect through their childhood traumas to give a good foundation to their relationship beyond the usual insta-love thing youâ€™d expect from shifter romances, which I like.The Bad : Iâ€™m just tired of yet another crazy jealous female villain. It makes the formula feel more like a formula when you know itâ€™s going to be some crazy chick whoâ€™s crazy because you need a crazy chick.Everything In Between : There was a little bit of the human/shifter tensions and I would have liked to see that overarching storyline developed more. The deeper connection through anal play just makes me giggle. And the tease of Allyâ€™s BFF whoâ€™s like a brother, and his brothers? I want more please.The Bottom Line [3 ½ stars]I liked it. If youâ€™ve read the Phoenix pack books, Iâ€™d give it a shot. If you havenâ€™t, but you like shifter romances, Iâ€™d give the series a shot.**ARC provided by author via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SUZ1DL23MTSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3N0NDU#wasThisHelpful","R3SUZ1DL23MTSF","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: Luc and Camâ€™s story was one Iâ€™d been waiting on since the beginning of this series. Friends to lovers is a favorite, and the fact that Cam had finally let go of her infatuation with Z (the hero of the first book) gave me high hopes for this story. I love that it features a sport not often portrayed in romances, has a female athlete whoâ€™s at the top of her game as the heroine and the boarding scenes still have their own excitement and energy that helps pull the story along. The sex was good and I didnâ€™t have a problem believing in their feelings for each other. And finally, towards the end, the scenes where Cam and Luc finally pull their collective heads out of their butts were enjoyable. That said...The Bad: This is a personal preference, but when the hero or heroine have deep-seated insecurities that lead them to jump to conclusions, wellâ€¦I canâ€™t stand it. Lucâ€™s a deeply insecure hero and thatâ€™s not sexy. Camâ€™s oblivious in her own way, and thatâ€™s also frustrating. Add them together, and I spent way too much time wanting to smack them upside their heads.Also, this bitâ€™s spoilery, so if youâ€™re not into that, look away now. Seriously. Ok, for the rest of you....SPOILER ALERT I was unhappy with the time jump and realizing that Luc was hooking up with randoms. Yes, he was brokenhearted and drunk out of his mind. Donâ€™t care. Hated it and it really didnâ€™t endear me to him. It just made him seem weaker to me. END OF SPOILER ALERTEverything in Between: At the heart, Cam and Luc really needed to grow up. There is growth, but I have to admit that it felt all packed in at the end, past the point where my patience had frayed.The Bottom LinePerhaps my expectations tainted this, but it ended up being just an ok read for me.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXLH3RP59WUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD7JM#wasThisHelpful","RDXLH3RP59WUB","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: The blurb really pulled me in. I loved the thought of seeing two wounded souls dealing with their issues, and if one of those souls is housed in a hot MMA fighter hero, all the better. Roryâ€™s injury was horrific and led him down the path of booze and pills to forget the pain and the loss of his career. Clareâ€™s had her share of pain and is doing all she can to escape her horrible, abusive ex. The setup was good and I was in for the ride.The Kavanaughs and their little corner of the Bronx almost has the feeling of a small town and thereâ€™s potential with the rest of the brothers (of course there are several just waiting for their turn at love). I think my favorite part was Ace, and the scenes involving working with abused animals. Those were the best and really showcased Rory and Clareâ€™s best attributes.The Just Okay: Unfortunately, the spark wasnâ€™t as strong as Iâ€™d hoped it would be between Rory and Clare. Perhaps it was a few too many references to their insta-connection and how they didnâ€™t really know why it was so different between them but it was. When the characters make comments like â€œI feel this [insert intense thing here] but I donâ€™t know whyâ€ then usually I, as the reader, donâ€™t know why either.I can get into a story that has unbelievable elements easily. I mean, I just read a book with a 35 year old virgin mercenary, so clearly Iâ€™m willing to suspend disbelief. However, the one thing that must ring true is the romance. Since that didnâ€™t click for me, when it came time to suspend disbelief that Rory could overcome his addictions simply through his love of Clare, it fell kind of flat. I was mostly disappointed with the missed opportunity to really give the story some depth through Rory's struggle to stay clean, and how Clare's past could play into that. What was done was mostly surface. The drive towards the end was a bit slow and the entire story with Clareâ€™s ex felt somewhat underdeveloped, since we donâ€™t really find all the details until the end and even then itâ€™s just sketched out.The Bottom LineIt was an ok read. That said, the setup for the series isnâ€™t bad, I would probably give it another shot and see what happens with the other brothers.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PGS8VI49XM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VD043F4#wasThisHelpful","R28PGS8VI49XM6","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-The Carpinos get better and better: Iâ€™ve enjoyed the earlier books in the series and seeing that Paige was the heroine for this book certainly drew me in. The Carpinos are a slightly crazy but fun, loving family who step up and protect their own and nowhere does that shine through as well as it does here. Ms. Asher has managed to grow as an author which each book and Iâ€™m excited to see what she has in store for the Carpinos, because so far, I think each story has its own little spin and itâ€™s own flavor that helps keep the interest alive.If youâ€™ve read my reviews, I need certain key scenes to be right on point for my enjoyment. I like to call them the Firsts - first meet, first kiss, and first love scene. Paige and Cam have a great first meet when he dumps a Dr. Pepper all over Paige. It sets up their antagonistic banter, and the action ramps up when they realize that Paige will be watching Camâ€™s kids after day camp for a week, since sheâ€™s filling in for her sister whoâ€™s in Hawaii. First kiss was sexy and and first love scene was...ok not what I was expecting considering what had just happened, but still brought good heat. The UST was good and it was easy to keep turning the page, even when alot of the tension came from Camâ€™s tendency toward alpha-hole.-Cam drove me a bit mad: Cam's a bit of a pushy a-hole at times, but I think I need that at times from the hero or heroine or thereâ€™s no conflict. Too perfect makes me crazier and Cam is far from perfect. His tendency toward caveman gave the story a bit of spark, moreso than if he was too easygoing. He had trust issues, and heâ€™s not the type to flat out say Iâ€™m sorry. He could run roughshod over Paige, but she managed to give attitude back to him enough times, though I wouldnâ€™t have minded if sheâ€™d done more.I would have liked him even more and possibly raised my rating, if he had that big moment where he shares and give a great apology, doesnâ€™t have to be a grovel but a truly soul-baring kind of moment makes up for alot. That said, he was never so alpha-hole that I couldnâ€™t connect with him, and it is clear that he cares alot for Paige.-Paige is still spunky: Paige Carpino is the youngest sister of Tony, the hero from the last book. Sheâ€™s been sheltered her whole life but that hasnâ€™t hindered her personality. Every member of her family tries to protect her and basically wrap her up in cotton batting, but Ms. Asher managed to convey that this protectiveness was born out of love, not because Paige was TSTL.-The storyâ€™s stronger:  This is what I want to focus on as the best part - I enjoyed the earlier books even when I thought the stories were a bit scattered, or lack tension.Athica Lane is Ms. Asher starting to hit her stride. I think itâ€™s the most cohesive plot of the series, and the threat that emerges was real and organic to the plot and woven well into the narrative. I liked that while some parts of the story stuck to the stereotypical (Hi Bekki), the big climax does not and the â€œvillainâ€ isnâ€™t just ev-ill for the sake of ev-ill. Also, the relationship conflict was so natural and when they inevitable happens, I loved that it made sense to these characters.-Even with the moments that could drive me a bit nuts: As much as I liked that the villain was integrated well and drawn in an almost sympathetic manner, I have to point out that the stereotypical, and completely useless ex wife, wasnâ€™t. It was an easy out storywise. Admittedly, I prefer when characters arenâ€™t drawn in broad strokes for the sake of simplicity and Bekki was just a basic bitch. Also, the resolution to Camâ€™s bit of asshattery was a bit too easy and verged on too violent. His tendencies toward explosive reactions wouldnâ€™t be cool in any type of real life situation. I didnâ€™t agree with Rosaâ€™s advice, because I think he shouldâ€™ve worked a bit harder for Paigeâ€™s forgiveness.The Bottom Line [4 stars]I really enjoyed it. Itâ€™s the best of the series so far. It drove me a little crazy, but I think itâ€™s that bit of bitter that made the sweet all the better. Paige and Cam â€˜s romance was fun and Iâ€™d recommend it, especially if youâ€™ve read the series so far or love KA-style books.

"-Excellent take on an old tale: The opposites attract trope is a tried and true formula and the professor and the bombshell is something Iâ€™ve read plenty of times. Gracie is a small town baker who is in Chicago for her best friendâ€™s engagement festivities and sheâ€™s thrown together with James Donovan, the nerdy stuffed shirt Donovan brother. They fight like cats and dogs whenever theyâ€™re in the same room together and they are convinced that they know what the other feels about them. It could easily move into familiar territory with James being a stuffed shirt and Gracie being a ditzy blond, but I loved that neither of them fits precisely in their predetermined roles. The fun starts when they stop fighting it and start dealing with their attraction, and getting to know the reasons why each has decided to let the world believe what they want about them.When Iâ€™m reading a familiar tale (and letâ€™s face it, 99% of romance isnâ€™t about reinventing the wheel), what separates the best from the rest is the execution. I think Ms. Dawson has done extremely well with crafting some sympathetic and interesting characters, solid banter and ultimately making the obstacles that James and Gracieâ€™s relationship face play out in a believable manner.-Part of series yet stands alone: This is the third book in the series, which I didnâ€™t know going in, but Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t let that stop me. I was curious about the romances for Cecelia/Shane and Maddie/Mitch, but it didnâ€™t hinder my enjoyment of this story whatsoever. Thereâ€™s enough backstory supplied that I didnâ€™t feel lost or missing out on any goodies.-Smoking hot chemistry: I thought James and Gracie had phenomenal chemistry and the anticipation built steadily with each and every scene, until I just wanted to scream at them to â€˜just do it already!â€™ - I love when book makes me do that. Their first date was great and I read it more than once. The first love scene was compelling and squirm-inducing. Best yet, it was chemistry that translated outside of the bedroom.They have excellent scenes where you see James AND Gracie them get past their preconceived notions of the other. Their arguing was filled with unresolved sexual tension and I certainly connect with it.  I have a very rational husband who can drive me NUTS when he calmly ignores my rants, so the final payback when James finally sees it made me laugh out loud. They also had a wonderful playful side (hence the bookâ€™s title) and the games they played in and out of the bedroom were sexy and fun.-My quibbles: I wasnâ€™t really expecting the better living through sexual domination moment, which was ok, but I think needed a bit to flesh it out. Also, I have to admit that James calling Gracie â€œbaby girlâ€ seemed a bit off, considering his personality. I loved that he wasnâ€™t just a stuffed shirt, but personal nicknames should seem to fit the rest of his dialogue and it sort of didnâ€™t.The Bottom LineA pleasant surprise, I really enjoyed this well executed take on an old trope. Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more from Ms. Dawson and more about the Donovans.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3Z1ND3K3WF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT30ZE#wasThisHelpful","RT3Z1ND3K3WF8","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another Hitman book? Yes please: When I finished the last book, Iâ€™d wondered where the series would go next, since it felt like it was closing a chapter on the original overarching storyline. When I saw that the Tears of God, a group introduced in Last Breath, reappears to pick up where the original group left off, I was as giddy as a schoolgirl with a new boy band CD.When the story begins, Rafael Mendoza and his crew are following Ava, whoâ€™s been roped into being a mule for a nasty criminal to show buyers some documents for a potential auction, though weâ€™re not sure what it is. The story has the usual action and danger youâ€™d expect in a Hitman book, but with a fantastic amount of sex that wasnâ€™t present in the last book.Rafe is fantastic...ly huge: Now letâ€™s face it, most romance novels love to emphasize the size of the heroâ€™s package, but here, Rafeâ€™s has a monster of epic proportions (Ava calls it Godzilla), something I havenâ€™t read about before. Like possibly life threatening and vagina-damaging.Thereâ€™s enough discussion of Rafeâ€™s penis to make any size queen clench in joy. But itâ€™s anything but joyful for Rafe. As a matter of fact, heâ€™s been tortured his whole life, told by his horrible mother that heâ€™s the devilâ€™s spawn and that his cock is the reason for all the evils of the world, from global warming to Donald Trump.When women literally fear his penis, well I could understand that itâ€™s given him a complex and his sexual experience is limited, to say the least. When the first hints arrived as exactly how inexperienced he was, to say I was shocked would be an understatement. I mean, a 35 year old almost-virgin mercenary is pretty incredible. However, it somehow worked. It gave him a vulnerable and incredibly sympathetic edge that had me panting to snuggle him...and defile him.Avaâ€™s a mother hen heroine: You know the type - the one who has to save her friend, who takes care of everything, even to her own detriment. Thatâ€™s Ava to a T. She sacrifices herself to be a mule when her best friend Roseâ€™s boyfriend reveals himself to be the nasty scumbag he is and threatens to kill Rose if she doesnâ€™t. Sheâ€™s flying by the seat of her pants through most of the book, and it would be easy to make a complete damsel in distress but she pulls her weight when the occasion calls for it and she knows when to hold on, no matter how noble Rafeâ€™s trying to be.Maybe too much sex?: Before you slap me, I didnâ€™t mind it and actually loved Rafe and Avaâ€™s relationship. However, the focus on Rafe and his sexual experience and monster cock was a bit of a distraction and for the most part, the action is definitely secondary to the romance and sex. Even a bit implausible in life or death situations where the last thing Iâ€™d be thinking of is sex.When I think back to the actual suspense, it didnâ€™t feel like it really came into play until very late in the game, and even then it kind of ends with a whimper not a bang. Well, except for Ava and Rafe, who were banging like a screen door in a hurricane. Since the romance is what brings me to the party, it (mostly) worked for me, but if youâ€™re looking for an intricate plotline, it wasnâ€™t the strongest in that respect.The Bottom LineI really enjoyed Rafe and Avaâ€™s romance, even if the suspense part of plot itself was a mite thin. That said, the setup for future books with the Tears of God group has me intrigued. Iâ€™m eager to see what happens next.**ARC provided by author for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277Q6CCZUCBPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFS4#wasThisHelpful","R277Q6CCZUCBPR","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: I think the sci-fi is strong and interesting. Xiaâ€™s backstory is heartbreaking and the worldbuilding is fascinating. Thereâ€™s alot of detail but I didnâ€™t feel overwhelmed by it at all. There is a glossary but I think alot of the terms are clear in the context of the story. It's the second in the series, and while I hadn't read the first book, it didn't affect my enjoyment of this one. If anything, I'm curious how I'd feel towards that first book, since I like the world.The Bad and Everything In Between: The part that I had the hardest part connecting to was the love in the love story - it didn't feel particularly strong to me. Cal fell hard and fast and Rahal and Xia just have a different sensibility about their bodies and sex and love in general. When the love declarations came, I wasn't sure I bought them, because they felt more insta-love than anything else. I think that's why it took me a bit to get through the story, since I found it easier to put down and just read a couple of pages at a time.Considering two sides of this triad are felinoid, the catlike responses and posturing made it feel almost like fetish play. I say almost because the sex was tame for a menage type of romance. It wasnâ€™t blisteringly hot, but it wasnâ€™t fade to black, it fell somewhere in the middle. Also, occasionally the very references that make the story unique felt a bit *too* cute (constantly referring to sex as sexytimes for example).The Bottom LineI liked it. The sci-fi was interesting, even if the love/menage story wasnâ€™t as strong. If you like an interesting sci-fi world with a little bit of menage, you may enjoy this.

"The Good: I have a soft spot for the screwball comedy. The slightly ditzy heroine whoâ€™s convinced sheâ€™s right, even when sheâ€™s horribly wrong? The one who stumbles into danger and yet it all works out for her? Depending on how itâ€™s done, I can get behind that. It can be fun, escapist fantasy, and thatâ€™s what this book is - kinda crazy but fun with a dash of romance. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Ms. Caseyâ€™s writing in the past (I enjoyed Shine Not Burn), and this is has her humor all over it. It starts with some pretty funny texts between May and her sister Jenny and ends with May being way more than the ditzy chick she seems to be at first.  Also, big dog/little dog as a secondary love story? I was #teamFehara all the way.May, a wedding photographer whoâ€™s much more Ann Taylor than badass, ends up in a shady biker bar and everything goes to hell in a pee purse. Sheâ€™s been receiving texts from what she thinks is her sister, giving her weird cryptic instructions to meet her at Frankieâ€™s. When May gets there, she understandably sticks out like a hooker at a Sunday church social. The madness grows from there, but the strength of the book is in the security firm and May learning the ropes for her new and exciting job. The camaraderie between the characters, the training that May goes through, the nickname they give her, all add up to some cute and funny scenes.The Bad: The setup for May to work with BSB hinges on your ability to suspend disbelief...as well as not being completely disgusted with Mayâ€™s TSTL actions. I will admit, I laughed out loud at her sisterâ€™s texts one minute, and then wanted to smack May upside the head the next. The choices she makes to end up where she does beg for a head slapping. That said, I think itâ€™s due to Ms. Caseyâ€™s talent that I understood that it was a choice to make her do those things to position her for the rest of the story, and May really grew on me by the end of the tale, kinda like a fungus.Everything In Between: When I say thereâ€™s a dash of romance, thatâ€™s all it felt like - the spice on top of the tale of May and her badass training. Sweet moments, just not enough of them. Also, this is first person POV and itâ€™s all May, all the time. Thatâ€™s fine but it narrowed the â€˜verse and left me wanting more from everyone not named May.I liked Ozzie, though I would have loved to see his character fleshed out more and the ILUs didnâ€™t resonate for me because there was little time spent developing the relationship. Itâ€™s set up for an ongoing series, so Iâ€™m hopeful that the other guys will eventually get a bit more playing time.The Bottom Line [3 Â¼ stars]I ended up liking it, even if May has some serious TSTL moments that made me wonder if I would.

"-New to me author: When I looked up Nona Raines on Goodreads, Iâ€™d had no idea that she has so many books out, or that this novella was actually a sequel of sorts to her book, Read to Me. It didnâ€™t hinder my enjoyment of this story, but it does make me want to seek out more by her. I like Ms. Rainesâ€™ writing style, with a lyrical slant without getting flowery and a good amount of descriptors to set the tone.-Interesting setup: I liked that Bryan and Gloriaâ€™s meeting through a half-written letter left in a book of poems, an unusual opening gambit for a love story. Gloria has a soft spot for the romantic outpouring and Bryan is more than willing to use that for a chance to get to know Gloria. The misunderstanding is crucial yet believable.-Gloriaâ€™s a strong Latina heroine: I adored that Gloria is Latina and it informs alot of little moments throughout the story without becoming the focal point. That sheâ€™s loved and lost and is confident in herself and what sheâ€™s achieved is admirable and even when the inevitable happens, I really liked that she stood up for herself and called things as she saw them.-Novella length hinders development: I truly wished that the story was longer and more time spent in giving Gloria and Bryan more time getting to know each other. The transition from attraction to love was very quick and told to the reader instead of being shown, and shortcuts were taken to wrap up the story with the final reunion being sweet but rather abrupt.The Bottom LineI liked it. I think the writing was interesting. I only wish it had been a bit longer.**ARC provided by author for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35V19Y8II36VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XZTVBM#wasThisHelpful","R35V19Y8II36VJ","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Carpinos are crazy fun family: Ms. Asherâ€™s managed to set up a full little â€˜verse with the very large and loving Carpino family. Iâ€™d read the first book in the series, Overflow, a while ago, but it was very easy to jump back into the mix. The family relationships and get-togethers were comfortable and funny. Paige is the next Carpino up to bat, and she features alot more in this book, making me want to read more about her.Itâ€™s a standalone, butâ€¦: While I think you could read this book on its own, it would be helpful to read the earlier book just to get the feel of the whole family and the events of the first overlap a bit with this one, so it will spoil several plot points for the first book. For a second writing effort, I think it shows continued growth and potential, and it didnâ€™t feel like a carbon copy of the first book.Leighâ€™s been through alot:  Between her childhood surrounded by her skanky mother and junkie sister, she didnâ€™t have alot of love in her life. Her BFF Gabby and her family brought her into the fold, but itâ€™s never the same when you have nothing but negative from your blood family. Then her horrendous relationship with her ex Preston (which, ew) made her feel about two inches tall. Her self esteem is shyte and thatâ€™s not necessarily easy to read, though it is in keeping with what sheâ€™s suffered. She has  What I would have liked to have seen is Leigh have some time to build herself up, and not rush into a relationship with Tony, because she needed to love herself before she could love someone else. Though with Tony, I couldnâ€™t blame her for falling into a relationship with him.Tonyâ€™s a pretty great alpha hero: Tonyâ€™s just what the doctor ordered for Leigh after her scummy ex beats the stuffing out of her. Heâ€™s as ideal as possible. Even his pushiness is perfect, because he never ignores her needs and makes sure to take her feelings into consideration at every turn. Honestly, he may be too ideal, but again considering everything Leigh suffered at the hands of pretty much every person that was supposed to love her except her friends, yeah heâ€™s just what she needed.The way he brought Leigh out of her shell was so sweet, from taking her to the mall to people watch, the fun of their car shopping adventures to adopting a Golden-doodle named Finland, he makes all the right moves. Thereâ€™s not a moment of eye-roaming or tension with another woman, so this is a completely safe read. Which...Needed more external tension: Overall, the weakest point of the story is that there is no real tension from anything except Leigh and her self-esteem. The external obstacles such as her family, her ex or the situation involving Tonyâ€™s client, werenâ€™t integrated as well as they could have been to really give some urgency to the plot.I guess itâ€™s the difference between a decent dessert and a gastronomic delight - itâ€™s the ones with a little more bitter that really make that sweetness pop. The obstacles werenâ€™t incorporated as thoroughly as they could have been, more like sprinkled on top. The leadup to the big climax was integrated better than in the first book, but still felt obviously inserted just for a dramatic moment. It was easy to put down, and a little bit more of a struggle would have been welcome to give a little more weight to their HEA.The Bottom LineI liked seeing the Carpinos again, even if I would have loved some more tension in the story. Iâ€™m looking forward to the third book, Athica Lane and more time with the Carpinos.**ARC provided by author for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4U74RJECTQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLQNW28#wasThisHelpful","R1X4U74RJECTQR","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got it in a timely manner.

"A Stylo virgin: Iâ€™d never read a Stylo Fantome book before this, though she comes highly recommended by my girls on After Dark, so I was interested. When I saw the blurb and the cover for this book, I couldnâ€™t resist. I was concerned with the start and my lack of love for Marc (more on that later), but the writing style is on point, and I love when an author can take me on a ride and make me, kicking and screaming, come to care for her characters.Thereâ€™s another book and Iâ€™m good with that: I hesitated a smidge when I realized that this was not a standalone, but rather a duo with the second book coming out in December of this year. Iâ€™m happy to say that Ms. Fantome has managed to craft a satisfying book that ends on a To Be Continued that didnâ€™t leave me wanting to chuck my kindle. Most serials or multi-book series can drive me bonkers because frankly, they feel incomplete, they arenâ€™t meant to be read on their own and I hate reading half a story. This is NOT the case here. Best Laid Plans doesnâ€™t answer every question but it does have a satisfying payoff to a couple of plot threads, and leaves me wanting more.Lily is far from a do nothing bitch: Lily has been working for five years to get close to Stankovski, so she can avenge the death of her sister. Sheâ€™s done anything and everything, short of murder, to position herself to do this. Sheâ€™s capable and smart, yet imperfect enough to connect with and she saves the day, more than once under crazy tough circumstances. She thrives under pressure and thinks well on her feet, which is just what you need with a story like this.Excellent action: Hitmen/mercenaries? Kickass heroine? Action spanning a continent with loads of danger and hot sex to boot? Yes please. The action sequences are crazy, the fighting intense and the ultimate showdown kept me hooked, wanting to make sure that Lily ...ok yes, and Marc were alright. I would have liked some more follow through with certain plot points such as the Liberian gang, which felt as if it were essentially dropped to give closure to this particular book. Since it is a two parter, Iâ€™m reserving the right to be thrilled or less thrilled, depending on if they come up in second book. Speaking of booksâ€¦.Kingsley Law needs his own: Book, I mean. And woman, ultimately. While I thought he was a desperately needed character to shed some light on Marc and his dunderheaded thinking, I would like to see what woman would pair well with him since I do think Marc and Lily click (which trust me, I didnâ€™t think at first). Heâ€™s a solid secondary character who manages to steal most scenes heâ€™s in and made me really want to let him have his dirty, rough way with me. I connected with him in a way I didnâ€™t with Marc because, wellâ€¦Marcâ€™s a little lotta bit of a DICK: Truly this makes complete and perfect sense for his character. He is a cold blooded mercenary who has managed to stay alive and do it well by shutting off his emotions to do the job needed. Heâ€™s a cocky arrogant ass who REALLY made me want to nutpunch him in the beginning. Then at the end, he made me want to nutpunch him again, for completely different reasons. I ran the gamut of emotions with him, bad and good. While I do think he works well with Lily, Iâ€™d never think of him in terms of book boyfriend material.Thereâ€™s alot of violence in this romance: A big part of the hurdle for me getting behind the romance part of this suspenseful tale is the violence, in particular between Marc and Lily. Had there been scenes in the beginning showcasing their attraction and their friendly banter before their ONS and before the feces hit the fan, I could have handled the violence better. It took me a long while to soften towards him, though it did happen...against my will. The fact that Lily could go toe to toe with him and beat him when the occasion called for it, brought back a balance to the relationship that ultimately worked for me.The Bottom LineWell written, exciting mercenary romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. Iâ€™d recommend for those who love good action and suspense with their romance and can handle violence, between the leads and everyone else. Is it December yet?**ARC provided by author for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RPL2R03417UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KWCNL8#wasThisHelpful","R1RPL2R03417UR","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-The Good: I loved that hockey plays a big role in this romance, but not just on-ice play, but behind the scenes action, which was interesting. I think itâ€™s the strongest of the series in that respect. Gray being the GM of the Cold Fury gave an added layer that I really appreciated. Sheâ€™s a decent heroine who is working in a manâ€™s world but sheâ€™s feminine and has believable struggles choosing between her personal life and the career sheâ€™s worked towards her whole life.Ryker is perfect. I mean, when the story begins and heâ€™s braiding his little girlâ€™s hair. Even my shriveled up ovaries fluttered. He is a Gary Stu, and while immensely likeable, he was uber-perfect. He said and did just the right thing, every time and if I had to pick my fave Cold Fury hero, heâ€™d be it, no question.-The Bad: This is a style thing, but each time, the story is told in dual POV, and thereâ€™s always some scenes that are told via recap as opposed to playing out in real time. It has a bit of a diary-like feel to it, and alot of times thereâ€™s some beats that feel as if Ms. Bennett explains a bit too much, leading the reader with a heavy hand, instead of allowing the story to unfold naturally.-Everything In Between: The villain was obvious, and everythingâ€™s wrapped up in a pretty bow at the end. Itâ€™s very safe and a tad predictable. The whole story has a fairy tale quality. I didnâ€™t mind it, sometimes those reads are just what Iâ€™m in the mood for, and this is one of those times.The Bottom LineI think itâ€™s my fave of the Cold Fury books - I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the plan, but I think itâ€™s the perfect way to wrap up this series. If you like your heroes perfect and your sports themed romances on the low angsty side, Iâ€™d recommend it.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11S2CUR0XPZV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OXC0#wasThisHelpful","R11S2CUR0XPZV1","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-Great football with my romance: First of all, Iâ€™ve been in a bit of a slump lately and Iâ€™m so glad I finally got to this book. It was the perfect pick me up. I loved that the author clearly has an understanding of the game and is willing to really make it part of the heart of the book, as opposed to just the sporty headband slapped on top of a romance.Itâ€™s inspired by Elle Kennedy and Kristen Callihanâ€™s new adult series, and you can see it throughout. The humor, the camaraderie between the characters, the friendships, itâ€™s all just geared up perfectly for a ongoing series. I loved that this didnâ€™t feel like just an excuse for a perfect physical specimen like Knox (which, letâ€™s face it, yum), but I loved the little sports trivia woven into the narrative, and the game sequences had a cinematic quality to them. I could definitely see this as a film.-Ellie is a good heroine: Ellieâ€™s had a tough go of it, always considered an extension of her brother Jackâ€™s life by her parents, her only purpose to get him through school. She makes alot of mistakes and she struggles against being with Knox because of her secrets, but I liked that about her. It made her human. It was necessary because, damn.-Knox is perfect: I mean he really is the male Mary Sue. Heâ€™s physically intimidating and gorgeous. A football god at Western, he is focused, driven. Every woman wants to bang him and every man wants to be him. And the literal cherry on top, yes heâ€™s a virgin. Thereâ€™s nothing he canâ€™t do. And while heâ€™s the sweetest thing everâ€¦-Itâ€™s all a bit too perfect: That was one of the things I struggled with. The entire story works itself out pretty perfectly. Knox never gives up, he never surrenders. He has the moment that is the very definition of insta-love the moment he meets Ellie. It was a bit much at first. Even Ellie's shyte-for-brains parents are fable-like villains and truly despicable pieces of dirt. The mistakes that Ellie makes, and some are fairly substantial, are wiped away as if by magic.Donâ€™t get me wrong, I definitely enjoyed myself reading this, but I wouldnâ€™t have minded a bit more conflict, or some doubt, something that made Knox or the story a little less storybook.The Bottom LineI really enjoyed this alot and Iâ€™d definitely recommend for fans of new adult sports romances. Iâ€™m definitely in for the next one.**ARC provided by author for review**See all my reviews at https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7751086","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EY9RPN6W2H97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K7YSHO#wasThisHelpful","R3EY9RPN6W2H97","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: This book had me at hockey romance. Add in that it would be a Russian player and his translator and I was intrigued. While there is alot going on, one of the best parts are Audenâ€™s friendships and the unexpected relationships that turn up during her investigation of her motherâ€™s life, who was killed when she was six. The other highlight was Auden and Aleksandr getting a chance to connect via their memories, hers of her her mother, his parents, all of whom died tragically. It gives them a bond that is believable and I would have loved to delve into their relationship more through those conversations.The Bad: This is first person POV and itâ€™s a bad sign when you struggle to connect with the character whose head youâ€™re in. Auden is almost textbook Mary Sue - stunning, athletic, blond hair/blue eyed virgin (but of course completely oblivious to her charms even though all the guys want her). She's a soccer player, translator, singer, hip hop fitness class instructor, studying for her social work degree while waitressing, and she creates an afterschool program in two cities? All while psychoanalyzing herself and telling the reader exactly why sheâ€™s struggling to fall in love because of her abandonment issues just made her irksome, not relatable. She has moments when I sympathized with her, especially in her scenes with her grandparents. I just wish overall I had liked her more.Everything in Between: I could probably get past that, because I have liked Mary Sue type characters on occasion. As a romance junkie, I need The Big Three Firsts (first meet, kiss and love scene) to knock my socks off. Do that and I can forgive ALOT. Here, the first meet made Aleks seem douchey like he was hooking up with another (no es bueno), the first kiss wasnâ€™t very memorable and the first time had a blink and you miss it vibe to it. Also, itâ€™s a slow burn, which added to my frustration. The scenes where they connect over their families were good but the transition from Aleksandr being douchey to dreamy too quickly didnâ€™t help. Thereâ€™s not alot of heat between them until late in the game and even then, itâ€™s fairly tame, considering how fast Aleksandrâ€™s declaring undying love. When it came to the romance, I wasnâ€™t drawn in.Much like Auden, this book tries to be all things to all people, and while there are scenes I enjoyed, most of it felt extraneous to the romance, which is what brought me in the door, so to speak. While marketed as a hockey romance, itâ€™s not quite that, since the hockey and romance seems almost secondary to the rest of Audenâ€™s life.The Bottom LineIt was ok. There are good moments, but ultimately suffered from a lack of focus on the romance, so it didnâ€™t really work for me.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRQIX3LP2ILV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R1XRQIX3LP2ILV","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-The Good: Travis and Billie have a bit of a rough start, but I liked their connection. There was good sex, but there were proper conversations that showed their chemistry in a non-sexual way. Getting Travisâ€™ backstory and motivations was very appreciated and it made his actions make sense instead of just â€œbecause Iâ€™m a biker, b!tchâ€ and I liked that.-The Bad: Still not feeling the mystery of Priest. Itâ€™s a very tenuous thread thatâ€™s barely been expanded on between two books now. Essentially two bits of info, parsed out very sparingly is a disappointment. Iâ€™m hoping that we learn more in the next book, because it felt as if the first book was all sex, the second book is more sex with better character development, but thatâ€™s it. The final obstacle was predictable and resolved fairly quickly.-Everything in Between: For a biker book, itâ€™s not heavy into the culture, so itâ€™s still more of a 1 on the WTFery scale. Even if Travis and Billieâ€™s relationship works better for me than Ajax and Sophie did, itâ€™s still based on a very condensed timeline with little else to hold it together. That said, I did think that thereâ€™s enough here to make the read enjoyable and I think the little touches, like Billieâ€™s side job as a ghost tour guide, or Travisâ€™ soft spot for Baxter, make this work even with the tight timeline.The Bottom LineI liked it. This is better than the first, and two favorite authors are coming up so Iâ€™m reserving judgment on the overarching storyline til I see what their take is on the Deacons of Bourbon Street series.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RUVKNSQDSTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OX0W#wasThisHelpful","R14RUVKNSQDSTK","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-The Good: I like the setup for the â€˜verse and thereâ€™s alot of things that seemed intriguing, especially the conflict between the Gold Coast vamps and the ones in Vamptown. I liked that all of this is happening in the middle of Chicago, using Chi-town landmarks. The different characters introduced seemed like it would be alot of fun and I always appreciate seeing Latinos as romantic leads. I thought the workaround for the vamps to travel under that big ole ball of heat called the sun was interesting. There were several twists on the traditional vampire mythology that I thought were clever and fun.-The Bad: Alex and Keira didnâ€™t really spark together and Iâ€™d probably have enjoyed it more if Iâ€™d connected with them. They said the right things, but I didnâ€™t feel the chemistry and the sex was a bit more clinical than sexy. Moist being used as a descriptor tends to be offputting, at least to me.-Everything in Between: Things go at a fast clip, and dialogue is rapid fire with few tags to really set the scene. Even with that, it still felt repetitive, especially in the beginning. It felt as if Iâ€™d read about Keira hiding her grandfatherâ€™s journal, and Alex thinks she may be The One over and over as a way to delay giving away the big beats. I get it, but it felt like recapping something I already knew, instead of giving me a better sense of the â€˜verse that I was just joining and really had no clue how everyone interacts.The Bottom LineIt was ok, but it felt like I was missing something, mostly a stronger connection between Alex and Keira. I wouldnâ€™t rule out a return trip to this â€˜verse, but I think Iâ€™d have to start from the beginning.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8YVDAF5VV8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDTR854#wasThisHelpful","R2E8YVDAF5VV8O","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"- The setup is intriguing : How do you get two people who meet under incredibly tense and dangerous circumstances to find a way to survive, nevermind find the time to romance is always intriguing. Alot of romantic suspense is premised on implausible scenarios being the backdrop for romance. Ms. Tyler had an interesting setup, butâ€¦.- The execution...not so much : I think this is best summed up by that quote from Speed with Sandra Bullock and Keanu ReevesJack: I have to warn you, I've heard relationships based on intense experiences never work.Annie: OK. We'll have to base it on sex then.Jack: Whatever you say, ma'am.Cuffs is heavily dependent on the characterâ€™s chemistry and to have their connection work, even if the rest is the height of implausibility. Unfortunately, Alex and Laceyâ€™s romance didnâ€™t work. The transition from fear to sex is jarring and there is barely a conversation before their mysterious chemistry has them making them out. Once it gets to the sex scenes, there was alot of awkward phrasing which wasnâ€™t sexy (oozing and snatches and the like isnâ€™t a turn-on in a story with a cop and an innocent co-ed) and then itâ€™s insta-love. I couldnâ€™t believe that they were even attracted to each other, let alone willing to exchange I Love Yous.I was told about the wonders of Lacey, but all I saw was blunder after blunder that put herself and Alex in danger. Her level of TSTL took me right out of the story and any hope of connecting with the characters. Even Alex has questionable moments. There were times I was tempted to put this down and itâ€™s not a long book. By the end, I did think there was potential with the writing and the suspense part of the story, and had more time been taken to develop the relationship, this could have worked. As it is, itâ€™s too disjointed and implausible for me.The Bottom LineI canâ€™t recommend it because neither the romance or suspense really worked for me. I wish the author well, because there are some moments in here with potential, but the dependency on a TSTL heroine to drive the story and bad sex to cover the rest of it just didnâ€™t work.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1N7D71S6IQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6WVIS8#wasThisHelpful","R2T1N7D71S6IQX","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The final book in the Sisters of the Craft trilogy finds the last sister, Willow Black, residing at the Northern Wisconsin Mental Health Facility. Sheâ€™s struggled all her life, having visions as soon as she sees water. It lead to shrieking, fainting and generally being thought of cuckoo. When she tries to kill a man who was going to try and kill her (she saw it in a vision), she lands in the asylum. When she sees Sebastian Frasier, she recognizes her true love, her soulmate from her lifelong visions. Small problem - heâ€™s the new administrator and her new psychiatrist. Thereâ€™s her sisters to meet, the looming threat of the Venatores Mali, and the big bad, Roland McHugh, to vanquish. In the midst of all that, romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-Enjoyable urban fantasy/paranormal series: Each book focuses on one sister and her finding her true love in the face of overwhelming evil and this is no different. Ms. Handeland has created a great little â€˜verse that Iâ€™ve enjoyed visiting. Thereâ€™s humor and well drawn characters, and the stories (Iâ€™ve read the first and last) flowed well and can stand on their own, though I really need to get around to reading the middle book so the series is complete for me.Good hero and heroine: Willowâ€™s a great heroine. Sheâ€™s pretty pragmatic and level-headed, considering what sheâ€™s suffered in her life. Sheâ€™s never had a stable place to call home, always afraid of the future she could see and no one else would believe. Sebastianâ€™s a good hero whose struggle with the guilt of not being able to save his sister made him sympathetic and a good match for Willow. I would have liked to seen more regarding their romance.Not so much with the sexy: The whole psychiatrist/patient dynamic added a touch of the forbidden to the story that I enjoyed, even if itâ€™s only dealt with in very broad terms. This series is PG though (I think the first book had the most sexy times in it) and the focus is on the magic and vanquishing Roland.Sweet ending: Thereâ€™s some danger, but ultimately, it felt very safe, with a HEA wrapped in a magical bow. Not that thereâ€™s anything wrong with that, but I felt more danger and tension in the first book than I did in the finale.The Bottom LineAn enjoyable read and a nice change of pace from the books Iâ€™d been reading lately. I recommend for fans of paranormal/urban fantasy reads who like a bit of sweet with their witches, Ã  la Charmed.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H41YQHWWYEJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T34962W#wasThisHelpful","R1H41YQHWWYEJ0","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-I like the â€˜verse and the friendships: I picked this up because I saw some promise with the first book, Loving Lo, and I think there continues to be promise with the series. I like the friendships between Cyn, Meg and Troy and the Devilâ€™s Knights also have good chemistry and camaraderie. Some of the highlights of the book are when they discuss their shared love of Sons of Anarchy. I would have liked to have seen a little less screaming at each other, but otherwise thereâ€™s decent banter between them all.-WTFery rating is on the rise, but still mild: Part of what I liked is that theyâ€™re bikers but it was a fairly mild MC series. On a scale of 1-5, last book was about a 1, but thereâ€™s more violence in this book than the previous one, so Iâ€™d rate it a 2. It fits the story being told and thereâ€™s potential for more as the series continues. These guys are trying to keep clean, but arenâ€™t afraid to step it up in defense of their women and those they love, which I admit I enjoy.Rigid and Cyn have their sweet moments: When the time is spent with Rigid and Cyn and they actually speak, I think thereâ€™s a connection between the two. The teasing about Rigidâ€™s real name, Cynâ€™s wish for a doughnut house, those were a bit wacky and had there been some real emotional scenes dealing with her assault, I think there would have been a good balance. Howeverâ€¦.-Not alot of soul searching: What I expected was some time dealing with the fallout from Cynâ€™s assault and there is some, but thereâ€™s not alot of deep soul searching. I struggled with the repetitiveness of the first half of the book and the insistence of Rigid as well as other characters, wanting to â€œfixâ€ Cyn. I would have much rather had them just admit they want to support her, and let her fix herself. In the end, she waffled back and forth for a while, but I wasnâ€™t completely satisfied with the emotional component because there I felt I was told about their feelings, but not so much shown them. More attention was spent describing the food for their cookouts and Rigid packing than their emotional scenes.-Not a standalone: I wouldnâ€™t recommend reading this without reading the first book if only because thereâ€™s little recap of Rigid and Cynâ€™s first meeting or even a glimpse of it from their perspective, instead of what we saw/heard of it from Megâ€™s perspective in the first book. Honestly, it just added to the overall feel of insta-love between them. Sexy times are also mild, but considering she starts the story having just been assaulted, it makes sense.-Continuity/typo errors: What I really struggled with were continuity, grammar and typographical errors. Normally I can gloss over an error or two, because those happen even with the big publishers. But there were quite a few here. For example, a character saying heâ€™s seen the villain three times, then later in the book heâ€™d only seen him once. Cyn has a broken arm but sheâ€™s gripping Rigid on the back of his bike with her broken arm, or carrying a plate of food and four drinks. So many missing little words or the incorrect version of them (such as to instead of too, youâ€™re instead of your, hear instead of here). All these little things that distract and pull you out of the story and I think a good beta reader or editor should have caught that or at least questioned it. It just felt as if it was rushed to print.The Bottom LineIt was ok and thatâ€™s mostly due to likability of the characters. I really wanted to enjoy it, but there were a few too many missed opportunities - not enough emotional buildup, too much repetitive dialogue and too many continuity/typos that took me out of the story too many times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK33IC3OU8BA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOLS5HU#wasThisHelpful","RK33IC3OU8BA9","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Original review at http://afterdarkbooklovers.com/2015/07/30/book-review-servicing-the-target-by-cherise-sinclair/The Good, the Even Better and Everything In BetweenThis is one of my favorite Shadowlands ever. Ben and Anne had a great, balanced power exchange - Ben's not too submissive and Anne wasn't too rigid in her need to top. They really worked as a cohesive unit. The conflict was genuine, the sex was steamy and the love was sweet. Add to that the glimpses of the earlier couples and the continuing friendships, and I was in heaven.The Bottom LineI absolutely loved it and I highly recommend it for fans of Cherise Sinclair, and for BDSM romance junkies. Check it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEQR35YHE6C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT206F6#wasThisHelpful","R2MEQR35YHE6C7","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alyssa Barrow, met her husband Rob at nineteen, and they lived happily ever afterâ€”until he died. He knew he was dying of cancer, and he urged his young wife to go on and find love again, and wrote up some sexy cards to encourage her opening up her body and soul to someone else, when the time was right. Two years later, that time has come - the moment Harrison Kemp moves in next door. Harrisonâ€™s not into a relationship and Alyssa just wants to feel again, but you canâ€™t stop romance when it happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenLoved the premise: Something about second loves fascinate me from a romantic perspective. The process of moving on and finding love again is a trope that I think plays beautifully in most romance novels. Knowing that Alyssa lost her husband two years ago helped with believing that she was open to the possibility of falling in love again, although her love for Rob felt more in keeping with great friendship than passionate love. The cards and how they inspired Alyssa and Harrisonâ€™s relationship was great. The setting in Toronto was fun and Alyssaâ€™s condo association meetings, and the little scenes with her neighbors, were funny and gave a good backdrop for this romance.Good sexual chemistry: Harrison and Alyssaâ€™s sexual relationship was certainly strong enough that I believed in the lust that they had for each other. Their love scenes were plentiful and I am so going to try out that grapefruit scene. I think as The cards left by Rob, Alyssaâ€™s husband, really drove Alyssa to re-explore her sexuality, which brings me to this point - the book played more like erotic chick lit - it was all about Alyssa and her feelings and desires, but unlike most chick lit books, thereâ€™s plenty of sex.Narrow first person POV: What held me back from really loving the book was the feeling of isolation, only seeing things from Alyssaâ€™s fairly narrow viewpoint. Her reactions to Harrison usually came off as too over the top to me, and honestly, we barely get to know him except for how dirty he loves to talk (not a bad thing, but still). I really wanted to understand how they were transitioning to love from amazing sex. Sex is great, but that doesnâ€™t mean real love automatically follows. All of their intense scenes played out strictly from her POV. Even towards the end, when Alyssa is declaring her love for Harrison, when the reveal of who has been calling him on the phone and what happened that drove Harrison to not want a relationship, felt rushed and cursory. Itâ€™s all about Alyssa, which made the romance pretty one-sided.The Bottom LineI liked it and read it quickly enough, though I wished more time had been spent on Harrisonâ€™s character to really elevate the romance. There is a second book, 30 Nights, which will feature another hero/heroine, and I would be open to checking it out.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LH6SJTT2GUKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53E0H6#wasThisHelpful","R1LH6SJTT2GUKN","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bennett and Linc, the best man and woman at their friendsâ€™ wedding, hook up for a ONS. Ten weeks later, a pregnant Bennett realizes that sheâ€™s in for way more than she bargained for...and along the way, romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-Excellent cover: Because that torso...yum. I requested it based on the torso, and that itâ€™s a shifter romance. Then I realized that I had read the earlier book in the series, Take it Like a Vamp. That was a cute book and this is right in line with it.-Standalone: The story picks up at the end of the last one and Nick and Casey feature as secondary characters. It might be better to have read Take it Like a Vamp first. That said, thereâ€™s enough details here that you could pick up on the basics of this â€˜verse without feeling lost.-Funny and cute: Linc and Bennett have good chemistry and thereâ€™s not alot of angst, considering they never planned on continuing their relationship, even if theyâ€™re crazy attracted to each other. I give them both points for stepping up and dealing with it in an adult way and even when Bennett picks on Linc - alot of it is blamed on hormones, mostly itâ€™s just the way she is - I think they work together. I would have liked more about them, as opposed to all the madness of the pregnancy and secrets revealed about the past.-Some danger: Thereâ€™s some discussion of the danger that Bennett and her baby is in, and Linc is second in command to Nick, so theyâ€™re all about protection. I just think that thereâ€™s alot of build up for the danger that theyâ€™re in, and then not much happens on that front before the story wraps and theyâ€™re into their HEA. Itâ€™s light and breezy,  Itâ€™s light and breezy read though, so I wasn't necessarily surprised, I just wished it would have cashed in on the possible danger. I do think thereâ€™s potential for another book (I see you Mason...and Iâ€™d like to see more), so Iâ€™d like to see them living their HEA and whatâ€™s going on with the baby and its interesting supernatural heritage.The Bottom Line [3 ½ stars]I liked it as a easy read with funny characters and a healthy dose of paranormal happenings to spice things up. If youâ€™ve read and enjoyed Take it Like a Vamp, or a fan of light shifter romances, youâ€™ll probably enjoy this as well.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ROPQLUPB175/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3GBHHI#wasThisHelpful","R18ROPQLUPB175","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Woolf Jennings is a man with secrets. The biggest of which is his club, The Wicked Horse, and what kinky goings-on happen in the Silo. He loves his hedonistic lifestyle, until Callie Hayes comes back to Wyoming and shows him what heâ€™s really been missing, You know...romance.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-I love Bridger: Now this is rare that I start a review with this much love for a supporting player, but really? Bridger has the potential to be the shiznit. I have warned my fellow shorties that I have dibs on him. Heâ€™s the alpha, he has the dark and mysterious past, smoking sexuality, no problem with commanding a room and yeah, I want him. Like, right now would be great Ms. Bennett. Thank you.-Good chemistry between Woolf and Callie: Ok, onto the main event - when it comes to the featured players, Woolf and Callie, I thought they were a good bridge between your usual Sawyer Bennett hero/heroine, into a slightly kinkier iteration in this series, which is more sexcentric than any of the previous books Iâ€™ve read by her.  Woolfâ€™s always been attracted to Callie, but he felt he didnâ€™t deserve the good girl. Callie just wanted him since the moment she realized boys were different. Thereâ€™s a sweetness to their attraction and I loved seeing Woolf get possessive (even with some of the events later in the book) and Callie break out of her shell. I would have liked some more dialogue between Callie and Woolf, to really showcase an emotional connection. Thereâ€™s a hint of it when they go camping where you really feel their underlying friendship, but I just wanted more talking. But the sex did distract me, because itâ€™s titillating.-Kinky effery: Their sex scenes have a good amount of heat and theyâ€™re more daring sexually than traditional romances, especially with introducing another player into their personal mix. Like say, Bridger. Yum. Now, as long as dirty talkingâ€™s your main thing, thatâ€™s cool because thereâ€™s no real BDSM scenes. Thereâ€™s multiple partner sex and some anal play, but beyond that the rest is only implied. This book was more about Woolf stopping his kinky ways than any real exploration into the lifestyle. Thereâ€™s alot of talk in the beginning about what goes on in the Silo, but I feel that the kinky effery is only window dressing here.-Woolfâ€™s more of a beta: Woolf is hot with Callie, and their chemistry is strong, there is no doubt. But Bridger is the alpha man who captured my interest. Woolf deferred to Bridger for his kinks, and Bridgerâ€™s the reason heâ€™s even into the Silo. Bridgerâ€™s the one who guides Woolf through alot of this story and just felt like the man in charge. While I enjoyed this book, the one I really want is Bridger.-Callie wants to walk on the wild side: Callie meets Woolf after years apart when he catches her about to enter a wet t-shirt contest at the Wicked Horse. Callieâ€™s pretty clear about her feelings for Woolf and is willing to dip her toes into the kinky waters, but sheâ€™s really not built for that lifestyle. Especially considering her family connections. My only quibble with her is how she tends to back down and fall into â€œgood girlâ€ mode a little too easily. Sheâ€™s more passive than I would ave liked and she defers to daddy when the inevitable final obstacle happens. That didnâ€™t work for me that well, even if it fit her character.-Series potential: With the introduction of Bridger and the other employees at the Wicked Horse, there is good potential for future books. Basically, I felt thereâ€™s a good tease that makes you want more. Did I mention that I think Bridgerâ€™s book is going to be the one that really hooks me? Because, yeah Iâ€™d like that one now.The Bottom Line [3 Â½ stars]Woolf and Callie have their own sweet heat, and for a foray into BDSM for Ms. Bennett, I think it's a good start to a new series. I liked it, but I have a feeling itâ€™s the future entries in the series that will really be my faves. Yes, Iâ€™m still looking at you Bridger.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127XZCFU9EQO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGD337Y#wasThisHelpful","R127XZCFU9EQO6","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kai Monahan, human, is drawn into the dragonâ€™s world through circumstances beyond her control. When sheâ€™s accidentally heartsworn to Rhys, the dragon king (it only takes a touch), they have to figure out if they can go through with completing the bond while dodging the big bad dragonâ€™s thatâ€™s trying to kill Rhys and eventually, the human race. You know, that old chestnut.The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenMore urban fantasy/paranormal than romance: The writing is good and the world building is done well. There is alot to process though, so the first half of the book lagged a bit while I adjusted to all the bits of info being thrown at me. That said, I read this pretty quickly because the overarching storyline of the big bad whoâ€™s trying to usurp the dragon throne kept me intrigued.I think this works much more as an urban fantasy than the romance, but itâ€™s the first book in a trilogy, so I can only hope that the romance gets stronger as it goes along. Regardless, I am interested in many of the secondary characters (#teamCadoc!), so they are whatâ€™s keeping me coming back for more.About that romanceâ€¦.: In an interesting â€˜verse, it was the weakest part of it. I really wish tat more time and attention had been spent in really making the reader feel some chemistry between Kai and Rhys. For the first third of the book, they barely interact, and quite frankly, I thought Kai had more chemistry with Cadoc (who breaks my heart and needs a HEA stat). Rhys waffled alot, clearly didnâ€™t want a mate, but even when heâ€™s heartsworn, it felt more like an obligation than any kind of real feelings for Kai.Kai could be frustrating as a heroine, and as immature as youâ€™d expect a 20 year old to be, thrust into a very strange world where no one wants to explain anything to her. I was hard pressed to hold it against her completely, because the dragons were lacking in any kind of empathy for her and how strange this all was. Deryn, Rhysâ€™ sister, in particular, irked me alot. She was saved by Kai, more than once, and barely acknowledged it - she just came off as a jerk. I thought Ashem and Juli had the best chemistry of them all, and theyâ€™re a small part of the overall story.The Bottom LineI liked it, but more as an urban fantasy more than a romance. I would recommend for fans of UF who don't need a strong romantic angle. Iâ€™d be interested in the next book.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8CY81RL5FV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD1DQWC#wasThisHelpful","R3B8CY81RL5FV3","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sandra has just moved back from New York, to escape an abusive Dom. She still needs her D/s fix, so she goes to Club Desire, where she meets Brent. Brent knows Sandra from high school, where he carried a torch for her, but she doesnâ€™t recognize him. Can Brent protect Sandra while introducing her to BDSM kinky effery? Well, you know romance is gonna happen.The Good, The Bad and Everything in BetweenNew to me author: Iâ€™ve never read anything by this author, but I did like the set up to this club. I thought Club Desire reminded me of a little of other BDSM clubs in Romancelandia, where the Doms are tasty and itâ€™s all about the safe, sane and consensual, which I can get down with. Thereâ€™s a wealth of potential for other Doms to find their own HEAs, and Iâ€™d definitely like to check out Dexâ€™s story.BDSM 101: If there was one thing that took me out of the love story, it was the overly instructional nature of the BDSM scenes. I appreciate the need to emphasize the SSC motto but I felt that some of the spontaneity and chemistry between the characters was sacrificed for it. Brent would explain what he was about to do to Sandra, and then Sandra would describe the exact same thing. It made it feel repetitive instead of sexy. Now, Iâ€™ve certainly read my fair share of BDSM tales, so this may not bother someone who is less familiar with the genre.Insta-love: Brent and Sandra have that instant attraction and you could say itâ€™s insta-love, especially on Sandraâ€™s part. I mean, at 4% sheâ€™s already thinking that he could be the man that could dominate and care for her. It felt kind of quick. There is a bit of good chemistry at first, and thereâ€™s definite heat between them. When the â€œsecretâ€ that Brent knew Sandra in high school comes out, it plays out pretty much exactly as you expect it to.Crazy villain danger: Thereâ€™s the psycho ex Dom, who has some pages devoted to his crazy stalking. Even if heâ€™s completely irredeemable, it does add tension to the story.The Bottom LineI liked elements of this and I think thereâ€™s potential for the series.

"Review originally posted at (...)Edie and Magnus have been enlisted to be part of the wedding party for their friendsâ€™ bridezilla wedding and sparks fly when they meet. Mostly of the angry hate kind. Sheâ€™s a cat lady, heâ€™s a gamer and ...well, itâ€™s a twist on Taming of the Shrew, and of course sweet, sweet romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-Iâ€™m a sucker for Shakespeare inspired tales: So Taming of the Shrew is a weakness of mine, so when I saw the blurb for this book, I was into the idea from the very beginning. Thereâ€™s good banter throughout between all the characters, and I loved Edieâ€™s friendship with Gretchen. Theyâ€™re both abrasive in their own ways, but they absolutely click together and made it easy for me to connect with Edie.-Edieâ€™s has claws, but I loved her: Edieâ€™s had a hard go of it and after a horrible accident years ago, she has a limp to show for it. What I loved though is that the accident didnâ€™t make her a raging bitch. Sheâ€™s always been a raging bitch.She does not suffer fools gladly and she says what she feels. But sheâ€™s not a one note character - too many times, the focus on a heroineâ€™s hard edges for too long can make you not care once her soft underbelly shows through. In this case, Edieâ€™s shines from the beginning, through her love of cats. I loved that she cares for those that are thrown away, and well, letâ€™s just say I understood her love of cats, having at one point in my life owned four of them.  The accident did take her self-confidence and her ex took her trust, but sheâ€™s got a good core that makes her relatable, at least to me.-Magnus is a great match for her: He starts a bit dick-ish, and his intro to Edie was anything but love at first sight. As he explains to her later though,""Let me share something with you, my little cat lady. Guys that get together? Talk s*** about three things: sports, games, and chicks. None of it should be taken as gospel."" He thought for a moment, then added, ""Except the sports."" After another moment, he added, ""And maybe the gaming. But not the s*** about the chicks. That""s just guys talking crap to other guys.""I think itâ€™s his story arc thatâ€™s my fave. He really gets Edie. Heâ€™s intrigued with her from the start, even if sheâ€™s prickly.  Their chemistry was good and the sex was fun with just enough raunch.-Their siblings? I have no love for them: They suck. No doubt. They are all about themselves  and when the big reveal happens I was happy that they both got what was coming to them.-Great, great grovel at the end: First of all, I have to commend the fact that Magnus mans up and does what needs doing when it counts. And when he has to prove his love for Edie? Iâ€™ll admit, I was completely touched by the gesture. It got to the heart of the story and really tied it all together. It gave me the happy fuzzy feels that I want in my romance and made me believe in their HEA.The Bottom LineThis is my favorite billionaire romance by Ms. Clare so far - I really connected with Edie, and Magnus really came through in the end. Iâ€™d definitely recommend for those who love a little prickly banter (and lots of cats) in their romances.**ARC provided by author for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REUYZVCZVBIT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV1294O#wasThisHelpful","REUYZVCZVBIT2","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Renner Blackfoot is tired of going from random hookup to random hookup, and when he sees the new masseuse at the clanâ€™s lodge, he has to meet her. Except heâ€™s already met her - he doesnâ€™t realize itâ€™s his Bethy, the girl he treated like poo when they were kids because, well heâ€™s a boy. Itâ€™s complicated, but romance does happen.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-Freebie: sometimes you have to wade through alot of rocks to get a gem, but this is one.-Who doesnâ€™t like a shifter Christmas in July?: Well, a little bit of Christmas, but it wasnâ€™t so overwhelming that you felt like youâ€™re spitting up tinsel, so I liked it.-Novella length: Read it in a couple of hours, and it was worth the time. Surprisingly well done â€˜verse with good character development and intriguing shifter rules that arenâ€™t the norm.-Good chemistry between leads: Renner was going through alot when he was a kid and took it out on Bethy, and she wanted to comfort him. But when it comes down to it, Renner really did care about her and the little things that proved to her that he cared was just sweet. Thereâ€™s talk about his past hookups, but itâ€™s all off page, and he is definitely all about Bethany.-Not sure about the logic in not mating: Itâ€™s different, but Iâ€™m not sure how I feel about this being the big obstacle, besides Bethy and Rennerâ€™s history. That said, Iâ€™d read more books set in this â€˜verse, for sure.The Bottom LineI liked it and I bought the Ozark Mountain shifter bundle based on this book, so I'd say this freebie did its job.

"The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenThis will be quick - while the first book wasnâ€™t perfect, this entry pretty much exemplifies why I think serials or multi-book romances are a) not my favorite; and b) not easy to pull off. I struggled to keep reading it, putting it down several times to complete other books because I couldnâ€™t keep my focus on the story.There were alot of declarations of love and plenty of sex, but no real excitement. All the tension in their romance was in the first installment, while this entry felt inundated with alot of sweet feels with no kick. I truly believe there is a good story here that would have been so much better with some good editing.The Bottom LineIt was an ok read that suffered from a lack of storyline.

"Cole and Christy are living their HEA, and dealing with small road bumps along the way relating to their relationships with their mothers.The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenCole is one of my favoritest dirty talkers ever: Oh Cole. The man has a way with the dirty words that makes me fluttery. Heâ€™s just as gruff, cranky yet loving and completely devoted to Christy as I remember.Christy doesnâ€™t backslide: Sheâ€™s struggled with her weight, and this novella just reinforces the strength of will that Christy has. Her mother Martha is as horrible as ever, but itâ€™s great to see Christy handle her business.A love note for nerds: Part of Christyâ€™s appeal for me is her inner/outer nerd. Itâ€™s on full display here and the finaleâ€™s a fun postscript to their love story.Novella length:  very quick and satisfying read for fans of Heavy Issues. Which meansâ€¦Not a standalone: It really is a continuation of their story and you need to have at least a cursory knowledge of their romance.

"Carissa has a flat tire. Sheâ€™s on the side of the road, holding her baby boy, wondering what sheâ€™ll do, when a big bad biker named Joker rolls up to help her. Carissa knows Joker, but in another life. Will they reconnect and find love? *blinks* yeah, itâ€™s Kristen Ashley, so of course romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-MC romance Kristen Ashley Style: Kristen Ashley has been a favorite author of mine for a while now, anyone whoâ€™s seen my reviews may have noticed the overabundance of them on KAâ€™s books. Some books Iâ€™ve definitely connected with more than others, but the one that started it all was Motorcycle Man. It was my introduction to biker romances, and letâ€™s face it - you never forget your first.Since then, Iâ€™ve read milder MC romances and many that were way, way, way darker, so dark they make Chaos look like Candyland.  On the WTFery scale, Chaos MC is 1-2 and thatâ€™s just fine with me. They make you feel dangerous but also safe. At heart, about family first (whereas other MC romances are brothers first). These are bikers who love their women and hand out love advice to their brothers, and when they get their HEAs, itâ€™s uplifting and happy, gushy feels. Now, while Tack Allen will always hold a special place in my fluttery bits and he is the prez of my stable of book-boyfriends, Joker has moved right up there as my second favorite of this series.-Joker and Carissa had me at hello: There is so much to love about them, but the tone is set from page one. When you see their past, his abuse, and their interactions in high school I was completely on board with them getting together. He doesnâ€™t suffer any major douche-canoe moments, she doesnâ€™t get completely ditzy. Yes, heâ€™s a strong, silent type, and sheâ€™s sweet, kind, stubborn, sassy and funny. They are what you expect from a KA couple and they do not disappoint.-Oh the cameos:  There is enough backstory given so that new readers can still enjoy themselves, but these cameos are little happy presents for the longtime reader. I swear I had a smile on my face reading this book and none so big as when Iâ€™d read the names of fave characters from previous books making minor appearances. Getting those tiny glimpse of their continuing HEAs gave me the fuzzy feels. You get glimpses of heroes from Rock Chicks, Dream Men and Knight (yeah, Daddy). Those little moments just enhance that hometown vibe.Thereâ€™s little clothes/HGTV porn: While I love the tone KA can set with her descriptions, there are times when the text can get heavy with architecture/decorating bits and less on the characters and those books arenâ€™t my fave. Iâ€™m happy to say that is so not the case here. This is big on the feels, not so much on the furniture and itâ€™s great.So, the F word: Yes, formula, what did you think I meant? *blinks* Yes, KA has one and thatâ€™s not a bad thing. When she is on point? Those are some of my favorite books ever. The elements you expect are here. The story and setting is familiar, but when the characters come alive, as Joker and Carissa do, I can and will forgive the little things. So, while, yes, I do believe there are times when the story tips over to predictable and yes, the â€œdangerousâ€ parts are wrapped up fairly quickly and for the most part, off-page. You know what? I donâ€™t care. Yes, I would have liked some more tension in the story beyond Carrieâ€™s baby-daddy drama, but I enjoyed the story as it was presented to me.Theyâ€™re all coming together: And in the good way. I do think that the â€œdangerousâ€ part is building for what seems to be an overarching storyline involving the Dream Man heroes and Knightâ€™s Unfinished Heroes series.  Thatâ€™s fine because, I think any darker elements may work better in a romance featuring some of the brothers who arenâ€™t getting into relationships with a single mother.The Bottom LineThis was a very enjoyable read for me. While thereâ€™s no big danger, there are big, happy fuzzy feels that a Kristen Ashley fan will enjoy. I definitely recommend this.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWM2YCMT2UYWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5A6HWC#wasThisHelpful","RWM2YCMT2UYWJ","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Anderson, stuffed shirt businessman who wants everything in order in his life, meets Mia Argaropolis, artist and basically anything but orderly. Sparks fly, disaster strikes often, and in the midst of all that, romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-Had the feel of a screwball comedy, at first: Then things settled into a humorous, not too wacky read. Their first meet was probably the most screwball yet fun, and there are some very adorable moments with the Queen Bs and Clancy, the dog. The humor never went too crazy and was paced fairly well.-Michael and Mia have decent chemistry...: The big three (first meet, first kiss, first love scene) were a mixed bag for me. The first meet and kiss were very good, the first love scene took quite a while to get to and was a bit of a disappointment. Their feelings changed like lightning, instead of feeling gradual and organic to the story. It could change in the space of a paragraph and I wanted to side more with Mia, but the miscommunications...oy vey.-The dreaded Big Mis: Those miscommunications were pretty much all at Miaâ€™s feet and I wish it had been a bit more even in terms of screwups. The big ones, which lead to their separation, were all Mia jumping to conclusions, which wasnâ€™t as satisfying for me.The Bottom LineIt was cute, though the miscommunications felt a bit forced and didnâ€™t quite work for me. It was an enjoyable enough afternoon read that I would give this series another shot.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GTPYJP8PHPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z637D2Y#wasThisHelpful","R9GTPYJP8PHPD","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Angie is hired by Charles to clean out his fatherâ€™s townhouse, but warned never to talk to his father, Grayson. Angie shows up at the dusty hoarder house and is intrigued, curious about the poor old man living in the ruins of this home. Until she realizes heâ€™s not that old and also, super hot. Then, romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenThe Good: It almost had a Beauty and the Beast vibe, since the hero hides away on the second floor of the house. I enjoyed the intrigue in getting to know Grayson, bit by bit. The build to his reveal did pull me in and I really wanted to love this love story, because the premise is solid. The idea of the hero being schizophrenic and having to live with that mental illness, as well as the glimpses of his struggle, are by far the strongest parts of this story.The Not So Good: However, the entire story is told from Angieâ€™s POV and sheâ€™s contradictory in her attitudes and actions, and at times, really hard for me to connect with. Sheâ€™s horrified at the way she invades Graysonâ€™s privacy one moment, then offended that he wants to keep his privacy. Moments that are supposed to be charming and cute, really didnâ€™t resonate with me.I appreciated that she had a full life, however, the narrative sometimes gets bogged down in the minutiae of her day. Also, her attitudes towards other characters can be fairly judgy, which is a bit of a turnoff and thereâ€™s certain things that she blames herself for that are disturbing to me as a woman.Finally, the villain of the piece has no depth. Heâ€™s just a greedy little bastard and thereâ€™s no explanation as to why or how he got to be that way. I would have loved to understand what possibly went wrong, or even have a modicum of understanding of Graysonâ€™s life before Angie, and there simply isnâ€™t offered to the reader. The potential was there for some really good emotional, confrontational scenes, but the climax fell flat.The Bottom LineIt was ok. There were good moments, but overall itâ€™s a good premise that just didnâ€™t come together in the execution for me.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3A8Z9T15GVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5F64I#wasThisHelpful","R3J3A8Z9T15GVN","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the third book in the Beneath series, Elle walks into Chains, Lordâ€™s pawn shop, just as heâ€™s firing a thieving employee. Lord knows he shouldnâ€™t go for Elle since sheâ€™s his brotherâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s BFF. Elleâ€™s looking for something very important to her and she needs to work at Chains to do it. Will romance happen? Of course.The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between-Third in series but stands alone: I havenâ€™t read the earlier books, but after reading this entry, I am curious about them and I am certainly interested in the next. Curious, but not feeling as if I couldnâ€™t keep up with whatâ€™s going on in this installment, so points for that.-Good sexy times: Lord and Elle have good chemistry, insta-love that doesnâ€™t feel too forced and hot love scenes. Lord, he has plenty of chances to flex his alpha muscles, without ever feeling too OTT. Speaking of yummy Lord...-Lordâ€™s a good alpha: Protective and caring, yet respectful to Elle, he never looks elsewhere and heâ€™s a good dirty talker. Basically he ticked alot of boxes for me. Itâ€™s a very safe read, so no nonsense with other women to muck things up.-Elle has her issues but sheâ€™s likeable: Sheâ€™s a little overwrought in her concerns but she doesnâ€™t have any major TSTL moments, and since the story is told in alternating first person POV, you get a good amount of time her head as well as Lordâ€™s. Time that explains why Elleâ€™s so concerned about ending up like her mother. This leads me to...-Sometimes repetitive: While I enjoyed the story, there are several moments where the need to repeat their motivations, such as Elle saying she wonâ€™t get into a relationship...until she does. Or Lord being careful because of who Elle is. That kind of thing was repeated often and sometimes felt obvious in a way that didnâ€™t add to the story that much.-That climax: The ultimate villain was a bit of a surprise, if only because I could have pictured future story with that character. Though sad, Iâ€™m glad it wasnâ€™t something that came straight out of the blue but made sense and I liked that.The Bottom LineA simple yet enjoyable read, Iâ€™d recommend it for those who donâ€™t mind younger H/h and like a hot yet sweet Alpha hero.

"When the story begins, Alexandra, a Seattle cop, is on the hunt for Apollo, a drug that can make you feel like a god, at least until your internal organs incinerate. She meets Kell, a huge biker who is, of course, more than he seems on the outside. And then romance happens.The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenIntriguing setup: Besides this obviously established â€˜verse of vampires, witches and shifters (oh my), the explanation for â€œwitchcraftâ€ was a novel one and certainly got my attention. The overarching storyline of a drug called Apollo is a good one and makes me want to continue with the series, just to see what happens with characters like Bear and Daire.Good chem between Kell and Lex: Their first meeting, first kiss and first love scene all had the right amount of heat and it was easy enough to invest in their connection.For a smart heroine, sheâ€™s a bit dim sometimes: not all the time, but Lex is portrayed as a smart capable heroine.  I would have believed it full stop if she didnâ€™t insist on referring to her girly bits and waffling about her feelings for the hero. It didnâ€™t quite work for me.Bikers in name only: while there are a couple of biker gangs mentioned, itâ€™s really in name only. On an MC romance WTFery scale, it only rates about a 1.A bit purple prose-y: The softening of said girly bits and uncoiling of heat, phrases that tipped the love scenes over the line into the land of purple prose took me out of the moment. I enjoyed their setup, but once the lovemaking kicked in, I found myself wanting to skim the love scenes.Playing catch up with earlier series: I was able to read this and follow along, so this book can standalone. That said, Iâ€™ll admit to seeing alot of characters that clearly had a history and scenes that must have happened off page in that earlier series made me want to read those books, just to find out what I was missing.The Bottom LineI liked it, despite wishing I had read the earlier companion series.

"The Good, The Bad and Everything In BetweenThe Good: The writing has hints of humor, quirky characters, and I liked Nox, Garrettâ€™s son alot. Seeing the hierarchy of the pack and other shifters in the town was set up well and I actually enjoyed the chemistry between the supporting characters and the world they helped to bring to life.  The question about the Averdeen womenâ€™s powers, the history of the pack, possible human hunters...thereâ€™s alot of potential in this â€˜verse and I would be willing to read the next entry.Everything in Between: The story has its twists and turns, and I will admit it was a ride I wasnâ€™t anticipating, not sure I enjoyed all facets of, but I did read it all and I think that has to do the Ms. Eamesâ€™ writing and the potential I see here. I appreciate that sheâ€™s gone against the grain when it comes to a shifter romance. Iâ€™m just not sure if sheâ€™s ultimately successful in executing this.The Bad: I have to delve into the weakest part of this romance...and thatâ€™s the romance. Lennox and Garrettâ€™s relationship is messy, hurtful, at times sexy and filled with bittersweet moments. Alright, messy is fine and not the usual in shifter romances, where insta-love and fated mates are the order of the day. I thought that this could make it a really interesting read. If youâ€™re going to tell a story about love the second time around, it can be done in a way that allows the reader to accept that and understand why the hero/heroine is letting go of the past, and embracing love. I could have gotten behind that. However, thatâ€™s not what happens here.SPOILERY BIT ALERT - FOR THOSE WHO DONâ€™T MIND SPOILERS PROCEED. OTHERWISE, LOOK TO THE BOTTOM LINE.When the story began, I felt as if Garrett was supposed to finally realize that you can love more than once. The human heart is capable of healing and loving again. Thatâ€™s a beautiful sentiment. Unfortunately, over and over, Garrett was quite clear about choosing his wife OVER Lennox. At one point, he even acknowledges that he knew Lennox loved him and that her love had been one-sided. Yet, at the end, he he tells her sheâ€™s his soul mate? No. Just. No. That itâ€™s all wiped clean in the epilogue doesnâ€™t fix that for me.END OF SPOILERY BITThat ending: At the eleventh hour, I felt as if the story then went against all it had built up until that moment and tried to have it both ways, just to have a HEA. It felt like it was meant to clean things up and wrap it all up in a neat bow, when the package itself was wrapped haphazardly with bits and bobs sticking out all over the place.The Bottom LineThereâ€™s enough potential with the â€˜verse Ms. Eames created that I enjoyed parts of this, even if I didnâ€™t connect with the romance between Lennox and Garrett.**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34K0LMB6DX8I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOL3VA6#wasThisHelpful","R34K0LMB6DX8I2","A1LGEZKBNXPUW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGEZKBNXPUW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried a number of different Gloveworks gloves and found them to be very strong. I could not pull hard enough to rip them. I would like to address the size selection of the Gloveworks gloves. I generally wear extra large golf, hunting, and work gloves. I found that if I am doing fine work such as cleaning and putting back together something like a carburetor, the medium sized gloves were big enough to stretch very tightly so that I could have them on and hardly notice they are there. I can pick up and handle very small items just as I would with bare fingers. Generally the Gloveworks large size would be plenty big enough for me and work for most things.My wife has fairly large hands and always wears disposable gloves for gardening and weeding. She would usually wear a men's large, but the medium in the Gloveworks fit perfectly.I have found the Gloveworks gloves excellent for many types of work and resistant to most cleaners and solvents that I use.

"The Complete Wild Game Cookbook is in fact really complete. It covers recipes for almost anything you might hunt in North America, from Plover to Muskox. The book includes hunting with respect for the animal, nutrition of the various game, how meat is cooked and tenderized. It also includes great photos of all of the game animals for which there are recipes, by chapter.There are individual recipes for each animal and very nice pictures of many of the prepared dishes. I will surely never eat a Lark, but I'm sure the the recipe could be adapted to another more common game bird. Even without having cooked a thing, I found the book very interesting and informative. There are many recipes which I would consider gourmet meals.We have many favorite meals especially for geese, pheasants and deer and I look forward through the coming months of trying some new recipes.

"The Epson WorkForce Pro WF-R4640 EcoTank Wireless Printer is an excellent product. When I ordered this unit, I had not paid attention to its size since this was a product sent to me for review. This is not your every day ""sit on the desk"" printer. It is meant for much more. It is large, heavy, very fast and has many options. The working screen is a very sensitive touch screen and the wireless connection is reliable and fast. The prints are great.I have set up other wireless printers and most have been difficult at best, this was a breeze. The only problem was that the disk, that was provided for set-up, did not work with Windows 10. I went to the Epson website, picked the WF-R4640 model from a list and downloaded the program. Little more than a simple click and it set itself up, and worked perfectly. This unit can be set up with a wired or wireless system and even the wireless can be set up using a temporary wire connection.This printer will scan, fax, and print. It has built in wireless and Wi-Fi direct and it will print from your iPad or iPhone and also from your Android.I like the way the buttons work and the sensible way a user gets from one function to another. This is a user friendly printer.I would primarily recommend this printer/faz/ scanner to small businesses such as real estate offices, school libraries, insurance offices, small town city halls and courts, and any business or individual who needs fast and quality prints for a low price.

"I really enjoyed Saturn Run by John Sandford and Ctein. I used to read a lot of SciFi, but I lost interest after about a half dozen or so very dark or very poorly written books. It was nice to read one that has characters without a whole bunch of silly names containing multiple connected vowels or weird consonant combinations.Saturn Run has believable, solid characters that I have found interesting. The story flows and though it takes place about 50 or so years in the future it seems connected with today in a way that the reader can relate to easily. After all the ship is named the Richard M. Nixon.The story line is about an alien ship that was sighted by accident coming into and leaving the Saturn/moons system. It became a race between the U. S. and China to get to Saturn to check it out and hopefully be the first to get the advanced technology which the aliens obviously possessed. The story began in the head of a handyman who was working on a U.S. space station. I liked that a lot.I recommend this book for those who like some technology explanations, thoughtful plot and setting planning, some mystery, solid and interesting characters, and a competition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LPXF414TCU7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176950#wasThisHelpful","R1LPXF414TCU7H","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seldom used anything but Norelco shavers and I really like them. I have used, for about 8 months, the Norelco S7370, which is very similar to the one that I am now reviewing, the S8950. I really cannot tell any difference other than the new one has sharper blades. They both give me the closest shave that I get without using a blade.The two shavers are about the same price and sized units. The replacement heads are about $15. cheaper for the new one (S8950). The older model, the S7370 has a trimming head that can be used for trimming sideburns,  but little else. The new one has a beard trimming head which can be use for giving yourself that 2-3 days growth beard look, that seems very popular now. Both must have the shaving head popped off and then replaced with the trimming head. They just pull off, not twist.The whole unit works very well, but a caution, you must have enough space to leave these units on the counter and they are not tiny. If you move them and tilt the unit, the cleaning liquid will spill out of the base. Even with those things in mind, this is still my favorite shaver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R228FENMEP2C7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","R228FENMEP2C7R","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As anyone knows who has welded without an auto-darkening shield,  it is always difficult to place the rod where it needs to be on the metal being welded since it cannot be seen with the old helmets in place.The Jackson takes care of this problem. Since I had never used one of these helmets before, I adjusted the settings for auto-darkening sensitivity and level of light protection. There is a scale to be found in the direction booklet. I fit the helmet adjustments for my comfort and read about cleaning and protection of the helmet while not in use. I then went to a bright incandescent light bulb with the helmet on and flashed on the light bulb several times. The shield darkened immediately. I experimented with changing the light sensitivity of the helmet to see how this would affect the darkening and ability to see the bulb. In this way I learned how the helmet functioned without committing myself to the arc light. I became satisfied that the helmet did just what it should do and did it well. Then I went to the welder and experimented with using the helmet the way it was designed. I did some welding.It was a pleasure to see the metal pieces to be welded before arcing began. The change from normal sight to arc light protection and back happened fast without any unwanted flash of light ( I was skeptical ). My old helmets will likely end up in the garbage. The Jackson is comfortable, easy to adjust and affords good protection.I like everything about the helmet, and its 5 year warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAL2MU2MBLGIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFJLRD4#wasThisHelpful","RAL2MU2MBLGIA","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I ordered the Contigo Autosprout Ashland Water Bottle, I didn't realize that I have had an older model of this bottle for about 2 years. My wife needed one so hence the order.I really like the way this bottle works and its durability. The new one is just slightly different mechanically than the old one and that one has worked great. I especially like to use this bottle while driving because I use the straw inside the unit and I only need one hand to get a drink. I don't have to lean my head back to drink. It's not necessary to remove the top or open it. Just push the button.  If I want to use the container without the straw it just unscrews. Also... it fits into the container holes on the golf cart.If the bottle tips over, all of the water doesn't come out, even if the spout is open. It will only slowly leak. I can lay the Contigo on the car seat on its side if the spout is closed with no leaking.I bought the original because it had BPA free materials as does this new one. This is a really good bottle and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZZSZHBZZYJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYBBYN8#wasThisHelpful","R1VZZSZHBZZYJN","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have played horseshoes many times during my life. I've even had horseshoe pits in the yard from time to time, but always removed them. It seems they go for quite awhile without playing and then are in the way.The Viva Sol set in a box looked like a good idea to me.The steel posts are very nice and are pounded into the ground about 9-10 inches. Easy in and easy out. The whole set fits securely into the box and can then be put away when finished. Having the set available and easy to set up is the answer for me. I like playing them in a family or friend gathering and then remove them.The horseshoes are just as they should be and have a good paint coating on them for longevity. They throw well and the posts are secure.The set comes with directions to set up a permanent pit, but I find the portability of the set a very nice feature. As with other Viva Sol games, the box is great looking, strong and well designed. Everything fits securely without rattling around. This is a very nice set to either use as a permanent pit or to just use as you wish, at home, on the beach or elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OV52MHHVML6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBIXS8U#wasThisHelpful","R2OV52MHHVML6J","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I applaud Campbell's for trying their hand at Organic soup. I wish that I would have received more than one small box to review so that I could have given it a better test. My wife and I split a box which is really enough for one person. I must mention that the box opens in a simple, but ingenious way. No spill, no scissors.My wife found the soup a little bland, likely... since it doesn't have as much salt as many soups. She does love salty food. I found the Chicken Noodle to have a more sophisticated flavor than the soups I had as a kid, though I did add a little salt as well. I will order it again for those times when I want a quick meal. I liked it. We eat mostly organic, local and home grown food and I am always on the lookout for organic foods.The main reason that I am glad to see this soup is that it does not contain MSG. When I was a kid, we had a lot of Campbell's Chicken Noodle, Tomato and Mushroom soup (in casseroles). Unfortunately, I had headaches few times a week throughout much of my childhood and teens. It wasn't until I was well into adulthood that I learned it was from MSG in the soups. Also, we had Accent on the table in a shaker which I sometimes used.For those who are interested... MSG is a natural byproduct of the sugar refining process, it acts as a flavor enhancer, not a spice. I read it described in this way, if a chicken soup required 5 chickens in the soup to give it a certain intensity of flavor, if you add MSG it only requires one chicken for the same flavor. MSG is cheaper than chicken. I also found that as much as ten percent of the population has bad reactions to MSG. Asian and Mexican restaurants used to be the big users of MSG. Many have stopped. Also, having been a teacher, I had access to the school cafeteria kitchen. It is still used to a great extent in schools especially in gravy and sauces. In one gravy in which I checked ingredients, MSG came up in three different parts of the gravy mix. ( I missed 3 days of work with a headache among other nasty reactions) I then came back and checked the ingredients.The bottom line is that I thought the Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup was very good and I am grateful for organic ingredients and no MSG.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNV7B1G6GVYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5WYV6M#wasThisHelpful","R2FNV7B1G6GVYM","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Primos 12MP Proof Cam 48 HD Trail Camera takes videos at a much higher quality than my old VHS shoulder mounted camera of yesteryear. Since I don't have the time to get the camera into the woods until later this month (Aug.) I did some tests on it at home.I have used game cameras for about 5 years now and have three of them. One was cheap (died after one season) and two were moderately priced.The Primos is the smallest of them. It is the easiest to use: open the camera door, put in 8 AA batteries. Turn to set up and set the time with button arrows. Set the photo quality with a slide button. Set it to photo, video or both with another slide button. Set the time interval between shots with another slide button. Attach it to the tree, turn it on, close it up, done.My other cameras use mini-bungee cords to attach to the tree, the Primos uses a dull-green strap with an infinite adjusting latch. This is very nice.The problem with the black mini-bungees and me...I keep dropping them. The strap will fit from about a 3 inch diameter tree up to 20 inch diameter. This more versatile than the bungees.This camera does not come with batteries or a SDHC memory card so make sure you get them. The memory card fits into the side of the camera so it's easy to get to while attached to the tree. The batteries are in the cover and easy to access also. The weather proofing of this unit seems good, but only a few months in the woods will really tell. Also it has a camera tri-pod mount if you wish to use it that way.I set up the camera in the kitchen at 3 second interval photos at low definition. I have about 50 shots of my ""dear"". The quality is good and she never realized what was happening. I then put it into the backyard near a wooded area for about 24 hours. I got a few pictures of me walking around during the day (super quality) and some very good quality shots of three different cats and a possum at night. The day shots were always perfect, the night shots very good when still, and average quality when moving. The light in the night shots was more than adequate.Next I tried the video, using myself as the subject which is very disturbing at my age. The video was really of good quality.Of the cameras that I have used, this is by far the best. It is definitely the easiest to use. It seems that, as with most electronics, the game cameras are getting better at a lower price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E8VM4IQ80AZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP85YUE#wasThisHelpful","R3E8VM4IQ80AZZ","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this new GolfBuddy WT5 Golf GPS Watch. I have tried the hand held Garmin, a cheaper variety GPS watch which died after a year, and the GolfBuddy VT3. Perhaps the biggest difference between the various units that I have had is the battery life.The Garmin hand held would last at most 2 rounds and then the double A batteries would need replacing. The cheap watch model would last one round on a charge. The GolfBuddy VT3 would last one round on a charge though sometimes it would quit on the 18th hole. The GolfBuddy WT5 lasted 27 holes during this weeks playing and according to the battery symbol still had about 40% battery life left yet.The GolfBuddy VT3 could be worn as a watch, clipped to the hat or kept in a pocket, the WT5 is a watch only. The VT3 had a sound option for distance which I finally found just irritating rather than helpful. The WT5 has no sound option. The VT3 had a touch screen which did not seem to be sensitive enough, so worked very poorly. The WT5 has buttons to change functions, which I prefer. The yardage numbers on the WT5 are large and very easy to see even without my reading glasses. The VT3 took hours, usually overnight to re-charge. The WT5 took about 1 1/2 hours.Getting to the added functions such as of getting hazard distances on the WT5 is easy. Also the time of day is almost always displayed and is set by the unit each time it connects to the satellite.The band on the WT5 is soft plastic (like rubber) and is reasonably comfortable with a lot of holes so that it can fit any wrist. The WT5 is a little smaller and much lighter than the VT3 that I have been using.Overall I find the GolfBuddy WT5 the best GPS that I have used for the needs that I have. It gives me front, back and middle of green distances, hazards, time, scoring options and a few added options that I seldom would use such as dynamic green view. I like this unit a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R329HVJKKHWSG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOYN7J8#wasThisHelpful","R329HVJKKHWSG3","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I find that as a shampoo, it works as well as any that I have used.Since a body wash is new to me, I can only compare it to the bar soap I have used. I find that it leaves the feeling of having used soft water on my skin. My bar soap feels ""squeaky"", unlike the slick feeling of soft water washing. The Suave feels good, just different. We don't have soft water but using the Suave makes it feel a bit that way. The scent is pleasant, not too strong, but I would prefer unscented. I can't really pin down what the scent is like to describe it. I haven't decided whether I will abandon my bar soap yet. The wash is easier to use.

"I am seldom as impressed with anything like the way I was blown away by the A5PRO DJ headphones. The sound is expansive and complete. The whole room is in your head. The distortion is less than 0.1% THD. This, like most things is relative and does not always mean much since all really good headphones will be in that range. More importantly is how they sound to you the listener.I am no youngster so I sampled some of the music that I have listened to for years. It included Emmy Lou Harris, Gordon Lightfoot, Jimmi Hendrix, Neal young, Clannad. The Beatles, and Crosby, Stills and Nash.  I have a headset for my computer, one for my Android and several for my sound system. What I heard with the A5PRO really amazed me. I could discern separate instruments that I never heard before. I noticed a tambourine in a Mamas and Papas song, that I had never knew was there. Some of the qualities in Hendrix's voice amazed me since I always thought that he had no real depth in his voice. I could hear, and feel, the drums in songs as a separate sound rather than just a beat. I found even at fairly high volume that I could not notice any distortion.The headphones have a large L and R on the side of the phones for right and left, quick glance, got it. The foam pads are comfortable and can be changed. The pads really keep out room noise very well. I like the fact that the cable can be plugged into either side and the jack screws on so that it does not just fall off with movement. The phones have the option of three different ear pads. I have the large round pad, I would prefer the large oval that would cover my whole ear, since at times I wear hearing aids which are behind the top of my ear. I seldom where them with headphones on, but it would be better at times.As you can tell, I really an impressed with the A5PRO.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHTQQ71SY5W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU2KJSO#wasThisHelpful","RAHTQQ71SY5W3","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Extreme Max BoatTector 24"" will be replacing some round boat to dock protectors that I managed to loose in Canada. Like any of these devises, They are light and can be blown out of the boat or if not tied down securely, during a windy night.  The boat where I am using the protectors is a 16 foot fishing boat (Lowe). The BoatTextors fit well over the side of the boat and onto the gunwales. This will likely give added protection in windy conditions. I was concerned that the flat design might not give as much protection as the round type, but on examination, I don't feel this is the case. The foam inside the protectors is firm, slightly spongy and appears to have a tough covering. The ropes are substantial and  easy to use. I have two compartment in the boat that have doors that lift up and close tightly. They are in the position where I put the BoatTectors so I put the ropes into the compartments with the protectors in the right position and then close the compartment doors on the ropes. This is very secure on my boat, and quick. The Extreme Max fold at the crease and will easily fit into my boats compartments when not in use.Like all boat to dock/boat protectors, in very heavy waves, there is always the chance that the top edge of the boat gunwale will hit the dock at the top of the protector. I believe this could happen to the Extreme Max as well. I'm not aware of any good options in heavy waves other than getting the boat out of the water. Overall, the Extreme Max has so far worked very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWP9W3BWU3ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4HFNXK#wasThisHelpful","R1YWP9W3BWU3ML","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Minky retractable Reel Outdoor Dryer (clothesline) appears to be very good. I've just started using it. The product seems very substantial and hopefully will last for years. The lines come out easily and clip onto the cross beam/pole that I placed in the yard. The unit comes with ? shaped hooks to screw into the cross beam and inserts for the screws which attach the base unit into a wall. The screws provided are used directly into the wooden wall without the inserts.There is a lot of line on each of the spools; likely to be used as the other line would age, weather and perhaps break. I used only 1/6th of the spool line since I placed the post only 15 feet from the wall.Attaching the line to the spool unit when it is pulled out for use, is simple, but will take a bit of practice to get the line tight. The farther the line is out the more it would have a tendency to sag. The Reel looks good, I like not always having the line out all the time and I only have one small post in the yard now.

"The Black & Decker Performance FusionBlade Blender is a 4 to 5 star product. I have had many blenders for review and also had and used, many others at friends homes since I have made smoothies every day for about 7-8 years. I will compare them and list the functions of the Performance Blender.The Performance has 5 pre-programmed settings:  number 1 - soup -  blends gradually slow to fast with fairly short blending time  number 2 - nut butters -  starts with a slow pulse, then pulses faster until finished  number 3 - personal jar/half recipes -  slow to fast pulse, then very fast until stopped  number 4 - dry goods -  short time at slow, medium for awhile then very fast  number 5 - smoothies - slow to medium with long pulse action, then fast until the endThe personal blender jar would be good for individual smoothies. It has an extra lid which seals with a drinking spout. This could be taken with you like any water container. The lid with the blade comes off and the drinking lid is then attached.The Performance Blender can also be used at various speeds and a manual pulse feature. It comes with a short cookbook. Hot food may be used with the the large jar only.I made a few smoothies, crushed ice for snow cones and tried all of the various settings. The smoothies were very smooth, about the same as my $200 blender but not nearly as smooth as my Jamba blender which cost about 4-5 times the price as the Performance. All were much smoother than the Ninja I tried and the cheap blenders that I have used. When I made the snow cone ice, the lid of the Performance nearly flew off, I then realized that the lid snaps down around the jar lid which I had not done.  It was secure after that.The noise level is about average for a better blender, not the horrible whine of the ""cheapies"". My most expensive blender when on high is the loudest, but it goes much faster.I have noticed that the better blenders do not have the sharp blades of the old blenders, for whatever reason they work better that way. Also, the odd shaped jars seem to work better than the smooth round jars. This blender has a large base and is taller than most. Almost all of the blenders have a plastic jar, though glass ones can be found. The Performance is plastic which I prefer, because of the light weight. The drive gears between the jar and the machine base are a semi-hard plastic as with most blenders. The very expensive blenders have metal gears. It is impossible to address the longevity of any of the blenders. I had an inexpensive old Marvelizer which ran for about 20 years and a friend had a $600. blender that didn't make it a year. Only time will tell. This Black & Decker Blender is a very good blender for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ES9ZKF76FK18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXLNO#wasThisHelpful","R1ES9ZKF76FK18","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dove Men+Care Bar seemed to have a very strong fragrance when I opened the package. I thought, this will be a bit too much for me. But... when I use it in the shower it is not too strong at all. It has the fragrance of a light old style men's cologne that I can't place. One problem that I have always had with Dove is that it got so soft and mushy after use. Though this bar is softer than my usual hard bar soap, it is not at all as soft as the regular Dove.I am always very skeptical of products made just for men/women, so I tried the Dove with that attitude. I'm still not sold that a product such as this is truly designed with some ingredients that work better for one sex or the other. I did find the soap pleasant enough and it surprisingly did make a difference in the texture of my skin. It does feel less dry, though it being  mid-summer, it is not the true test. Only our dry winters will tell.My wife thought it was nice, oops wrong gender.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45KYADEXQW8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS81M58#wasThisHelpful","R45KYADEXQW8H","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in my mid sixties and was told by my doctor to to take B-12. This was especially important since I had been taking some prescriptions which depleted B-12 in my system. I have been taking B-12 for several years now and will continue. I have used Jarrow products before and do feel that they are good. The dosage of about 2000-2500 mg daily is what is recommended by my doctor.I have never taken the time to research the information on B-12 and so I just take the advise of my doctor and Jarrow that it is beneficial. There is no way to really tell if it is working since brain function is so subjective anyway.

"I am new to label printing and have not used shipping labels previously. I ordered the Avery White Shipping Labels for my wife's business to be used with a list of patrons. Since I had not done this before, I went to the Avery web site and put in the product number (the large number on the label box). This brought up a very big list of possible templates to use. The templates covered various business types and many other possibilities, such as Christmas labels. I will later explore using my wife's own logo on a blank or designed template.I picked a template and proceeded to try my first printing. The directions, and use of available options, were simple to follow. Very important to me... any mistakes could be easily corrected. After I put in the information on the sample label, a preview appeared of how the labels would look on the label page. I checked my spelling again and pressed print.As I pressed print, I was advised to make a change in my printer's settings. This was changed with an Avery prompt and was easy to do. I appreciated this prompt as opposed to just allowing me to print it incorrectly. At this point I'm about 7-8 minutes into my first label printing. As far as I'm concerned, no time at all. I pressed print again and the shipping labels printed out perfectly. The quality is excellent. One option on the Avery site was to go to their videos on YouTube by clicking an icon on the Avery printing page. The videos allowed me to see and understand the other options and many possibilities for the labels. These videos were very easy to understand. They are excellent.Overall... I found the whole procedure to print labels easy and enjoyable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPY2LBZGISOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIYVI5O#wasThisHelpful","R3NPY2LBZGISOL","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main ingredient in Sundown Naturals Heart Balance is Terminalia Arjuna Bark. It has been used for thousands of years as part of the Ayurvedic health system in India. I have tried this supplement with no noticeable side effects. As far as helping the heart, this is rather hard to determine without scientific studies. One is taking the word of the company producing it and a study of Ayurved.I have taken various Ayurved supplements off and on for about 35 years and have gathered some information on them. Most traditional Ayurvedic ""doctors"" in this practice will indicate that the picking or harvesting of the ingredients is very important. The time of the year, time of day and even the picker has an affect on the product. The way it is processed and handled is also very important to its effectiveness and safety. It is hard to determine whether the correct procedures have been followed with any products.There is some evidence that Arjuna can cause a decrease in blood sugar and so diabetics should be aware of this. As with many supplements pregnant or nursing women should be careful.Only more time will tell whether this particular supplement works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GATPNLYEPLYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUHCVEY#wasThisHelpful","R1GATPNLYEPLYL","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with the Philips F1/27 Fidelio Headset. The sound is the best that I have heard through a headset. I have a Logitech noise cancelling set and a few others. This headset is light and easy to forget you are wearing it. The foam molds around my ears and blocks off much of the sound occurring around me. Though this set would probably not stay on well for jogging, it does stay on well for working around the house .I have been using the Fidelio with my MotoX phone listening to  Amazon Prime Music.The button on the headset cord will pause, not just mute, the sound and return to playing with another push. The sound volume is controlled on the phone.When a call is received on the phone, the music pauses and the call comes through the headset. My response is then picked up by mike in the headset and comes through clearly to the person calling. I am somewhat hard of hearing and wear hearing aids except when I'm on the phone. Listening through the Fidelio gives me the best sound quality that I have had in quite some some on the phone. It is always easiest for me to hear music and TV through a headset than speakers in any case, but the Fidelio has really made it great to listen to music and to hear voices on the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X87O58GY8TZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3A0LRS#wasThisHelpful","R2X87O58GY8TZP","A3U5HKDHPYBAK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U5HKDHPYBAK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Banquet of Consequences: A Lynley Novel.... is unlike my usual murder mystery read. It is long and it took about 180 pages of character introduction and development before a murder was even committed. Though this book is extremely well written and the characters are as real as can be, it developed a bit slow for me.When all of the introduction was completed, I must say that it became hard to put down. When I ordered it, I thought it would be another quick and easy detective type novel, but it is much more than that. This is a really good book and the only reason for any negative comments in this review, is that it was not a perfect fit for me.

I wouldn't knowingly buy dented cans at the grocery store; I don't want them from Amazon, and especially not when I am paying for them - this ain't no food pantry.I liked that these carrots had no salt.

"I'm kicking myself for NOT verifying the oven temperature before the 30-day return window slammed shut. (Suspicious, I only thought too late to put an oven thermometer inside.) Worse, I recycled the box and packaging it came in so I no longer have a way of shipping it back to Black & Decker even if I wanted to go to the trouble, which I don't. Did I miss the reviews that said this oven doesn't get hot enough? Maybe, because for whatever reason, I just assumed it was actually reaching the temperature IT IS SET TO. Naive me. The oven won't reach 350 degrees when set at the highest indicator of 450 degrees. I did not want a giant toaster; I wanted a working oven.There's nothing else worth saying about it given its fatal flaw.EDIT Jul 21: This is weird. If I set the oven for 350 degrees, it won't reach it, even if I subsequently turn up the temperature dial past 350. However, it seems recently that if I initially set the dial at its highest temp of 450 degrees, the oven *will* get hotter. What a pain.

"I read the reviews and info and went with a large, although I wear a US small. It fit - more or less - at first. The fabric is of decent weight and quality and I like how the back dips lower. If you have a little booty - as do most of us - the shirt will bunch or roll a little there as opposed to flowing over your backside, but it still looks okay. Initially, I liked it enough to consider buying a second one but I'm glad I didn't. The sleeves, even on this large, are just too snug and moreover, the neckline is too loose (and increasingly so with wear). I washed the shirt about 3 times and the neckline became too stretched out and loose. I'd consider buying other Doublju shirts but only with a more fitted neckline so they wouldn't have a chance to stretch out as this one has. The too-tight sleeves and too loose neckline made for a weird fit. I donated it. Not a good buy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDFP2CL74D2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZM6UCG#wasThisHelpful","RCDFP2CL74D2P","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a size 8.5 and these were an accurate fit (I see that it says above that I bought size 6 but I actually bought 8.5). The color is more vibrant than it appears on my computer screen, which is a *good* thing. I wouldn't call them orange so much as a cross between orange and pink. I love it. I'm dinging a star because the quality isn't stellar and they don't look like they'll have an especially long life; they are definitely more ""fashion"" than athletic.The stitching around the tongue in particular is sort of cheap looking. Other than that, they look good. I swapped out the black laces for neon green and that makes them positively pop. When I was a kid, we didn't have shoes like these and I am delighted, at my age, to now have such a fabulous pair! I've been admiring bright shoes on kids for years; it's a little late, but not too late for me to be a cool kid.EDIT/NOTE Apr 6: I wore them for the first time yesterday, taking an under 2 miles walk, leisurely walk. After, I looked at the shoe bottoms - already showing wear at the heel!! Are you kidding me?? If you know of any clever way to protect the sole, I'd strongly suggest doing so before wearing these shoes. Too bad - they are so cute, and for casual walking, comfortable.

"UPDATE March 2015: I initially said good things about these slippers but once I washed them midwinter it all went downhill. They became way too loose so they don't stay on which is potentially hazardous, particularly on stairs. I am trying to ""grab* them on with my toes as I walk - which is both a nuisance and from what I've read, unhealthy for the foot (podiatrists don't like grab-on style shoes, like flip-flops and certain sandals). Insult to injury, all the cushy-ness in the bottom disappeared - whether from wear or washing, they are now flat, flat, flat, with no support. I think Isotoner is riding along on the weight of its name, which used to represent quality. I've also had junky gloves and umbrellas from them in recent years. These slippers didn't last one winter. Buh-bye Isotoner: you charge too much for your diminished quality.EARLIER REVIEW: I generally wear size 8.5 and these fit just fine. Initially, I had to take my forefinger to ""hook"" my foot into the back but over a short time, they loosened enough so that I could just step into them. They are VERY comfortable, but as others have noted, low on style with a fairly utilitarian look. I really like having a substantial sole, which makes the slippers more shoe-like. There are winter days I spend hours in these so I want that support. I knew before purchase that I wouldn't like that white cuff because it was sure to get dingy looking - and I was right about that.You should know that while they are machine-washable, the instructions say not to put the slippers in a dryer. That wasn't going to be an issue for me since there is no dryer available where I live. HOWEVER...when I washed them for the first time this winter, they took 3 days to completely dry! That is not entirely practical and I don't imagine I'll be rushing to wash them too frequently.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KXC8122G4V02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT4B39E#wasThisHelpful","R1KXC8122G4V02","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike most of the other reviewers so far, I was unimpressed with these leggings. The color is nice, but other than that, they are cheaply made. The weave is thin and open.

"I bought this for the color - lime green - and that is its best feature. It is small but I expect it'll be useful to me this summer for toting around lightweight items. On the plus side, the inside seams are covered, lending reinforcement. On the not-so-plus side, the zippers do not move easily; in fact that edge of fabric that can be seen going over the larger of the two zippers sort of gets in the way of easily zipping and unzipping. I have a feeling the fact they don't zip easily may be irritating. Unlike other backpacks I've owned, this one has no padding on the back to protect its wearer from being stabbed by whatever is in the pack. (That *may* be advantageous in summer because thick paddings in backpacks make my back sweat on steamy summer days and I suppose, add to the weight, if only a little).

"I chose a medium based on the sizing suggestion to go up one size. Despite Asian sizing, I figured that since the top is both described as loose and appears to flow over the model's hips, that would allow for some fit leeway (I'm 5'8"", 125, and would typically opt for a US small).What none of the photos show though, is that on both sides, at about hip level, there are effectively DARTS sewn in (2 on either side) -- darts, usually found at the chest. I was so confused at this styling that I checked to make sure both sides had them and it wasn't just a defect! The upper part of the blouse is loose on me and the sleeves are nice & long (I have long arms), but the bottom is close to my hips AND bunches oddly because of those darts. If you like the look of Oompa Loompa hips, this is the shirt for you.The fabric, described as flannel, is soft but thin. It wouldn't keep you warm in winter. The color is not quite as vibrant. The workmanship is poor - not only were there big loose threads under the sleeve, but it had been incorrectly stitched so that about an inch of unfinished seam sticks out and shows on the OUTSIDE (i.e., ""right"" side of the garment).","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S7DWXE8E0S6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW4N6AM#wasThisHelpful","R2S7DWXE8E0S6G","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a woman, 5`8"", 125 lbs. I got a small and it's definitely baggy and loose on me, but not so much so that it looks like I'm wearing somebody else's clothes. The sweatshirt is very comfortable and cozy, not to mention I picked it up for an excellent price. However, now that I've worn & washed it a couple times, I see the dreaded *pilling* on the front of the pocket. This irritates me. So far, the pilling seems concentrated in that area, so I can only wonder if it's caused by wearing my winter coat over the sweatshirt (i.e., the two fabrics rubbing?) The color isn't as vibrant now either, which is not unexpected with red, but I had hoped that the 50/50 poly/cotton blend would help keep the color longer (all cotton usually means you can say goodbye to bright colors in short order).I really do like this sweatshirt and don't regret the purchase but would likely be disinclined to buy again.

"This is the third ""lamp in a box"" I purchased. As you might guess, I really like these lamps. They combine two things I love: light and art.

The design makes me think of Aztec art.The lamp, from Amazon Warehouse, did not actually work on arrival, but I was able to reattach the wire which I discovered had come loose (I realize not everybody would know how, or want to do that).

"I have used Umbra Tub Dish Drying Rack, Red for the last 2 years and having used this Basin drain for less than a week, I can already tell you it's a better design. This one drains water more effectively, will be easier to clean, and keeps dishes, especially bowls, glasses, and cups, raised so that they aren't sitting in water and/or muck that may accumulate below (all issues with the Umbra Tub model).I took note of the problems people have had with this model not clearing the lip of their sink. My sink has a relatively low edge and I placed the front legs of the drain onto it. To remedy the problem of that end then being counter-productively higher than the opposite end, I placed a small board under the now-lower end's legs. It is worth it to me, given how much I like these Umbra Drains, as compared to standard 2-piece models, to do a few compensatory things to make it work for me.I delight in seeing water actually drip out of the end of the funnel, the way it should! The fact that the funnel/spout can be removed to clean isn't of great benefit - how cruddy can it get? And besides, dishes will never touch it.In order to get the most counter space, I've got the drain pushed all the way to the back of the counter. This means the spout does not line up exactly with the sink but instead with the back stainless steel. Nonetheless, water hits that surface and THEN empties it the sink, so it's working. (Umbra should consider that most sinks will sit further out than does their small dish drain.)As I said, I can already see I like this one better and know it will both *stay* cleaner and be easier to clean than the other Umbra model I owned. And it looks terrific too. Sleek and modern.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YKC26AXJS90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008R52OEA#wasThisHelpful","R9YKC26AXJS90","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I took a chance on these because they were a tad cheaper per pound than the Bob's Red Mill Brown Sesame Seeds (i.e., with ""shell"") that I usually buy. From online research, I found that black seeds have comparable nutrients which is what I want (the traditional white are stripped of some beneficial nutrients).The first thing that I didn't like was the absence of any production or expiration date on the bottle. I went to Colorado Spices website and there, under FAQS, was the claim that all their bottled spices show an expiration date on the front label. Mine did not.  I tried the seeds and found them on the bitter end of the spectrum and dry. They left a bad taste (literally). Admittedly, I have not purchased black seeds before but I have eaten them on bread products and I have the Bob's brown for comparison.

"This isn't the first time I've bought girl's underwear for myself, an adult woman, but it is my first time trying Hanes. I saw a few other reviews where women said they're bought the hipsters for themselves so I decided to see. I bought size 16 and they do fit my 36.5"" hips. I think they might work up to 37"" hips but no more. I was initially discouraged after trying a pair because there was some cheek-showage in the back that I really don't like; however I tried on the other 8 and they had fuller coverage so I was happy. The best thing I can tell you about these Hanes hipsters is that I was unaware of them being on me the first day I wore them - that is they weren't sliding down, cutting into me or doing any of the other annoying things underwear can do. They were COMFORTABLE and that's excellent news.They are not high end of course, with inexpensive, thin cotton, and slight variations in cut from one to the next (like one pair sits lower on my hips than the others), and I don't yet know how washing will affect them (shrinkage, etc.), but for the price, it's expected. I had give up some years ago on Fruit of the Loom's shoddily-made, fall-apart, cotton underwear, and needed a substitute.The color assortment I received isn't necessarily the first I'd have selected given a choice but they aren't bad either. In my collection are: one white with blue flowers, 3 white with blue trim (rather see-thru), pink with blue trim, dark blue, pink with loud blue design,light blue, and blue-striped.May 2015: Back to say they are washing and wearing well.

The sizing, however, as mentioned by another reviewer, is indeed odd. I'm 5` 8 inches, a solid 125 pounds, with long arms & legs. I started with a medium, and while the sleeves and legs were long enough, the rest was baggy and loose (not fitted and cute like pictured). So I returned that and went for the small. Much better. They feel cozy. The shoulders are a bit snug but that's my build. Oh, also as mentioned by the other reviewer, the quality isn't top-o-the-line, what with one leg being longer than the other! I decided for the price, the grown-up cuteness factor, and the interesting zipper-front styling, that I could live with that. I think I'll be very happy to have these this winter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M7WDHGU5ES5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E39MHGY#wasThisHelpful","R3M7WDHGU5ES5X","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm a woman and my hand, from base to end of longest finger, is 7"". These gloves, advertised as being 10 and 1/8"" long, are actually 9.5"" at their longest. The fingers are way too short, so that I can't move my fingers. It feels like wearing catcher's mitts or unfunny hand puppets. They tag says they're for ""Demolition Roofing Fencing."" Maybe so, if tiny women or children will be wearing these to do demolition, roofing, and fencing.

"I bought these for myself when the price dropped. I'm a fan of Jessica Seinfeld's books because even as an adult, I need incentive to eat more vegetables. Jessica's recipes have been a big help to me (although I modify them to my low-sugar, low-fat, mostly vegetarian diet). My efforts at pureeing veggies have been mixed and moreover I'm working in a small space, which makes the process a bit of a pain. I am delighted with the carrot flavor and have been eating it straight out of the pouch. It's that good. Sure, I understand fiber is being lost as is the benefit to teeth (a soft diet isn't great for dental health), BUT the carrots I've been buying in grocery stores for years - with one huge exception, Premier brand, when I can find it - taste terrible! I buy them with good intentions, even organic ones, and they languish in the refrigerator. If they tasted good, I'd be eating them.

That's when I found this amazing deal: 34 cents TOTAL to receive these flower seeds from China. Wow! No matter how things turned out, how could I miss? I will tell you how. I germinated them indoors at the appropriate time to get a head start (as slugs, etc., tend to eat seedlings  of mine started outside). When all was said and done, only ONE vine survived. I watered it and kept an eye on it for months. Vines, leaves and no flowers resulted. Finally, on Aug 20, I was rewarded for my patience. With a lousy flower that looks NOTHING like the product photo. The flower is flat and one-dimensional, as opposed to the thick, multi-petaled bloom in the photo.

"I like glass refrigerator storage for anything greasy or oily, like pizza, lasagna, or pasta dishes. Plastic just doesn't clean up as well and over time gets/stays a little funky and off-color. I wanted something like this without having to buy a set. This dish has a good, solid weight to it; it feels heavy, not flimsy and easily broken. I was a bit surprised to discover the lid has what could be described as a rubber seal. I'm not too crazy about that, especially that it has a lip, which will make it trickier to clean (I'll put a picture in Customer Images). The box says ""For a correct use, it is recommended not to fill the container completely."" I imagine that's because the lid's seal protrudes into the dish.The inside dimension of the glass dish is 7"" (smaller than listed) and the height, without lid, is 3"". The container can go in the freezer up to -20°C/-4Â°F and the microwave to +70Â°C/+158Â°F. No stovetop or oven use. It is made in Italy as advertised. It may be silly, but as I'm half-Italian, I kind of like that, plus I do think of Italian goods as generally being well-made. Love my purple lid!One feature I like already is that I can easily pull this forward by the lid when it's in the fridge with fingertips alone. We've got a small fridge and I have to bend & reach to haul stuff out so I appreciate anything that comes out readily.  Finally, I got a deal at under 6 bucks. For that, I am most certainly pleased.

The jar measures 3.5"" wide on all sides and 7.5"" tall (without the lid), so it is smaller than the dimensions listed. The jar surprisingly did not come in a box, so the Amazon measurements were not describing the packaging size as sometimes is the case. It does not hold 1.5 liters but a bit less.

That's all well and good, but further injuring myself is just not an option. The only thing I might suggest, is that my calf is muscular and at its widest is about 13.25"". But nowhere on the description is there any suggestion that a muscled calf might impede getting the brace on (look, I was just stretching here anyway, trying to find any explanation for such gross size discrepancies).

"I have been using my blender happily for about 6 months. It's been great, particularly for the price (I paid ten bucks from Amazon Warehouse). One of the keys to its use is to remember it doesn't have an on/off button but a pulse button. It's not meant to be run for long, unbroken periods (think of what the human ""pulse"" is: on, off, on, off). I expect pulsing is the key to not frying the tiny motor. Because the cup is plastic, I avoid using any greasy or oily substances (like peanut butter) because plastic just doesn't clean up the way glass does. Also, the bottom is not removable but all of a piece so it can be tricky to really feel like the blades and bottom are properly cleaned. For these 2 minor issues, I ding a star.

I am fairly certain I have bought the same chain in the past from a store and generally think of the Blue Moon as decent quality, a step up from Darice, say (and priced a bit higher).

I'm a convert; not sure I could go back to the cheap, odd-colored ones I formerly used.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R212Y0TWAWUJNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VECJBG#wasThisHelpful","R212Y0TWAWUJNR","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I waited till I used up the whole tube before saying that my teeth look no different from before I started. Darn. I found it at Dollar Tree so it wasn't a big risk. The ingredients are unremarkable: Sodium Fluoride 0.24 % (Anticavity), followed by the Inactive ingredients: Water, Hydrated Silica, Sorbitol, Glycerin, PEG-12, Titanium Dioxide, Flavor, Cellulose Gum, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Saccharin, Sodium Benzoate. The toothpaste is supposed to ""remove"" coffee, tea, wine & tobacco stains.

"The presence of the always watchable Naveen Andrews is the only reason I gave this film two stars instead of one. He doesn't have much to work with, but his intelligence and integrity - and plausibility as Dr. Hasnat Khan - come through nevertheless.I knew the film was in trouble from the start. Naomi Watts looks more like Camilla Parker Bowles than Diana, particularly in a few of the misguided hairstyles the actress sports. I'm sorry, but Watts is TOO OLD for the part and I found myself staring intently at her face for all the wrong reasons. Diana had a magical, lit-from-within quality, a compelling way of carrying herself; in fact, in her later years, what would only be called regal bearing. Diana, whatever her faults (and most of us, the public, have been schooled in them over the years) was stunning. Watts as Diana, is none of these things. She is dull as tepid swimming pool water. Flat, uninteresting, charmless. It's inconceivable that Watts' character might have ever captured the attention of the future King of England (who inexplicably makes no appearance in the film), let alone the numbers of other men, she apparently did, including a brilliant heart surgeon. There's no chemistry, sexual or otherwise, between Watts' Diana and Andrews' Khan, which is more misfortune. I found myself slogging through their affair, uninterested and unprovoked to dredge up any feelings about it one way or the other.Despite the money poured into the production, evident from the lush sets, locations, clothes, etc., this film has made-for-TV all over it. I became embarrassed for the participants as I watched it. Speaking of, most of the people in the film seem to serve as living props - nobody really makes their presence felt in a meaningful way. Again, the script doesn't help matters.Thankfully, the film does not dramatize the car accident which killed Diana. I think that would have been unforgivable in this limp, uninspired production.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WG9IU7W4WQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM7STPI#wasThisHelpful","R28WG9IU7W4WQQ","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great bags! I paid just under 7 bucks three years ago and I think that was a fair price. Evidently, they've gone higher and stayed higher since. I use them weekly, at least the two small ones. I started putting my undies in one right away and I think that's extended the life span of said dainties. It's very nice to use the bags for other *iffy* items that might generally require hand-washing and wouldn't enjoy laundry rough-housing.The drawstrings on both the small bags broke in recent months, but when I got around to it, replacing the strings wasn't any trouble. The hem on one also required stitching where it was pulling apart.

"I wish I could rate these about 3.5 stars. The lower sodium is a great idea, but the chips are a bit greasier than they need to be. Cut that oil and you'd have yourself a crisp, tasty, 5-star chip.Lay's isn't pretending this is a low-sodium food, which they admit right on the bag. The difference is a 1 oz portion of Lay's Wavy Original Potato Chips has 140mg sodium, whereas the Lightly Salted contains 70mg sodium for the same amount. The ingredients are: Potatoes, Vegetable oil (Sunflower, Corn and/or Canola oil), and Salt.Much as I love them, I rarely eat chips because of the fat and salt; they are a treat I indulge only a couple times a year. The portion sizes, as is true of almost all foods like chips, are absurd. Lay's considers there to be 10 portions in this 9.5 oz bag. Who eats chips like that?! Not me! I thought I was doing well to make this 3 portions, which I gobbled down in 3 consecutive days. That's 1600 calories total, 900 of them fat.I'd buy these again, but not any time soon, as I'm not to be trusted in the vicinity of an open bag of good potato Chips.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UNJZQBYX31OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052Y7YL2#wasThisHelpful","R1UNJZQBYX31OO","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't buy the mustard from Amazon. I first discovered [[ASIN:B00473XF58 Koops Mustard Deli Spicy Brown, 12-Ounce (Pack of 6)] and that led to trying this horseradish variety. Ohhh, it's good! Kicky but not overbearing. If it's too horseradish-y for your taste, you can just use a lighter hand in pouring.

"With the product description's emphasis on ""wind patterns"" and use with plants, I really wasn't sure if it would be suitable for indoor use. It is. It doesn't feel like the wind (what wind oscillates, in a distinct repeated pattern no less??), but feels like a regular fan. That part is fine.I haven't had it very long and am torn between a 3 or 4 star rating. I need a little more time to see if it merits a 4. It doesn't exactly shout ""fine craftsmanship."" The fan blade itself - well, let's not kid ourselves, it's hardly a ""blade"" - is made of cheap, thin, clear plastic. I get that the days of finding an actual metal blade in a low-end fan are over, but this blade is especially flimsy-looking. It does not look like a part that'll last. I hope I'm wrong. It's small compared to the housing too. It's just odd to have this big fan and one of the most important features (maybe second to the motor) looks like such a cheap afterthought. The fan wobbles a bit too, the more so if you want to extend the height.I did not find assembly difficult. I won't tell you it was fun or enjoyable, but the instructions made sense to me and I figured it out. When summer hits and I'm relying on the fan a lot, I'll try to revisit this review.JULY 19, 2014 update: It's been plenty hot this summer on the East coast and I'm sticking with  (or in this climate, ""sticking to"")  my 3 stars. This is not a powerful fan. The flimsy, small plastic blade is simply not powerful. I got a good Warehouse deal on this fan so if it lasts a couple seasons, I'll be happy. If you want it for indoor use, just don't expect gushing winds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QF01HWWXI3JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWJGMM#wasThisHelpful","R2QF01HWWXI3JS","A1VXZJVVLQNX9G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VXZJVVLQNX9G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full plot outlines are easy to come by in other reviews here or elsewhere. I want to review this film strictly to tell you it's worth your time to see an actress at the top of her game. From Amy Madigan's first frame, she's riveting. People talk about roles where all of an actor's personal vanity is dropped. This is one of those. You will not catch her acting; she even *thinks* in character.I have a deep appreciation for anyone who spends decades honing their skill in any field. Their mastery is a gift for the rest of us. I will be far from the first person to lament the absence of roles in filmdom for older people, especially actresses. It's a damn shame when the best far too often have to sit out on the sidelines.

"Oh man, are these good. I didn't buy them from Amazon but they're commonly available at grocery stores. I buy tortilla chips or any kind of chips for that matter, as a rare treat, basically just a few times a year. Sure, I'd LIKE to eat them more often but I can't pretend these should be a staple in my generally quite healthy diet. Having said that the ingredient list is happily short: white corn, yellow corn, vegetable oil (contains soybean, cottonseed and/or sunflower oil), salt, trace of lime. The sodium is 120mg (5% Daily Value) per 1 oz and as is typical of such products, the claim is there's 11 (1 oz) servings in the bag. They have a delightful crunch and perfect flavoring.

"My six year old niece love all the Disney characters so she didn't hesitate to grab this Lonnie, daughter of Mulan, doll.  The child really likes the colorful outfit along with all the girly accessories such as earrings, bracelet, high heel shoes, comb, and a purse locket with flower sticker inside. Doll can be placed into different fashionable poses with the movable head, wrists, elbows, and knees.  My niece and her pals had lots of fun playing with the doll.  Materials and construction are good so the doll should be able to withstand normal wear and tear.  Only drawback is that the kids want to buy all the other ""Descendants"" characters too.

"Lutein is found in many dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, and collard greens, etc., and is good for maintaining good vision and prevent macular degeneration.  The macula is a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.  Lutein accumulates more in the peripheral areas of the retina while zeaxanthin accumulates more in the macula region.  Both lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to have anti-oxidative properties and protect the retina/macula from harmful blue light.  My family and I try to maintain a well balanced nutrition but it's helpful to supplement regular leafy green vegetable intake with Lutein supplements.What's good about Eye Guard Lutein:*Each softgel contains a generous 40mg of lutein and 1600mcg of zeaxanthin.*My family's eyes tend to be less strained and our annual eye exams indicate no vision health problems.What's questionable about Lutein supplements in general:*40mg of lutein but how much of it is free lutein?  The amount of free lutein absorbed by the retina/macula is unknown.*We've taken other brands of 20mg lutein supplements since 2010 but 40mg doesn't provide any noticeable difference in vision.*There's no DV or Daily (recommended) Value for lutein or zeaxanthin.  Possible side effects with excessive lutein intake.*Each geltab contains mostly safflower oil and the softgel ingredients of gelatin, vegetable glycerin, yellow beeswax.Overall:Taking lutein geltab supplements is helpful but it's more important to maintain a balanced, healthy diet with plenty of leafy green vegetables, wear blue light blocking sunglasses, and don't overstrain one's eyes, etc., to maintain good vision and retinal/macular health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3228L73ZNSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8XI0M#wasThisHelpful","R3L3228L73ZNSB","A1TR1R2QKWRSRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR1R2QKWRSRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I still dock it one star for the flawed 2 in 1 connector, which I do not endorse.This product seemed like a good idea. I love the 2nd mini USB charger. But for this iPhone owner this charger doesn't cut the mustard. It has a little insert in the lightening cable which when removed, reveals a 2nd connector, which is a kind of mini USB, although not one I need. The problem is, that 2nd connector kept popping out, which was annoying but not a deal breaker. That is, until the lightening charger started to charge only intermittently. Now it's constantly giving me that charging sound when it reconnects, because it's constantly stopping charging! Sorry guys, I'm going back to my trusty old car charger.Note: whiles this company did replace my messed up 2 in one cable, the charger itself is now falling apart. With just the normal wear and tear of pushing it into the lighter, and pulling it out, the unit has fallen apart and I have spent way too much time trying to fit the pieces back together. I'm giving up completely on this unit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233YCSEIC8MGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H0OC91M#wasThisHelpful","R233YCSEIC8MGS","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 3rd Epson printer. In fact the last printer I bought was the previous model, the 620, which is still in service but having paper handling issues. The 630 is very much like the 620; in fact the only discernible difference is there's now a flexible spring loaded ""handle"" to pull the main paper tray out. But in every other way, this machine seems exactly like 620. As there are still 620s out there for sale at about $50 less than the 630, I would look at those before purchasing one of these units. Also, the 620 uses the 273 (and larger 273xl) black ink which has fallen in price, whereas the 630 uses a new black cartridge which is listing for higher.These little Epsons do a good job printing home office jobs. They are relatively fast and do double sided printing, a feature I've grown to really appreciate. Wifi setup is easy. You just have to type in your network name and password directly into the printer and you're good to go. Maybe it's because I've done it before, but in no time I was printing docs from my iPad and iPhone. The scan app is rather primitive - I wish they would update it. Scanner warm up time is rather slow and so is hi res scan speed. But it gets the job done and does it well. I don't use the scanner all that often so its slow speed is not an issue for me. If you are planning to do a lot of large scan jobs you might consider getting the 830 which has a nifty document feeder.The 630 also does a serviceable job as a copier. Sometimes you have to mess with the contrast level,  but even some of my hastily scribbled pencil music charts come out legibly enough with this very handy feature. I use to have to run into town to make copies for a piano student. No longer!One of the surprising things about my 620 was the quality of the photo prints. This machine does a comparable job. It can print up to 4x6 borderless photos and they look pretty gorgeous. If you use Epson's glossy photo paper you will be amazed by how good these look, although not quite as nice as you'd get if done professionally or from a photo printer.This printer will also print on CDs. Like the special photo tray, it also has its own tray just for CD printing. It has a little app for making the CD design with both picture and text. It's rather limited. but fun to fool around with. FYI:You need to use special printable CDs which are readily available here on Amazon and elsewhere. It's fun and the results look pretty cool.Of course a big con with Epson printers (although I have found it to be true for Canon and Hp,) is the amount of ink these puppies use. Like its predecessor, the 630 requires 5 cartridges, and also uses a lot of ink, especially if you're printing those high quality photos. Ink cartridges are not cheap. I've tried various 3rd party refills, but I have to say it's been hit and miss. In the end, I discovered the genuine article works best. One thing I hate is how when one just cart runs out of ink, the printer won't work until you install a new cartridge. So you have to have replacements on hand just in case. One hint: the Epson will start to tell you the cart is almost empty long before it actually is. Just ignore this message and continue to use them until they truly give up the ghost.Also, Epson often updates both its firmware and software, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing. However I've read the updater also keeps track of other information such as how you use the printer and may even snoop around to see what kind of websites you visit etc. I don't know how people know this. But as it's constantly monitoring cartridge use and is connected to the net via wifi at all times, I can certainly believe that besides sending us updates, Epson may be doing some customer research as well. Does that make it spyware? You be the judge.All in all, I like the 630. It's a nice home office printer that does a lot of things well and has a pretty small footprint to boot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4SWRIAQOGM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU62T2#wasThisHelpful","RH4SWRIAQOGM3","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid surge protects that offers up to 750 joules protection. It is good to use with sensitive electronic equipment, laptops, hard drives, home computers, anything that might be damaged by a spike. On top of that, you get 6 outlets where there were 2. You do have to give up one outlet to install this puppy, so you're really gaining 5 outlets in most cases. I like the sliding covers for each outlet - a nice added safety touch.

"This little device really surprised me. It sounds surprisingly good. But not great.Setting it up as a breeze. It paired instantly with my iPad Air 2. Getting it to pair with my MacPro desktop was a little trickier. After pairing with my iPad it was not discoverable on my computer. I had to turn off Bluetooth on my iPad first. It then saw the device-It thought it was a headset, so I had to go to Bluetooth settings and designate the TP-Link as a music playback device. Then all was well. I then turned Bluetooth back on on my iPad and all was well.After pairing I put on an album I know well, which happened to be Allan Pasqua's underrated trio album, ""Badlands"". It's a nice, well recorded jazz piano trio album that reveals a lot about a playback system. I should say at this point that am a wouldbe (would be if I had the money!) audiophile with a decent entry level system. It's good enough for me to enjoy audiophile recordings such as SACD's and high quality DVD audio. At any rate,  in truth I wasn't expecting much from this device. I went ahead and streamed it from my desktop off of iTunes. I then A/B'd it with the CD version thru the same system. Now it's not really fair to compare an apple lossless file with a CD, but I did anyway and I was amazed by the results. The TP-Link sounded really good. Yes, I could hear the difference, but part of that is I'm using really good connects with the CD player and anyway, CD files carry something like twice the data as an Apple lossless MP4. But it was far closer than I expected it should be. The main difference was the piano sounded a bit pinched and thin on the TP and the dynamics seemed somewhat curtailed. Detail was lost in the cymbals as well- that being said, it was still quite enjoyable to listen to.To make it a little more fair, I then compared the stream to my 7th gen iPod connected to directly to my system, encoded with the exact same file. The result? To tell the truth, I really couldn't tell the difference between the hardwired iPod and the Bluetooth stream off the TP-Link. In a blind fold test my girlfriend tried to fool me and she did.That being said, I listened to more stuff and the streaming quality varies. Last night I listened to some things, including my own mixes, which normally sound pretty good. Everything sounded ""boxy"" and hollow. So sound quality apparently varies. In its defense, it could be the stream was slower that night, but I think my original assessment nay have been prematurely over enthusiastic.I then tried streaming hi def files to my stereo. I played Steely Dan's great sounding ""Two Against Nature"" in 24/96. Oh my God, now that's what I'm talking about! It sounded freaking fantastic. So I have found my use for this thing. Obviously, source material is what it's all about. If you start with something this good, it's going translate well thru the link. Just amazingly good.So, rather than view this as a novelty item and an easy way to mix it up in shuffle mode at a party, in future I will definitely be using it to stream hi def files, until I upgrade my receiver for in that can do that from a memory stick or drive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1JQYX97EMW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPATOEE#wasThisHelpful","R1A1JQYX97EMW8","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"YAL author Mal Peet's first novel for adults succeeds both as a brilliant and snarky critique of the publishing industry and at the same time, a kind of black comedy horror novel.The plot is simple: Children's author Phillip Murdstone has a problem. His sensitive books about teenage boys once sold like hot cakes, but no longer. His agent, the desirable Minerva Cinch tries to persuade Murdstone to write an adult fantasy novel, even giving him a cynical but hysterically accurate outline as to what plot elements and characters must be present to achieve a best seller. As enamored with Minerva as he is and in much need of financial reconstituting, Murdstone simply abhors fantasy novels. Nonetheless, he agrees to give it a go. Dealing with writer's block, he ramps up his already questionable drinking habit and in a strange encounter meets a Greme (a kind of gnome) from another Realm. This Greme with the unlikely name of Pocket Wellfair (fantastic name that,) cuts him a Faustian deal: he'll deliver a ""flaky ledger"" (as he calls fiction,) if Murdstone delivers something else in exchange. Thus begins one of the more enjoyable and refreshing summer reads I can remember in some time.Mal Peet has a gift for colorful language. He effortlessly paints a poetic portrait of the northern England landscape, and goes on to develop a small cast of absurd characters that people Murdstone's little hamlet.  Perhaps his best creation is the character of Pocket. A scribe back home in the Realm, he is relentless in his colorful critiques of our hapless author, decrying his fondness for ""damage"" (alcohol)  and his pathetic need to write ""nobbles."" Has there ever been a more disagreeable muse?  Pocket's a great character with a distinctive voice; almost everything that comes out of his mouth makes me giggle.This book can be read several ways. On the surface, it is one of those fantasy novels in which the ""other world"" breaks into ours. Charles de Lint and Lev Grossman's ""the Magicians"" both come to mind, not so much style-wise, but for their ability to make the other world seem real. Think as well of Neil Gaiman, especially American Gods. We're talking about a sort of small, cobwebbed corner of the library in which fantasy intersects with neo-realism. Peet has found a unique entrance into this magical land, playing with the idea that perhaps this is more a description of the inner landscape of the writer's mind than a real life encounter with another world. He plays it both ways, leaving it open to interpretation, that is, until the wacky librarian sisters see strange things too...The tale which takes place in the ""Realm"", which is the substance of Murdstone/Pocket's novel, is given short shrift. We never meet most of the characters of the novel-they are for the most part mere names which are given at best a two dimensional rendering. Peet makes no bones about his real interest, which clearly is in what's taking place here in our world and inside Murdstone's neurotic brain.In a way, this book is also a glimpse into the creative process a writer goes through when creating worlds. He once said,  ""Writing is a form of licensed madness.""I found The Murdstone Trilogy to be that rarest of things, a genre parody that takes its characters seriously, while at the same time finding something to snort about at nearly every page. In this regard the late Terry Pratchett, a master of this balancing act, comes to mind. But this book gets far darker and creepier than Pratchett ever dared. Like Pratchett, Peet is also a master of creating hysterical set pieces that play out with an absurd logic all their own. But as the novel moves towards its close, it becomes clear that it's not all fun and games.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the rather abrupt ending. Without giving anything away, I feel that the story got away from Peet at the end and I was a little disappointed by the way it resolved. But then, in view of his recent passing, it may be Peet simply ran out of time.Peet's passing saddens me. After reading Murdstone, one wonders what would've come next. It was clear he was more than up to the task of writing adult fiction. I wistfully wonder what other delights he would've had in store for us next had he lived.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6W5EEQYXSBXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763681849#wasThisHelpful","R6W5EEQYXSBXL","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"if you're reading this review, you already know these Keystone shows were the last recordings of Evans, made just weeks before he passed. I've owned the companion set (which contains the late sets) for a number of years, but only just received my copy of this, the 1st sets from that gig. Here we find more of the same excellence, but these early sets are a little more ballad heavy than the late sets, in that the late sets feature expansive, frenetic and often exploratory versions of Nardis, which are great but one has to be in the mood to get thru these 20 minute plus excursions. In contrast, Consecration contains ballads such as  My Foolish Heart, The Evans original Two Lonely People and Letter to Evan, and the delicate tunes, Laurie, Emily and Your Story. These sets really feature Bill's writing, and show just what a good composer he really was.Bill tends to take the uptempo tunes very fast, and while they don't sound rushed, there are times where the tempos seem too bright for the tune. A good example of that is the Theme From Mash. I really liked the way it was recorded on You Must Believe in Spring, where it is relaxed and breathes. Here it's a breathless performance; Bill seems to have so much to say he can barely contain himself.Although the Vanguard sets, recorded around two months earlier sound much better, these sets sound pretty darn good-audio quality is more than enough to get these performances across. The piano might be slightly hot compared to the bass and drums, but it's just a question of taste, and I'd rather it be a bit forward than too far under.After reading Laurie Verchomin's account of the last two years of Evan's life, where she recounts that Evans was trying to stay off heroin and was substituting methadone and unfortunately also ingesting massive doses of cocaine, I have often wondered if the coke affected his tempos. It's as though his brain is on overdrive at times, yet somehow he never misses a note. His playing is as assured as it ever was- the logic of his lines is as natural and organic as a bubbling stream.Perhaps as other reviewers have alluded to, Evans knew on some level these were his last performances and was simply giving it all he had. Whatever the impulse behind these intense performances, this is still Evans at his best and perhaps most potent ever. Most importantly, these sets swing with an intensity and abandon rarely heard from Evans.This set is a must buy for any Evans aficionado. More than a novelty or interesting collectors item, this is essential listening. No Evans collection would be complete without both sets. This is nothing less than a record of a meteoric artist going out in flames across the night sky in a glorious flash of epic brilliance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RRSQWUV4M7V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006HIBI#wasThisHelpful","R2RRSQWUV4M7V5","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Proactive One is a very soothing cream that is light and goes on very nicely. This moisturizer has as its lead ingredient green tea, a known antioxidant used in several moisturizing creams on the market. Besides green tea extract, it also contains iris florentina root as well as macadamia seed oil. It also contains wrinkle reducing retinyl palmitate. So we're off to a good start, that is, until we get to the rest of the list.Besides these few extracts and ingredients I know about, the rest of the ingredients are chemicals. This product contains several petroleum products such as butylene glycol, used both as a solvent and a viscosity decreasing agent. Although found to be benign by researchers, I still don't like using petroleum derived products. Besides butylene glycol, this cream also has PPG-2 methyl ether, which is both a fragrance ingredient and is also used as a solvent. While it has been found safe for use in cosmetics by the NCBI, I question its use in a skin care product. This cream has a host more chemicals, including methylparaben and polyparaben, both of which have been found in breast cancer tissues and also is known to contribute to oxidative stress when skin treated with creams containing this substance is exposed to UVB rays. This can potentially lead to cancer, although the chemicals in and of itself aren't supposed to be carcinogenic.Suffice it to say there are too many chemicals in this product for me to get behind it as a regular skin moisturizer. My girlfriend, after reading the list of ingredients, feels the same way. I tend to go after simpler, more natural products. I realize that some of the chemicals may just be fancier names for completely benign substances, but having researched just a few that I already had heard were somewhat questionable, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this formula, at least not for consumers who looking for a more natural moisturizer.I still give this product three stars because it does a good job keeping my skin moist thru the day, and has a smoothing and soothing effect that my partner really liked. So, if you're not too concerned about the above ingredients, you will be pleased with the results.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1YJVY1X0QWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZH05VUM#wasThisHelpful","R3T1YJVY1X0QWX","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While some reviewers have complained about his fins not being movable from the inside, I find his movable mouth to be quite adequate for making this little guy very expressive. His eyes are very sentient; he's so lifelike he almost looks like he's about to bark.This hand puppet is well constructed from polyester fiber and polyurethane foam and will probably last a very long time.

"I had never heard of CAD before and wasn't sure what to expect when I received these. They are boxed quite minimally. I immediately put them thru the paces, listening to Steely Dan's Two Against Nature, which I consider a reference recording.  It's hard to find something better in terms of balance, sound stage and general audio fidelity. Within a couple of minutes it generally tells me all I need to know about a pair of phones.On the Dan album, these puppies showed their strengths and weaknesses pretty clearly. They certainly had enough punch in the bass, but it wasn't tight as the bass should be on this recording, having instead a somewhat wide and flabby feel. The top end is muted - I don't want to say dull but considering these are rated up to 22khz, I was surprised how much high end detail was missing. This is yet another example of how specs don't necessarily translate into the real world listening experience. In the end, you have to trust your ears.This Dan album has an amazing sense of instrument placement, defined by ambiences that are designed to separate the parts from one another-unfortunately the soundstage was not well defined on these, especially when compared to other admittedly more expensive sets of cans. Just for fun, I put them up against my Sennheiser HD 600s, a favorite amongst audio engineers for their unhyped flatness. As would be expected, they easily crushed the 210s, exaggerating their muddiness in the mids and lack of high end detail and transparency. I know, it isn't fair to compare a $30 set of cans with a $400 pair. But it is interesting to hear the differences.I compared these to the ""classic"" studio monitors which I generally use for tracking, the Sony 7506's. Is it fair to compare a $30 pair of phones to an $80 pair? I think it's useful as both are purposed for studio monitoring. The difference was like night and day. As many studio engineers know, the 7506's are overly pumped, both in the highs and to a certain extent in the low end - they are like ear candy: not particularly accurate, but exciting to listen to (until ear fatigue sets in.) While I would never mix on them (and contrary to one review, I don't know a single engineer who would,) I do like them for tracking. Contrary to one review which stated the two phones sound nearly identical, I beg to differ: The MH210's are a whole other animal - they sound quite dark next to the overly bright Sony's. They are not at all alike! I set them up for a recording client the other day instead of the usual pair of Sony's. He immediately asked to change them out for the Sonys.In terms of comfort, I like these headphones, as they  can easily be used for long periods without fatigue. They are very light and nicely padded on the top. Although light, the build appears to be quite good.In summary, I think these are a good deal for the price, although these would not be my choice for critical listening. I will however use the MH210 for tracking when I need an extra pair of decent monitoring headphones. For that, these are more than up to the task.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33SP5CHG90WVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R209OYE#wasThisHelpful","R33SP5CHG90WVU","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This red dragon arrived today. At first I was a bit concerned when I heard the scratching... It apparently really wanted to get out! I gingerly opened the box, when all of a sudden I felt a wave of heat singe my right hand. I instinctively tried to close the lid but alas, it was too late- the little dragon was now loose in my house! He flew around my living room, snorting fire and smoking- I had to dodge his tail and outstretched claws several times, batting him away from his menacing advances. He was small, maybe only 6 inches high, but very fierce, with a snapping (ie movable) mouth full of sharp teeth and a pointy barbed tail. While he was attacking me, I noticed his right wing had a small hole in it- perhaps he had been in a battle prior to his being dispatched?Anyway, after a while the dragon tired out, and settled on top of my refrigerator. I thought he looked hungry, so I fed him the only thing I could think he might enjoy from my larder, a can of sardines. As he tore with gusto at the little fish, he began to make a sort of purring sound, a thrumming that permeated my house.

"I always thought the best incarnations of Weather Report had a percussionist on board. In fact for most of their existence, the band did have a 5th member. It was only some time after ""Heavy Weather"" that the band started touring as a quartet, with Jaco and Erskine holding down the rhythm section. With the release of ""Night Passage"" they had added Bobby Thompson to the empty percussion chair and went back on the road. This is a live recording of the ""Night Passage"" band recorded in February 1980 at the Michigan Theater.Right out of the gate on the opener, ""8:30,"" the band is rambunctious, on fire and nearly out of control. Stark, biting synth textures collide with a virtual wall of sound-everyone's playing is pumped and the audience is going completely wild. At this point it's more of a theatrical experience than a jazz concert. After the initial controlled chaos subsides, the band gets down to business, which turns out to be playing material almost exclusively from the underrated ""Night Passage"" album. I personally have always had a strong affection for this material. That album felt like a return to form after the controversial and highly produced, Mr Gone. I think of ""Night Passage"" as the last truly solid Weather Report album, and it was the 2nd to last with the ""classic"" lineup, the last being bearing the same title ""Weather Report"" (same as their 1st release.)It's obvious from the outset that the band knows this material well-it's amazing how close the sound is to the record.  Zawinul has his sounds totally dialed in and the nature of the tunes allows for a lot of open blowing. After a nice reading of ""Madagascar"" and Pastorius's beautiful jazz waltz, ""Three Views of a Secret,"" the band really begins to takes off on ""Port of Entry."" Now this is the Weather Report I remember from several live shows I was lucky enough to see:  Muscular playing from Zawinul, pointed, incisive solos by Shorter, beautiful flurries of bongo and color from Thompson; underpinning all of this are Jaco and Erskine, completely locked-It's explosive stuff. After a short and very literal reading of Dream Clock, the group segues into Fast City, one of  Zawinul's best compositions. This is bebop for the 21st century. The band really kicks it into another gear and the results are nothing short of electrifying. Shorter shines here, turning in a very free solo that uses the underlying changes as a springboard to lift the music up into the stratosphere. Fast City is followed by a 9 minute Jaco bass solo: it's the usual mashup of noise, feedback, harmonics and loops that Jaco was prone to in those days. As such, it's a good one. He plays his own tune,  ""Continuum,"" over some tasteful looping which really works. There's a lot of indulgent noodling as well, and just when you think it's over, he puts on a recording of the first movement of Hovaness's ""Mysterious Mountain"" and improvises over it!  It must've been a somewhat spontaneous idea because it's clear he hasn't worked out all the harmony and is sort of winging it. I happen to love that piece and it's cool to discover that Jaco did as well. It's a fascinating, if somewhat raw reading. Oddly missing are the usual solos of Zawinul and Shorter or the duos they usually played in these shows. The band finishes out the set with the feel-good island grooves of Brown Street.So, how is the sound? Truth be told, it's an odd mix, originally done for FM broadcast. I don't think much thought went into creating the soundstage. It sounds like it came off a board mix. The only things that sound anything like stereo are the drums and the audience. Almost everything else, keys, sax and bass are pretty much placed dead center (percussion is panned slightly to the left.) The relative instrument balances are fair, getting somewhat more in focus as the performance progresses. At times Shorter's sax seems too far back and the keys go in and out of sitting in the right place. Generally, the drums sound a bit washed out, (especially the thin sounding cymbals,) and the bass is a little indistinct at times. I'm told this show has been available as a bootleg on torrent sites for many years. Having never heard those files, I have nothing to compare it to, so I don't know how much remastering was done. All I can say is, It sounds pretty good for a bootleg.The liner notes are taken from a review written by a critic for the Michigan Daily-they are interesting if somewhat snarky. The writer seems irritated with the band's performance, complaining that since Weather Report had achieved so much success doing something that was relatively uncompromising, any nod to commercialism such as their halfhearted attempts at adding lights and stage effects (smoke etc,) and Jaco's rock and roll grandstanding were somehow beneath them. Complete Bollocks. The liner notes as printed here have a number of typos and omissions, so much so that the very last sentence of the piece is rendered completely incomprehensible. Considering the content of the review, perhaps that was for the best. That being said, I would've appreciated a more positive assessment of the band written with the perspective of listening to this recording some 35 years later to balance out this review.All in all, I like this live album, despite its shortcomings in sound and presentation. For fans of the Jaco/Erskine lineup, this is a must have. While this release will mostly appeal to hardcore WR fans, as it's a document of the last great tour of one of the most influential bands of the era, it may appeal to a wider audience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLU0UWH6H44C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPOGKPU#wasThisHelpful","RLU0UWH6H44C8","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have bought these combs from a couple of sellers and even though they look like what I used to have, they certainly aren't of the quality they used to be. The teeth of the combs used to be rounded in such a way they didn't scratch my scalp- no longer. I recommend Swisco combs, they are hand shaved (and tortoise shell) and the perfect pocket size. Only down side is they cost about $8. That just makes me keep better track of them. Anyway, they feel good in the hand and on the scalp.Also, on this last order, instead of receiving  the usual 4"" Ace pocket combs I've been getting for many years, I received too banana sized 8.5"" combs! I was able to get a refund thru Amazon as the seller uses the ""fulfillment thru Amazon"" system.

"Among his many musical interests, Kurt Elling has long been an avid interpreter of standards. However in recent years he has focused his attention on more contemporary repertoire and occasional forays into original material, culminating in his stunning masterpiece, â€œThe Man in the Airâ€ and the less successful follow up, ""Nightmoves."" In this superb live recording dedicated to the musical collaboration of John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman we find him once again delving into the Great American Songbook.As any long time Elling fan can attest, the man can swing like crazy and is both a fearless improviser and creative wordsmith, especially when engaging in one of his virtuosic vocalising flights of fancy. Less apparent to the Elling neophyte is his ability to wrap himself around a ballad.  Anyone familiar with the legendary Coltrane /Hartman sessions knows the exploration of the ballad is what that collaboration was all about. (If you donâ€™t have that CD in your collection, stop reading this and buy it now.)  In an unlikely musical partnership,  Coltraneâ€™s modernist and unsentimental tenor sax was the perfect counterpoint to Hartmanâ€™s velvety smooth baritone, creating an instant classic.Elling is no Johnny Hartman, but he is a great interpreter of a ballad in his own right. What he lacks in timbre he more than makes up for in interpretation.  Elling has a literary bent and knows that a singerâ€™s first job is to focus on the meaning of the lyric. Listen to him on ""Lush Life"" â€“ you can hear the bitterness and self-indulgence of that timeless Strayhorn lyric. On ""Dedication"" he is his own man, long past imitation, comfortable and gracefully purring his way through such chestnuts as ""Autumn Serenade"" and ""Over and Over Again."" But Elling fans be forewarned: if youâ€™re looking for vocal pyrotechnics, there is almost no scatting on this album â€“ the songs are the primary focus here.Like the album it is honoring, ""Dedicated to You"" is also a collaborative effort, not so much with tenor sax man Ernie Watts as with Ellingâ€™s long time pianist Lawrence Hobgood. Opting for a string quartet over a larger section, Hobgoodâ€™s string arrangements are the epitome of good taste and refinement. The parts were clearly designed for each voice to mingle with and inspire the group interplay, augmenting but never stepping on the music.  Check out the magnificent strings only accompaniment to ""My One and Only Love"" or the lovely coda to ""You are Too Beautiful."" Hobgood has serious arranging chops.Special mention must be made of Hobgoodâ€™s piano playing. He is a consummate accompanist and a stellar soloist who really deserves wider recognition. He has the musical ideas, lyricism and rhythmic drive to make his solos a constant source of surprise and delight. Elling is one lucky singer. Ernie Watts also turns in some fine performances, particularly on ""Say It (Over and Over)"", where you can hear the spirit of Coltrane informing his solo in some of his more expansive melodic flurries.I heartily recommend this album for Elling fans and non-initiates alike. While I suppose it would make a charming addition to a candlelight dinner, ""Dedicated to You"" is much more than that. It is an album to be savored like fine wine, slowly and with total concentration in order to capture all its subtle notes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P50DSOS1TXL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00280NYVM#wasThisHelpful","R3P50DSOS1TXL6","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tales from the Earth is a collaboration between Cuban born marimba/vibist/pianist Omar Sosa and flautist Mark Weinstein. Both are innovators who have contributed to contemporary Afro-Cuban music and both have cultivated a passion for musical cultures that extend outside of the mainstream.Tales From the Earth came together shortly after the players involved with this project participated in an African-Cuban music Festival in Berlin.  The ensemble had not played together before and there were no charts. Harking from diverse cultural backgrounds including Cuban, Haitian American, Afro-American, African, Polish, Jewish American antecedents, all had one thing in common â€“ a dedication to a profound engagement with African music.What emerged from this session is not so much a collection of songs as a compilation of musical spaces. Much of the music consists of layered drums, bells and shakers, with another layer of tuned percussion such as marimba, balafon and vibraphone riding on top. Free form flutes interspersed with Haitian or African vocals drift through the air above this percolating trance groove.  It is an exotic and attractive aural fragrance that fills the listening environment with sensuous sounds.If one is looking for compositional development and form, this is not the road to travel. However if the listener can simply relax and allow the music to sweep him/her away on a sojourn through steamy jungles, swooping across expansive savannahs and luxuriating in the mist of a hidden waterfall surrounded by primeval ferns, this is a journey he/she will want to take.Occasionally, Weinsten and Sosa reveal their jazz roots, as they delicately walk the tightrope between strict modal and free playing. But the music, no matter how far out the melodic improvisation gets, is always firmly rooted in groove making the proceedings accessible to most listeners, especially to those accustomed to the occasional implementation of â€œoutsideâ€ playing.I found after a while that there was a similarity between tracks that led to a mild case of ear fatigue. While I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to recommend this CD to lovers of atmospheric groove music (that occasionally paints outside the lines,) I think the CD wouldâ€™ve benefitted with from the inclusion of a few actual compositions scattered in with the free jams.The melting pot of influences that are infused into Tales is also reflective of a deeper philosophical consideration of the Diaspora and how it has affected the peoples of many cultures. In that regard there is an underlying theme that pervades this CD that makes it a more profound and emotional statement than first meets the ear.  Also, as scientists have traced the roots of human evolution to the Africa continent, this CD perfectly illustrates the commonality of all races found in the true cradle of civilization.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJ48UZ3NC56X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBL9230#wasThisHelpful","R2VJ48UZ3NC56X","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Watching this DVD was a dÃ©jÃ  vu experience. Then it hit me: I had witnessed this group back in 1987 in San Francisco. What had drawn me was the rare appearance of the great composer and trumpet/flugel horn stylist, Kenny Wheeler. I figured I was in for a night of ECM lyricism. I was wrong. To my young ears, what followed was a cacophony that pinned me to my seat for the next two hours.  It was one of my first live exposures to free jazz.  That was over 20 years ago and it is interesting to revisit that moment of musical history with a deeper perspective.The 1986 Dave Holland Quintet was possibly the last group Holland had assembled that was devoid of a chordal instrument. Just a couple of years later he would add guitarist Kevin Eubanks (yes, the â€œTonight Showâ€ guy and Robinâ€™s brother!) to the mix and put out â€œExtensions,â€ one of the key albums of his mid-career. That release gave him broader exposure, and coupled with a return to a more harmonic approach to composition, eventually catapulted him to his current position of being one of the most acclaimed jazz composers and bandleaders of our time.The Holland band of 1986 was a different story. On this re-release of a 1988 laserdisc, this very capable  group of musicians is put through its paces in this challenging set of post-bop Ornette Coleman-inspired charts.The band charges ahead full force on the opener, Hollandâ€™s own â€œNew One,â€ a 16-minute tour de force. After the initial up-tempo opening line the band almost immediately heads for parts unknown in a brilliant free for all between the three horn players.Soon after the opening shout statement, the front men lay out for a surprisingly lyrical solo by Wheeler. It is amazing to hear Wheeler in this context, playing free and yet retaining his musical identity, the mournful tones of his flugel horn sounding like burnished gold against the solid swing of Smith and Holland.  Hollandâ€™s penchant for modal ostinatos is apparent here; a mesmerizing straight eighth interlude emerges that sets up Robin Eubanks nicely for an extended solo. On a dime, the band abruptly heads back into swing time eliciting a staggeringly creative solo from sax man Steve Coleman.The following Coleman composition â€œVortexâ€ also comes out swinging madly, the band suddenly dropping out for a pensive Holland solo, completely exposed, and outside a pulse. Holland has so much to say and embodies the perfect blend of technique and feeling. Just as Dave brings the focus to a quiet point of sound, the band revs up, underscoring a jaw dropping, frenetic Coleman solo. Coleman has to be one of the foremost practitioners of free jazz, his lines possessing a logic and architecture that makes his soloing hard to resist, even at his most oblique. After a tasty mallet drum solo by Smith, â€œVortex â€œsurprises the listener with a through-composed passage that sounds like a cross between a Latin marching band and a section of Stravinskyâ€™s â€œLâ€™Histoire du Soldatâ€. Wonderful stuff.The set takes a much needed break from the harmolodic inspiration of Ornette with the blues inflected â€World Protection Band.â€ An earthy concoction, this tune brings to mind Terence Blanchardâ€™s sophisticated, urban take on the blues. Robin Eubanks gives a soulful solo over the bluesy changes and Kenny Wheeler finds much to explore with some nice ensemble backing parts to bounce off of.The band picks it up again on â€œHomecomingâ€ a sprightly strut that once again acts as a launch pad for some great group interaction. Coleman really stretches out on this one, laying down his most convincing solo of the set . Here we find Coleman sculpting angular Dolplyesque lines, bravely pushing the melodic envelope to its extreme.The set closes with Colemanâ€™s provocatively titled â€œWight Waits for Weight,â€ a funky straight-eighth groove, forecasting Hollandâ€™s later polyphonic ensemble style.  The tune features a Middle Eastern melodic riff underpinned by Hollandâ€™s rock solid bass line, finding a balance between free playing and modal improvisation.All in all, this DVD is an important document of the development of the Holland Quintet (now a sextet in its latest incarnation), a snapshot of a bandleader in transition.  The video production is clean and transparent, the camera focusing on the right player at the right time with few exceptions.The DTS 5.1 sound is excellent, considering the year it was produced. However, the  transparent PCM stereo format sonically edges out the DTS and is the format I would recommend. If you are a fan of open or free jazz this set is not to be missed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRGMIBG9W5AU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002AT462W#wasThisHelpful","RIRGMIBG9W5AU","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On Lawrence Hobgoodâ€™s third album as a leader we find him in a duo setting with consummate bassist Charlie Haden. Haden is a perfect collaborator for Hobgoodâ€™s piano excursions. Both are accomplished artists whose considerable technical prowess is kept in check by an unerring discipline and an artistic esthetic that leans heavily towards understatement.Hobgood is of course best known as the tasteful accompanist and artistic director for singer extraordinaire Kurt Elling.  Elling has such a commanding presence it is easy to overlook the man at the keyboard who provides the foundation for Ellingâ€™s vocal flights of fancy. Hobgoodâ€™s tasty accompaniments are the glue that makes it all work, night after night.This latest addition to the Hobgood catalogue is a mostly down-tempo affair consisting of a nice balance of standards and originals.  The album starts off with â€œQue Sera Sera,â€ a tune I have never really thought of as a  jazz standard.  It has always conjured up unpleasant memories of a too cheerful Doris Day singing it as though itâ€™s a simple minded childrenâ€™s song, which in a sense it is.  Like Bill Evans who took ditties like â€ Hi Lilly Hi Lilly Hi Loâ€ and  discovered hidden depths beneath their somewhat vacuous veneer, Hobgood  reconsiders the deeper philosophical implications of the lyric and gives the tune a plaintive re-harmonization, yielding an interpretation that is both intellectually probing and emotionally compelling.Having established an introspective mood, Hobgood launches into the medium up-tempo title track, one of several originals that pepper the album. â€œWhile the Heart Dancesâ€ is a smart and sprightly jazz waltz with some nice changes and a gorgeous melody. Hallelujah! A great player who can write a memorable tune!Kurt Elling joins the duo on the third track, for a vocal rendition of  the Haden standard, â€œFirst Song.â€ I hadnâ€™t been  aware there was a lyric for this tune, but Elling milks every ounce of meaning from this serviceable if uninspired lyric. Hobgood, leader on this date modestly leaves the solo duties to the composer who turns in a characteristically unhurried and well-constructed improvisation over the austere chord changes.Sanctuary, a gospel tinged Hobgood original is one of two solo pieces. It flows and meanders around a gospel theme that brings to mind early Keith Jarrett.  Even though the tune wanders far afield harmonically from its gospel vamp, crossing into European harmonic territory, it constantly returns home to its bluesy roots.Chickoree, a composition penned by both Hobgood and Haden is an adventurous little ballad that gives both men plenty of blowing room. Hobgood turns in one of his most inventive solos, occasionally flirting with a double time feel.The album is broken up again with another Elling feature , â€œStairway to the Starsâ€. He sounds absolutely divine on this old chestnut, masterfully drawing out his phrasing through the dreamy refrain.  Another highlight and probably my favorite track on the CD is an original tune entitled â€œLeatherwood.â€ It is a contemporary even eighth note composition performed solo.  This harmonically supple tune brings to mind the writing of west coast jazz pianist Alan Pasqua., whose  gorgeous composition â€œHighway 1â€ was covered on Ellingsâ€™ album, â€œNightmoves.â€ â€œLeatherwoodâ€ is as fine an example of contemporary jazz writing as one is likely to encounter. Itâ€™s also a great vehicle for Hobgood â€˜s prodigious technique. Here he lets loose with fiery 16th note lines that effortlessly spin their way across his finely wrought harmonic structure.Special mention should be made of the recording which was presided over by Ellingâ€™s personal engineer of many years, Ken Chistianson, who takes full advantage of lovingly-restored Steinway D piano residing at Roy O. Disney Hall at CalArts. Hadenâ€™s bass sounds fat and full. It is a very warm live recording, in what the liner notes refer to as â€œtrue stereo.â€What most impresses me about Hobgood is how articulate his playing is. Every musical gesture, from his creative single note lines to his energetic two-handed rhythmic passages, is precise and perfect in its execution. His strengths as a creative line player, mastery of voicings, compositional integrity and subtle rhythmic precision serve to make him a standout. In a world where an ever increasing pool of young players try to steal the limelight with cheap bravado and virtuosity, it is comforting to know that players of the of Hobgood â€˜s caliber are around keeping the art of jazz piano alive and well.TrackList: Que Sera Sera, Whenthe Heart Dances, First Song, Sanctuary, Chickoree, Stairway to the Stars, New Orleans, Why Did I Choose You?,  Leatherwood, Daydream, The Cost of Living","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X0QZ54NLVSYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W2OVUA#wasThisHelpful","R2X0QZ54NLVSYY","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album captures one of those rarest of rare moments in improvised music: the pairing is perfect, the rapport is flawless and perhaps the stars were in perfect alignment as well.  The recording quality magnificent and intimate. Although mostly recorded in Disney Hall in southern California, the sound is very intimate, close miked with just enough hall in the mix to feel the space. Haden's bass is captured perfectly here, sounding fat and full as it should be.The material is a mix of Haden and Taylor originals with a standard thrown in for good measure. The mood is introverted. Taylor, who has prodigious chops yet always tasteful, is particularly restrained here, perhaps in response to Charlie's approach. Haden, who is always restrained, is perhaps the perfect accompanist here, providing a clear foundation for Taylor's sophisticated and at times challenging phrasing. Haden's solos are thoughtful and as always, in service to the tune.It's sad to realize that both these masters are now gone, Haden having passed over over a year ago and Taylor only recently deceased a few weeks ago. We have lost two of our finest practioners of the art of improvisation. Thank God we have this artifact to listen over and over.

"That Stowell has never stopped growing is amply apparent on this release.John Stowell is an Oregon-based jazz guitarist who has been on the scene since the mid 1970s. I first encountered his music while he was touring the west coast back in the 70s in a duo with bassist Dave Friesen. Freisen's visceral, earthy approach to the bass was the perfect counterpoint to Stowell's heady jazz conceptions, which together produced a wonderfully balanced mix of sky and earth. That fruitful collaboration produced one of the finest duo recordings of the 70s: ""Through the Listening Glass"" which is incidentally now available on CD.That Stowell has never stopped growing is amply apparent on this latest release, ""Solitary Tales"" which was recorded in front of a live audience at the home of his guitar maker and engineer, Mike Doolin. ""Tales"" is an intimate affair, comprised of a mix of originals and a few jazz standards performed primarily on nylon string guitar with the occasional use of the electric guitar, which makes for a nice contrast to this largely acoustic set.The general mood of this collection is comfortable and laid back. Much of the opening material is played rubato. Indeed, by the fourth tune I was beginning to hunger for a change of pace, my ears fatiguing in search of a more solid groove.On top of this tendency to play rubato, Stowell's melodic and harmonic concepts are very sophisticated and may prove to be too demanding for casual listeners. That being said, on my second go round, I began to hear more of his ideas as my ears acclimated to his advanced approach. Stowell has Very Big Ears; there is an innate logic to the way he develops his ideas. He is fond of deploying controlled dissonance and seems to enjoy playing with melodic ideas that develop out of unusual intervallic relationships. This penchant for abstraction demands much from the listener but for those who persevere, there is plenty of musical enjoyment to be found.Of particular note is his tender reading of Bill Evans ""Funny Man"" and his adventurous exploration on ""House of Doolin,"" a contemporary original played to great effect on electric guitar. However, it is not until ""Willow,"" a Steve Swallow tune that the album really starts to swing. The CD picks up steam on the following track, ""Fun With Fruit"", an intriguing Stowell composition that squarely lifts the proceedings off the ground. The groove intensifies with ""Behind the Scenes,"" another Stowell chart that brings to mind some of Ralph Towner's thornier compositions. Indeed it almost inevitable to draw comparisons between these two artists as they both play the classical guitar in a jazz setting, drawing from a similar harmonic well for inspiration.Nonetheless I don't find Stowell's playing to be the least bit derivative. Indeed, if this latest offering were any indication, Stowell would appear to be a jazz artist worthy of far more consideration and attention than he has received thus far.The recording is itself is detailed and in focus. Engineer Doolin opts here for a tight upfront sound, revealing the intimate details of Stowell's considerable technique. All the squeaks and string noises are in sharp relief as well, but they are not a distraction and in this reviewer's opinion worth the tradeoff of choosing to close-mike the guitar over a more diffuse room sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9300U7V7B9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OXEPVW#wasThisHelpful","R3E9300U7V7B9I","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a number of Fellini/Rota albums out there, some are attempts at orchestral verisimilitude to the original soundtracks, and others such as Hal Wilmer's Amacord are more adventurous attempts at new arrangements, often employing jazz musicians to expand and extemporize on the melodic themes. Of these, the most successful are unsurprisingly done by Italian jazz musicians, the first being Enrico Piernunnzi's outstanding ""Fellini Jazz"", with no less than Kenny wheeler, Chris Potter, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian in the band. It's a spectacular album that while paying homage to the master, also allows some of the finest jazz musicians on the planet let loose on these tasty pieces. The other album that does justice to this material is Galliano's Nina Rota album, which may be one of best examples of how to be creative with this music while being true to the source material. You can feel the original orchestrations even while condensed to a small group. You can feel the humor and pathos, the street vibe of the Italian canzione tradtions that Rota drew from as well as the strains of Tin Pan Alley. It's all there. It's no wonder that such swinging music would attract jazz musicians to want to play it. The themes are strong, quirky, and at times eerie. This music has haunted me since I first saw Nights of Cabiria. It's interesting, as Galliano seems to have a particular affection for the music of that film, as he keeps coming back to it throughout the album. It's great, because he works in some of the lesser known themes from Cabiria and ingenuously spreads out the music from that film instead of keeping it all together in one suite, serving as a means to stitch together the disparate themes from other films. The result is the  album hangs together as a complete work unto itself.Of course it helps that Galliano is a master musician, and that the accordion is a natural for these poignant themes as well as the more circus-like pastiches. It's a pleasure to hear John Surman on soprano sax and alto clarinet in this somewhat unusual context. Trumpet player Dave Douglas sounds fantastic as well both in the ensemble sections as well as taking some magnificent solos.Since it's almost impossible to get the original soundtracks for these films, the next best thing is to pick up this album (and perhaps Fellini Jazz) to enjoy the timeless music of Nina Rota in the hands of some of the most creative musicians working today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R221Y2QJMX14ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NNJLB8#wasThisHelpful","R221Y2QJMX14ZA","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While this little guy lacks some of the features in its bigger brother, it's quite a little workhorse and delivers a lot of bang for the buck.With the 12fx you get 4 channels with mic pres. Each of those channels has 3 band eq. The eqs are the same as its big brother which offers 6 mic pres. I am somewhat surprised Mackie decided to set the mid eq at 2.5k, which is in my opinion not exactly a mid frequency band. But it is useful for vocals, especially in live settings, and while this mixer can be used for recording,  (it even has a separate out for control room,) it seems primarily designed for live applications. Besides the 4 mic pre channels, the other 8 channels are line in and are grouped 2 per additional channel slider. Great for stereo keyboards or guitars that have been split into stereo thru outboard effects. Note that these line in channels have no Eqs.I found the mic pres to be surprisingly clean and low noise. The same could be said when I put a guitar thru the line in channels. I liked the effects, which far surpassed the Bose L1 in quality. (We were using this unit as a sub mixer into the L1.) there are 12 effects and they provide the kind of meat and potatoes reverbs and slap backs needed. These are really pleasing reverbs so no outboard effects will be needed, at least for vocals.The unit gives you ""tape"" ins and outs using standard rca inputs, so you can conceivable record analog audio directly onto a digital recorder with the right adapters. I am surprised Mackie hasn't dropped these or at least added a usb input for streaming and/or recording digital audio. It's big brother does have the USB connector, so this is just one of the ways they are able to keep the price point down. The other thing that's missing from this unit is an on/off switch. This is one corner I wished they hadn't cut. It just doesn't seem right.All in all, this is a great mixer for the money. It's loaded with features you wouldn't expect from a $100 mixer. It sounds quite clean with a very low noise floor. It compares favorably with the 12fx pro in that department. In fact, it sounded to me as if the mic pres are identical in both units.So, if you don't need streaming audio and a graphic eq, (which the higher priced 12fx pro has,) and you can live with only 4 mic pres as opposed to 6, this unit will work for you. And considering the 12fx is about double the price, it's a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TLOEPZX1LXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND1KHY2#wasThisHelpful","R1TLOEPZX1LXN","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel Goleman has written some important books in the self help genre, perhaps most notably ""Emotional Intelligence"", a title so pithy the phrase has entered the American lexicon. I was curious to see his take on the Dalai Lama, who so embodies many of the qualities Goleman writes about.First of all, to be clear this book is not co-written with the Dali Lama. Besides, the foreword, the Dala Lama does not contribute directly to this book, although Goleman had plenty of one to one time with him.The main thrust of the book is an impassioned plea to start seeing the planet and all its people as one family as opposed to being made up of various nations, states and races all scrambling to take their share of what is perceived to be limited resources. By beginning to practice being empathic towards others, the Dalai Lama says one can develop compassion and begin to trust, thus breaking down the barriers between ""us and them."" He asserts that this can be done in personal relationships as well as on the world stage.Goleman goes on to say the development of empathy in small children is taught through the immediacy of touch and argues that according to some neuroscientists, empathy is even wired into our DNA. the Dalai Lama has always been interested in science and often alludes to scientific research when speaking of the natural human inclination to trust and empathize with others. He makes a strong case that actions motivated by greed and are learned behaviors. The Dalai Lama also makes the point that cultivating a compassionate disposition towards others not only leads to acts of kindness but is actually good for our own health, again using the latest scientific research to back up his claims.The message is simple, but the stories are compelling. Goleman prose is steeped in wisdom and grace. If he seems a little in awe of his subject, well heck, it's the Dalai Lama- who wouldn't be in awe of someone who actually walks his talk? A good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KAS9K94QX2NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394894#wasThisHelpful","R2KAS9K94QX2NC","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a straight forward coffee brewer with some cool features. Setting it up for a first brew was easy. You just clean all the parts-the reusable filter and filter holder along with the carafe in soap and water and away you go. Well, almost. This unit includes a carbon filter for your water and you must soak it for 10 minutes before first use. (The manual states it can be used for 60 brews before needing to be replaced.)Once set up, it's about as easy as as it gets. Fill the water chamber to your desired level, (it has a nice visible water indicator on the side,) set whether you want regular or strong brew, pour the ground coffee into the gold filter (you can optionally use a paper filter, but as the manual warns, not both!) and hit the brew button. That's it. In a few minutes you will have a pretty tasty brew. I used my fancy beans from a local roasters and I have to say it was a strong and satisfying brew with zero unwanted ""machine taste."" It was not quite as subtle, aromatic and revealing of my lighter roast beans flavors as my manual pour over method made from the same beans, but close enough. And if you're going to entertain guests, you'll want a machine like this to make up to 12 cups. I should mention this machine's idea of a cup falls a bit short of 8oz. When measured out, I found the side calibration to register about 1 1/4 cups per 8oz of water. The manual said to use about 1 scoop of ground beans per cup (scoop included,) and after experimenting with a bit more than that, I would say they are about right in their estimation-my coffee was a bit too strong with three scoops for two cups. However, you'll want to play with it on your own to get your brew to align with your own tastes.Pros:1) makes a decent cup of coffee with little effort.2) This machine will allow you to set a timer so you can wake up to fresh coffee. It's easy and intuitive to set this feature up.3) has a self cleaning feature which is very convenient.4) looks good and has a relatively small footprint.5) has warmer control with choice of heat level and timer.Cons:1) The construction seems a bit light and somewhat flimsy; it seems to weigh next to nothing. Time will tell if it holds up.2) cleaning the metal filter is a bit of a drag. But you can use your favorite paper filters instead.3) you have to buy new water filters every so often. (But if you already have a water filter as I do, I wouldn't replace it and instead just not use it at all.4) The unit is very light and perhaps flimsy; it seems to weigh next to nothing. Time will tell if it holds up.All in all, I like this machine. It looks good on my countertop, sporting a brushed stainless steel look (it's real metal, not plastic,) and takes up a lot less counter space than my old grind and brew, (which didn't do nearly as good at its primary task, that of making coffee.) I am quite satisfied with the unit and whenever I need to make coffee for more than one guest, this will be my go to machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Z18M63W6MGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFPEW52#wasThisHelpful","R27Z18M63W6MGK","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a classic of Malian music in the Mande tradition. Just two acoustic steel string guitars and vocals, It is performed live in a small room by two master musicians. It has the relaxed feeling of an informal session because it was recorded in a house as opposed to studio. If the vocals are a bit odd sounding acoustically, it's forgivable as the content is so relaxed and at the same time, mesmerizing and transporting. This is a magical recording that captures the freedom and beauty of this style of music. It meanders and soars. It is the essential sound of Mali. A must buy for anyone interested in the music of Mali.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSVV47WQ1M5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026F2R#wasThisHelpful","RZSVV47WQ1M5A","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a little gem of an album. I discovered it thru a Brazilain jazz forum and I am forever in debt to that anonymous person for their recommendation. Although it states that it is a Gil Golstein/Romero Lubamba recording, Toninho Horta's distinctive guitar and vocals make a strong impression as well. The writing is excellent, especially the Phoenicians which features Golstein's scintillating accordion and Luisa, A Horta tune which has a nice melody and chord structure. Toninho takes a beautiful solo on that tune that he whistles to perfectly. Lovely. It's one of many such unique musical delicacies that grace this wonderful recording. Golsteins piano lines swoop and swirl sending ribbons of sound through the musical landscapes-his phrasing is very much across the bar and very rhythmic, belaying his love for Brazilian music and his solid jazz training. Guest percussionist Alex Acuna lays down some sweet grooves on a few tracks as well. It's refreshing not to have a bass player-the music floats and caresses, yet at the same time is grounded in the strong rhythmic sense that all these players demonstrate with great aplomb. In other words, this music grooves! The ballads are also very nice. I love the first track, a beautiful arrangement of ""My Foolish Heart."" It inspired me to give another standard, ""When I Fall in Love"" a reharm and a similar bossa treatment. When an album inspires you to make your own music, you know it's really special. This is such an album. It will make its way into your heart and your playlist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20W2EBH4JV7TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PEHIFO#wasThisHelpful","R20W2EBH4JV7TV","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Premonition was McCandless's 2nd and sadly, last album on the short lived Windham Hill Jazz label. In a way, it's his most commercial album, but that would be misleading. Although superficially a more traditional fusion record, it never really veers into cliche or smooth jazz territory. The writing is so far superior to anything in that genre, it would be patently fallacious to dismiss it as such.The album does have a more traditional band instrumentation than previous McCandless recordings-with William Kennedy on drums, Gary Brown,  bass, Steve Cardenas on guitar (on some tunes,) and the great Lyle Mays, piano. When you've got a band like that, you know it's going to be anything but conventional! The tunes range from the dreamy Oregon sounding ""Rainland"" to the hard edged fusion of ""Punch."" Whidh I believe to be inspired from Paul's short lived stint playing with keyboard maestro/composer Kit Walker. Perhaps the tune that comes closest to smooth jazz is the opening track, ""Robin"", written for Paul's late wife. (Incidentally, The Oregon tune, ""Round Robin"" was also written for her.) Even though this tune starts out sounding superficially like that genre, the inner lines, tremendous attention to detail and care taken in the arrangement make it far more musically nutritious than anything played on those timid records. if you're a fan of Oregen, you're going to love ""At First Sight"", which sounds like a tune that band would've played. It's some of Paul's best writing ever.Produced by Steve Rodby, this one is a keeper. While it may not be as musically deep as Heresay or All the Mornings Bring, Premonition is an album that often finds its way onto my playlist. It's simply a wonderfully produced album of well written tunes played by some of the best musicians on the west coast. Get it if you can find it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UY0FHT0ESK7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000NIH#wasThisHelpful","R3UY0FHT0ESK7F","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a quality all round chefs knife. From the moment I received it, I noticed the quality-the build of this knife is excellent. The blade is heavy and so sharp it cuts like butter-tried it on a variety of veggies, fruits and meats-I can't imagine this knife finding its match. Although the knife is somewhat larger and heavier than my other comparable Henckel kitchen knives, it has wonderful balance and feels great in the hand. The handle is made of hardwood and not only feels good, it looks fantastic. This is an excellent all round chef's knife and for the money it's a great deal as well.

"This Kelty Sleeping bag states that it is warm all the way down to 6 degrees Farenheit...and I believe it! The uber-warm factor comes from its unique approach of using duck down near the shell and polyester on the inside. (Label states it is 25%duck down and 75% polyester fill.) It is cushy and as my girlfriend stated, like sleeping on a cloud. This model is 6ft long, plenty long for me and my partner. It is zippable from either the top or bottom and has a mummy style hood that tightens up snugly. According to the label, it's water repellant. I have yet to test that out.There is a certain amount of trade off in getting a bag this luxuriant. Although the label also claims that it is very compressible, it's in a different category from say, my Mountain Hardwear backpacking bag, which compresses so small it can fit in a little pocket at the bottom of my pack. Even compressed, I would have to strap this puppy onto the outside of my pack. No biggie-the label claims it stuffs down to 10.5x18 inches and I can live with that. The 6ft model I have for review weighs in at 4 pounds one oz,, so although it's light by car camping standards, it can't compete with my 2.5 pound bag. Nor should it: it is a whole different animal. And then again, my Mountain Hardwear bag is only rated to a mere 35 degrees.It's interesting that Kelty gives a different temperature rating for men and women. Apparently, women sleep colder than men, and Kelty gives separate ratings for both men and women. While this bag is rated down to 6 degrees for men, it is rated 19 degrees for women, so keep that in mind when shopping.All in all, this is a deluxe bag, extremely comfortable and ideally suited for car camping, but could definitely be used for short backpacking trips where weight isn't critical. It's simply one of the most comfortable bags I've ever had the pleasure of slipping into. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FY3GMBGOBR22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFDRA#wasThisHelpful","R3FY3GMBGOBR22","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always try to use non-chemical cleaning products. I have tried a number of products for dishes, settling on a citrus/plant enzyme powder before trying this gel.  I have now tried this stuff a few times and my feeling is it works at least as well as the Citradish powder I have been using. Everything came out sparkling without residue or waterspots.Seventh Generation Utra Power Plus uses plant enzymes to micro scrub your dishes. It is biodegradable, and has just a slight natural fragrance derived from essential oils and botanical extracts. Note that the 3rd listed ingredient is ppg-19-laureth-7, an anti spotting agent, was given a ""C"" by the Environmental Working Group in their ""Guide to Healthy Cleaning"" database because of possible negative health effects. I tried to look up what these possible ill health effects might be, but couldn't find out anything about it. So I'm not letting that put me off. It's not listed as toxic anywhere else I could find on the web.In summary, I think this is a clean, effective product that will work under most conditions. Note that by Seventh Gen's own admission, it doesn't work very well with hard water. They suggest adding a little vinegar in homes with that situation. I love that this product is basically unscented and will continue to use it as my main dishwashing product.

"I think the ilumi tunable led smart bulb is a very good idea. I like the idea of being able to create just the right mood lighting with an app on my iPhone or iPad. I like the idea of being able to create and save particular shades of light to recall at the touch of a button. And I think it's cool that I can get this thing to respond to music on my devices. Or create an ""experience"" such as simulating a dawn sunrise, a circadian rhythm or a series of on/off and color changes to create the illusion of being home while on vacation.The problem with this potentially great idea is the execution: nothing I tried quite worked as I had hoped it would. While pairing the bulb with my devices was easy enough, I found the interface to be buggy:pros: bringing up the color wheel was fun and changing the colors was quite smooth.(You can also change the amount of white light added to the color in a 2nd inner circle.) Underneath the color wheel is a dimmer bar.Cons: The problem is, the dimmer bar isn't smooth. As I slid my finger along the bar, the bulb barely dimmed. Then, all of a sudden, as I pushed the bar towards the dimmest setting, the bulb suddenly dimmed and abruptly turned off. I so wish the dimmer was smooth because I don't like bright LED light and had a hard time getting it to dim-instead of smoothly transitioning, it jumped around from bright to very dim and then to off. When I did manage to get the bulb to the color and dimmer setting I desired, I tried to save it as a ""scene"". But when I tried to retrieve the setting (or ""scene"",)  the bulb lit up with a shade and dimmer setting that was quite a bit brighter than the one I had saved. When I tried to get the bulb to respond to music, it did change colors, but for the most part, not in a particularly rhythmic or musical way-although in its defense, on occasion the light changed on a strong beat. Fyi: there are no fine tune settings for this particular application, just ""dance"", ""chill,"" "" fire"" and a brightness setting.In summary, I think this smart bulb has tremendous potential, and as the Ilumi people update the firmware and the software, I think it might eventually prove to be a truly exciting product. As it stands, what we have here is a good idea that is still in its developmental stages. If you want something more than a static tunable mood light, this may not be the right choice. In its current state, I would say, with regards to the app at least, it really isn't quite ready for prime time. As the bulb gets smarter and the app improves, this could be one hell of an awesomely cool bulb. I'm giving it three stars because I still think it's pretty cool  as it is and because I can imagine how very cool it could get as it develops.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KP1RN2GPP4QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCGV412#wasThisHelpful","R2KP1RN2GPP4QB","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been moisturizing for quite awhile now. I understand the benefits and as a guy with dry skin it has made all the difference. I generally use the unscented moisturizers my dermatologist recommends. When I ordered this thru Amazon Vine I didn't look to see if it was scented, so it may be up there on the page,( I looked again it is-its described as white almond and orange flowers,) but when I first tried it I wasn't prepared: This moisturizer has a very strong floral scent that reminded me of lavender. But I have to say the scent was far too intense for me to use on a regular basis. In fact, even though I liked the luxurious feel of it on my skin, I will still would probably never use it again. It's a matter of personal taste-I just don't like scented body products of any kind. Now I suppose there may be many people who enjoy a scented moisturizer. If you can get past the scent, this would seem to be a decent product. It's thick, almost like whipped butter. It goes on nicely and has staying power. It really could last 24 hours! I could definitely tell it contains quality ingredients and my skin felt like it just soaked the stuff up, while at the same time it gave me a very ""clean"" feeling.Because of the floral scent, I would think this product is targeting woman. In an age where gender stereotypes are being blown out of the water on a daily basis, I can imagine there might be some men who wouldn't mind the scent. But I would say overall, this is a product designed for the female market. I'm going to give it to my girlfriend and see what she thinks, and if she doesn't like it, it's going to my mom.

"Shauna Martin has written an attractive,beautifully illustrated hardcover book on the subject of using green drinks as a means to cleanse the body of toxins. The book starts with Martin recounting how she used the green drinks to help her recover from her battle with breast cancer.

Each page is devoted to one recipe which is accompanied by a nice photo. The recipe section includes a number of yummy looking salads as well as the drinks. At the beginning of each section, Martin thoughtfully provides a shopping list for all the ingredients you will need for your cleanse.As someone who already starts my day off with a green smoothie (which includes copious amounts of fresh greens), I am glad to have this book. I tend to use the same ingredients over and over and it's nice to see so much variety here. Most of the recipes which are relatively simple, look really great and I'm looking forward to trying them, even before doing the cleanse.

"The inspiration for the title suite of this ambitious album, Love is a Pendulum, comes from a lovely poem by Barbara Sfraga, which is printed on the inside cover. It is a poem that embodies the constantly transformative, evanescent flow of energy that we call love. The five part suite is the centerpiece of the album-Locke takes the first line of each stanza and attempts to capture its essence. Using the language of straight ahead,  post bop, elements of fusion, sophisticated pop inflected ballads and the occasional nod to world music, Locke brings great contrast to his extended compositions, while giving plenty of blowing time to the talented band he has assembled for this project.Locke has long established himself as one of the best vibe players of his generation, crafting a unique and almost instantly identifiable sound on an instrument for which that feat, as any vibes player knows (and I am one!), is particularly challenging. Pianist Robert Rodriguez has a deft touch and delivers a supple responsive accompaniment. His solos are rhythmically intricate while at the same time, completely lyrical. Ricky Rodriguez lays down the bottom on both acoustic and electric bass-his is also a melodic approach; Locke mentions in his liner notes that many of Ricky's tasty lines were so good that he often incorporated them into his writing. The core band is rounded out by Locke's longtime associate, Terreon Gully on drums. Gully deploys a powerful take no prisoners attitude in his playing, never dominating or pushing too hard, yet at the same time laying down some serious grooves, and always supporting the soloists and ensemble sections.There are a number of guest artists involved as well. Standouts include the great Donny McCaslin, a true force of nature on tenor sax (particularly when trading with killer alto player Rosario Giuliani on Love is Perpetual Motion), and rising steel pan master Victor Provost, whose refreshing melodic approach to soloing on the pan is wholly steeped in the jazz tradition. Special mention should be made of the cutting edge vocals of Theo Bleckman, who contributes some soulful vocalise moments, especially notable on Love is a Planchette. He sounds a bit like Bobby McFerrin at times, freely improvising a tapestry of vocal colors.I'm still getting into this album. It will take many listenings to begin to understand a score this complex, just as it takes many years to comprehend the mysteries of the human heart. Joe Locke has made an epic album that attempts to explore those mysteries and succeeds brilliantly, and has delivered what may very well be the best original work of his career. Five well deserved stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IP7GOSVTZY3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUVD6DG#wasThisHelpful","R1IP7GOSVTZY3X","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While his eponymous solo recording, Hubris, still stands head and shoulders above the rest, Beirach has produced a number of solo recordings. There are now at least two solo albums on which Beirach takes classical pieces and extemporizes on them, mixing in a few originals and sometimes a standard or two. Jazz Adagios is another one. Whereas Adagio has a slightly more consistent dreamy quality, this one has a little more variety in tempo and mood. Both are worth getting if you like the more classical side of Richies work. Beirach is a pianist who can really pull off the delicate feat of introducing a classical theme and improvising on it. This is a great sounding recording too, well worth adding to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6E1JU2OE7YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000008ABY#wasThisHelpful","RI6E1JU2OE7YE","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this vacuum cleaner. It's a little workhorse. It was easy to put together, needing only one screw to attach the handle to the rest of the unit. I will say, it took a few tries to get it to line up properly before I could get the screw to catch. After that it was smooth sailing. After charging the unit I got to work and found it effective and fun to use. It's so nice to go cordless and combined with the fact this little unit is so light, I actually found it mildly exhilarating to clean my bare wood floors. The head has a 180 degree turning radius which makes turning around corners a breeze. With the brush turned on, it effectively cleaned my wood floors. It also did a good job on my rugs and carpet.I really appreciate the detachable handheld unit. When the crevice tool is attached, it's easy to get to those hard to reach places. It also works well in my car which is a definite added plus.Cleaning out the bagless dirt receptacle wasn't that hard, although there are a couple of parts that must be taken apart to get the job done.  After having to deal with a heavy corded floor canister unit with a bag, I have to say I felt positively liberated using this machine. It's also relatively quiet.As far as battery life goes, this machine is OK but ran out of juice before I finished cleaning my 1500 sq foot home. It was close: I still had a couple of bathrooms and a small bedroom left.  For this reason I am docking the Electrolux one star. Still, considering the price I can highly recommend the Electrolux Ergoapido, but I'm not retiring my Hoover. I still need it for stairs and for ceilings etc, not to mention being corded, it never runs out of juice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HE1I8WGVSQ1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1P3WNE#wasThisHelpful","R1HE1I8WGVSQ1T","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As any fan of Keith Jarrett knows, over the past 40 odd years, there have been many many live solo piano albums. Most have moments of glory and some, like the famous Koln Concert or the less well known but even better Bremen Lausanne discs have longer periods of prolonged ecstatic spontaneous composition. Everyone has their favorite. Yet most of the live solo albums in which Keith played without interruption are uneven at best, while the master inevitably treads musical water until the next wave of inspiration takes over. Considering what he's doing, how could that not be so?For this reason and other considerations, health being one of them, Jarrett changed his approach to the solo concert, improvising shorter pieces with defined beginnings, developmental sections and endings. Rio and Paris/London were fine examples of this new approach.  With Creation, Jarrett takes things one step further, compiling the best of 4 separate concerts into one album. Although some reviewers seem irked by the idea, I personally applaud this innovation. When one considers how shocked purists were over the fact that after he retired from public performance, Glen Gould actually edited his performances from different takes to get what he wanted, it hardly seems like a travesty that an artist of the caliber of Jarrett, who is literally grabbing these pieces out of thin air, would decide to produce an album in this manner. It hardly constitutes musical heresy to do so and the results are startlingly coherent and beautiful.These pieces hang together well-the sequencing must have been difficult, but Jarrett has managed to put together an album full of grace and elegance. The music tends towards the contemplative, and as a longtime fan who is well aware of Mr Jarrett's predilection for playing ""out"" and wandering into contemporary non-harmonic territory at some point during his solo outings, I for one was happy to discover that he stays pretty firmly rooted in the tonal world here, producing a neo-classical hybrid sound that often strays into the harmonic world of the romantic period. (There is however, one piece that borders on atonality, but the logic of it is so fierce and confident that it never descends into chaos.)One caveat: if you're looking for Keith's jazz/groove side to emerge, this is not the album for you: Not a repeating ostinato or blues lick to be found here.Two other items of note: there is no applause on this recording, which I consider a big plus. Secondly, while Keith isn't vocalizing all over the place as he sometimes does, there are moments where he does so.  For some reason, his vocalizations are louder than usual here, but thank goodness, very infrequent.There's a purity evidenced in these pieces; it's as though over the many decades of taking on the monumental challenge of literally making something out of nothing on the concert stage, Jarrett has had all his excesses boiled away, leaving only the essence of his creative force. That is what this album represents to me-the essence of a particular driving creative force peculiar to his solo concerts that this master musician has been striving to bring to light these many years. It is in this listener's opinion, a profound step in Jarrett's evolution as a solo concert improviser.As a last note of recommendation, I played this album for my girlfriend who isn't really that into Jarrett. She played it again right afterwards, and once again after that. I know of no greater praise than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NNHZPHWVQGEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V435UG6#wasThisHelpful","R3NNHZPHWVQGEI","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album has always had a special place in my heart. The first 3:30 of this album comes close to being the purest outpouring of spontaneous composition on record. A friend actually transcribed it! Hats off because it's harmonically deep, as opposed to Jarrett's modal trance playing or his ""out"" stuff. It's a little like listening to a composer like Chopin at one of those legendary after hours salons. A bonafide master at work creating unbelieveably beautiful tone poems out of thin air.The rest of the album has many such moments. Really I always thought this was Jarrett's supreme solo concert, even surpassing Koln in many ways, not to disparage that amazing recording. At any rate, this is a must have for lovers of Keith's solo improvisation work. Certainly one of the top 3, if not the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GVCMGB39937/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000261GX#wasThisHelpful","R34GVCMGB39937","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard of this album but never gave it much thought until I stumbled across it here. Amazon prime had a new copy and was letting it go for $4! Naturally I snapped it up. And it's not just a good example of early Richie-it's great. There's a wonderful consistent mood on this album. It flows from the guitar duos into the flugelhorn duos perfectly. You get to hear some of Beirach's great originals, Broken wing and the lesser known Zal and the dreamy Mavrodaphne. Beirach's penchant for exploring certain standards like Yesterdays and What is this Thing are nicely represented here. I love his interpretation of Black is the Color. He may have been the first to take it in this direction.Also, I have to say the sound of this 1976 release is nothing short of amazing. It was released in 2006. The remastering makes it sound like an ECM recording. I'm not exaggerating. Supposedly recorded in Richie's home studio, it was actually recorded by David Baker and judging from the audio, in a pro studio. It sounds way too good for a home recording.If you can find this at a decent price, I urge any fans of Richie Beirach to pick up a copy of this rare album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PQMXNAUYYS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K0YEJS#wasThisHelpful","R22PQMXNAUYYS8","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quiet little duo album by the great flugelhorn horn master Kenny Wheeler and unknown (to me) pianist Brian Dickenson. Kenny's tunes are treated reverently and Dickenson misses very little in terms of understanding Kennys unique harmonic and melodic world. He also contributes a couple of nice tunes of his own that fit right into the contemplative feel of the album. If you like the lyrical side of Kenny Wheeler, this ones for you.  The pair play in great simpatico-this is a very consistent and inspired duo set by two Canadian masters, one well known and one a well kept secret. Would like to hear more from Mr Dickenson. He's got a nice touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NC0ZHE1K1ZLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025YLOZE#wasThisHelpful","R1NC0ZHE1K1ZLC","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to find words to describe something so unexpectedly fresh and beautiful as this new album by Tigran Hamasyan. It's sort of like when you look out the window at dusk and instead of a modest sunset, there is a strange and mesmerizing glow in the west-you are confronted with one of those rare confluences of light and shadow, cloud and sky where the colors become so intense it makes you realize what a gift it is to simply be alive. Listening to this album today gave me that kind of experience.For those who have been following Tigran's career, it has become clear that his is a unique voice. A trained jazz musician with an encyclopedic knowledge of rhythm (I suspect besides his native land's odd time signatures, he has seriously studied the Indian konecal system,) Tigran has returned more deeply than ever to his Armenian roots to mine the veins of gold hidden in his own cultural heritage. With his knowledge of western classical forms, jazz, progressive rock and electronica, Hamayasan continues to forge a unique musical identity that came to full fruition on his last album, Shadow Theater. Whereas Shadow Theater was a highly produced release with a lot of hype behind it, even a video, the somewhat less extravagantly produced MockRoot dropped without a splash, yet is no less complex and probing, and if anything, even more fearless and fierce than its predecessor. Armenian folk tunes in odd times play bait and switch with wildly explosive fusion episodes, sounding one minute almost like traditional world music and the next like something out of Return to Forever's Romantic Warrior. Women's voices soar over pastoral piano ostinatos, only to break into earthy stuttering grooves that startle the listener out of his reverie. It's Tigrans wonderful sense of compositional development and juxtaposition of disparate elements that take center stage here. There are hardly any extended piano solos, maybe just one or two.Listening to this astounding album for the 3rd time today, other contemporary innovators come to mind-I think of Nguyen Le's groundbreaking adventures, such as combining traditional Vietnamese folk music and modern jazz on ""Tales of Vietnam"" or his wonderful encounter with North Africa on ""Maghreb and Friends"". I think of Chick Corea's early Return To Forever recordings where one could hear the ""Spanish tinge"" mixing it up with the raw power of rock and fusion. I think of Egberto Gismonti's unique brand of classical music and jazz blending with the vibrant sounds of the tribal people of the Amazon Rainforest. I even hear a moment of early Jan Hammer (incidentally also of Eastern European extraction,) on the synths in the epic 12 minute track, ""Out of the Grid."" Tigran draws from everything, Hovhaness to Stravinsky, Zeppelin to Zappa.When I hear this music, I think of all those artists who early in their careers found their voice, and from that point on, were instantly identifiable from as little as just one phrase. At the tender age of 27, Tigran has already achieved that point of self actualization. For one so young this is quite an amazing accomplishment. It will be fascinating to see where he goes next.This album is a sort of miracle- it engages the mind, it touches the heart, and occasionally explodes viscerally to captivate all the senses. It is at once accessible and obtuse, familiar and exotic. Even if your mind can't grasp what time signature the music is in, your body will respond anyway; It already knows this is a kind of soul food it has always needed, but didn't know was missing, a special feast for the senses, one with a distinctly Eastern European flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCTPJ7Q6I980/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QB4MHWI#wasThisHelpful","R2FCTPJ7Q6I980","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tigran is not interested in being the jazz piano prodigy he once appeared to be, as evidence by some of his more recent work. But this, this takes it to another level. He mixes progressive rock, electronica, Armenian folk music, heavy metal, pop, jazz and God knows what else into a heady stew that sounds at times like King Crimson, Frank Zappa, Hovaness, Bartok or even Bjork but really, it's not like anything I've heard before. The production style is more pop than jazz, relying on all the technology in today's studio. The result is totally unique, an album like no other, best heard over a great system or better yet, with headphones.I can't emphasize how wonderful this recording is. It's a kaleidoscopic look into the mind of one of the freshest talents to come along in a long while. I can't recommend it highly enough. It is a trip, one well worth taking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5FGZW07Y7DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9CUMMG#wasThisHelpful","R1G5FGZW07Y7DT","A1XL5L0AQXPCKB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XL5L0AQXPCKB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice French press. It's a contemporary design that I quite like. It's all stainless steel except for the plastic handle and of course, the glass carafe. All in all, it does its job quite well. No complaints about the coffee- it's very good. It makes up to 8 cups-when I'm brewing just for myself I make 4 cups worth for my large mug. It was easy to measure the right amount of coffee and water. It was great the first time! I find it quite easy to clean. The only thing I would say that I'm not crazy about is that Bialetti has their logo in no less than 5 locations on the coffee maker. I get it: it's a contemporary look. But really, the logo sideways on one side of the glass would've been quite sufficient and in this reviewers opinion, more elegant.That's the only con.

The book functions nicely as a very thoughtful executive summary on the past 20 years of study and how small tweaks in mindset and perception can help you accomplish more throughout your day, communicate more efficiently and maintain a healthier, balanced life even through the stresses of modern work environments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JS1Y2LTJI1C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553419633#wasThisHelpful","R1JS1Y2LTJI1C4","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cool thing about the WWE's 'Create' series of wrestling action figures is that each of the sets in the series comes as a full kit with body parts, costumes and accessories that can be swapped among the other wrestling figures in the series.  The Kane 'Superstar Rocker Set' comes with 17 parts including 2 swappable head parts, 2 unique masks, 2 sets of boots etc. In addition customization goes a step further with a sheet of 20+ tattoo decals that can be affixed to Kane's body and armor parts.Sizing of the figure is pretty good at approximately 8"" tall. Facial detailing is better than expected, paintwork is decent and articulation on body points is fairly standard and holds up to rough play from your youngsters. The toy is designed for ages 6 and up and this seems appropriate as there are plenty of small parts that should be kept away from smaller children.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YPL34FKRGE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTRDOD4#wasThisHelpful","R14YPL34FKRGE1","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ice skating Mickey ornament is the perfect size at 3.5"" in height to hang on the tree. The porcelain figure has good weight at near 6 ounces and the hand-painted detailing is done very well except for a couple of small and faint red smudges on the green scarf (not a big deal really). Keep in mind that these Lenox Mickey figures are part of an annual line so if you haven't jumped on board with previous versions this 2015 edition is certainly a great starting point to build up your collection of these classic and very well made ornaments over the years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YASM1TYYK4G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNJL0O#wasThisHelpful","R2YASM1TYYK4G5","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From Euro board/card game designer, Bruno Faidutti, this is a fairly simple and streamlined play experience geared for 3-6 players ages 12 and up. Gameplay is centered around slaying dragons followed by the meat of the experience which is based around negotiating the divvying up of the loot. Determining the division of the spoils is kept under 1 minute through an included sand timer so the each turn is kept relatively fast paced. Game pieces which are mostly cards and fake gem treasure tokens are fine for the most part but just wished the artwork on the cards had a bit more detail. Overall the game was a bit too simplistic for my liking but it's not a terrible experience and makes for a good option when introducing this type of gaming to first timers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26NDA50TF0X3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R26NDA50TF0X3K","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Styling and fit is very good with this pair of casual, cycling sunglasses. The black polycarbonate frames has classic retro vintage styling reminiscent of a pair of Wayfarers. The product is very much a unisex set and looks great on my wider face as well as my SO's narrower facial frame. For cycling or outdoor purposes this product works great in that it blocks out wind from creeping in through the bottom as well as the sides. It has a slightly snuggish grip against the sides of your head but it's never uncomfortable and holds up very well while trail running on tough terrain. The product comes packed in a rugged EVA case with a soft case bag and microfiber cleaning cloth as well (product sample provided for review).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z4SQJBG9U2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010494K1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1Z4SQJBG9U2R","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very effective acne/spot clearing treatment. The 1 ounce of product arrives in a small, dark blue glass bottle. For application dip a q-tip into the bottle (do not shake the vial prior to using) and make sure it touches the bottom of the container in order to pick up the bentonite clay compounds and then dab the solution on the troubled areas of your skin. The solution is very fast acting and best of all it does not overtly dry out my skin. For best results I use this at night just prior to bedtime and I wake up with noticeably reduced spot inflammation where the solution was applied.  The treatment is a bit harshly scented with strong notes of alcohol and cucumber extracts but it's nothing particularly overwhelming or unpleasant. Overall a very nice treatment that efficiently deals with the occasional flare up (product sample provided for review).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8P51KT8RMIRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VZH4JC#wasThisHelpful","R8P51KT8RMIRV","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 'Ghost Pirate' island play set is designed for ages 3-8 and has a decent size of not being so large that it becomes cumbersome to store or too small to quickly lose the interest of your youngsters.  The set has a couple of interactive features by way of a secret entrance compartment and a hidden cannon compartment that gently fires the included 2 pieces of anchor shaped ammo.  The kit also includes a ghost pirate figure with various removable fashion and accessory pieces and a ghost alligator.

The unit utilizes an all metal external casing and the entirety of the drive is water/magnet/xray/shock and temperature proof.

"The conditioner feels great going through your hair. After shampooing a small dab is all you need to work through all your strands. Product packaging suggests leaving the conditioner on your hair for at least 3 minutes for best results. The cream easily rinses out and really leaves a nice, lustrous finish. The product has a sweet, berry fragrance that is not overpowering and dissipates after around a half hour.The formulation of this product is based around marine collagen and pure elastin protein compounds.

"The best thing about this Gecko Active yoga mat backpack is the diversity of options the bag itself offers. Typically I've been using those standard yoga mat bags - the ones that are shaped like long and slender duffle bags. Those types of bags work great for their intended purpose which is to lug around a mat but for other purposes - the shape is a bit off putting and doesn't get use outside of its sole purpose.This particular bag though, is a legit multi tasker.  The bag is basically a sling backpack with 2 adjustable straps on the side that you use to hold your mat in place. The bag is extremely comfortable to use even when its weighed down by gear, a filled water bottle and a 5+ lb mat. If I don't need to lug around a mat I can still put this bag to use as a standard slingpack. Very handy and very useful with its dual functions. The bag itself has excellent construction with heavy duty and waterproof nylon materials.  There are two smaller outer pockets perfectly suited for keys, wallets and other small accessories as well as a water bottle adjustable pocket on the side opposite where your mat is held and a pouch for your phone placed directly on the chest strap. There are 2 larger inner pockets with enough size to hold small towels, toiletries, reading materials or a lightweight change of clothes. Styling is also excellent with a functional and utilitarian design sensibility to it. I have the navy blue version which looks great if you prefer a rugged and masculine look (product sample provided for review).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1GBWNFPJN4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BPZFI#wasThisHelpful","R1J1GBWNFPJN4F","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fairly comprehensive volume that has a dual function as a wild game field guide and fairly ornate cook book of 165 recipes. Be forewarned though the recipes within lean heavily toward the French Continental variety and for the most part are intended to demonstrate the preparation and plating of wild game proteins at its most refined levels. As a Canadian publication, flavor and seasoning are very much in line with influences of the region and recipes reflect this with sauces of wild blueberry, apple cider, etc.Physically the soft-cover edition of the book has a nice look to it with thick, glossy paper and plenty of vivid, full color photography (photos accompany approximately 50% of the recipes). While the book is indeed a 2015 publication the entire volume has a quaint, unintentional retro vibe to it due to the layouts, baroque recipe preparation, photo styling, etc that are very reminiscent of the cookbooks my parents used in the 70s/80s. Overall though a very fine book that elevates the preparation of wild game to near rarefied status.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1QM9ELRXUC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778805166#wasThisHelpful","R3O1QM9ELRXUC4","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The neat thing about this headphone stand is that it still manages to look cool even when it's sitting empty without a pair of headphone resting on it. Constructed from thick and clear acrylic this stand maintains a sleek and slightly avant-garde look to it. Measuring at approximately 5.5 inches cross wise -  the stand is just at the right size to keep the phones gently extended without excessively stretching it out.  Weighing in at just over 1 pounds and with 4 rubberized nubs on the base the unit has very good stability and there's no fear of tip over should you happen to inadvertently bump it. Very stylish visual and usage design to keep your cans mounted properly makes this one a winner (product sample provided for review).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2JTC9EKXBOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UE5G8I#wasThisHelpful","R3S2JTC9EKXBOO","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goody's still remains my go-to product when recovering the next morning after a hard night of revelry and merriment. The concoction of Acetaminophen (325 mg), Asprin (500 mg) and caffeine (65 mgs) coupled with the fast action of powder vs. pills is like a jump start on my system. If  you've never tried powdered pain relievers you'll be surprised at how quickly the recovery effects kick in and for me at least, Goody's always delivers when I need it. This particular 'mixed fruit blast' flavor isn't so bad. There is a bit of that artificial sweetener flavor on the aftertaste but the pronounced berry taste does indeed make the dose go down more smoothly in comparison to their non flavored powder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZOHPPVUR2ZVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEMPHH0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZOHPPVUR2ZVC","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall a good, minimalist laptop attache case styled for those who appreciate low profile design without a lot of unnecessary pockets and attachments getting in the way. The interior of the bag contains 2 padded compartments - one for a laptop up to 15.6"" in size (it securely holds my 13"" MacBook Air just fine) and a 10"" tablet computer pocket. Unfortunately because i use a thick, padded case on my iPad I was unable to fit it into said pocket unless I removed the case. On the front exterior are 2 smallish, diagonal zipped pockets that have enough space to tuck in a phone, wallet, keys, etc. On the back exterior you'll find a luggage strap that allows the bag to be secured to the handle of a rolling piece of luggage.The bag has good structure and even when left empty maintains its shape well. Looks wise this is a bag that doesn't really stand out. The compact profile is the most attractive element but on closer inspection little details reveal themselves including the nuanced styling of the heathered fabric and the small pop of color from the yellow Case Logic logo. Because the bag goes for a flat and slim profile you won't be able to slip an excessive amount of goods into it. If all you need to lug is a laptop, tablet, some documents, a book/mag and some personal accessories then you'll be perfectly fine with this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLI7C4QTC86AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LDW2E4#wasThisHelpful","RLI7C4QTC86AB","A3M6TSEV71537G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6TSEV71537G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an eye gel product and serves as a primer for your skin before applying another product (eg - eye cream). The way this product works is after applying a small dab of gel to the desired area there is a noticeable skin tightening sensation followed by anti-inflammatory, puffiness reduction. The product works great around the eye area for those suffering the symptoms of a less than stellar night of sleep as well as those looking to tone down the appearance of wrinkling. What you're getting is .5 ounces of product in a small and compact pump dispensed bottle. 2 droplets is all I need to cover up most of the needed spots on my face.

"I've been doing the salad jar thing for almost 6 months now and this Aladdin faux Mason jar container is going to be my go to vessel going forward. First off I really like the styling - while all components are plastic (BPA free) the jar itself really looks like a glass product and I appreciate the embossed designs on the jar giving the whole thing a classic retro vibe. The vessel itself is nicely sized at 34 ounces which gives you a lot of leeway in really filling it up. The mouth is wide enough to plunge your fork into with no problems for those of us who like to eat straight out of the jar.  There is also a 4 ounce dressing container that screws onto the bottom of the jar lid and even this separate container is leak proof so that if your jar tips over in your bag the dressing will not release into the salad. The fact that all components are dishwasher safe makes cleanup a no muss, no fuss proposition.

"There is just a very slight learning curve to get up to speed with this food thermometer - somewhere around 5 minutes with the printed out instruction sheet in tow. Once you've acclimated yourself with the basics the device doesn't seem so difficult - there are 3 buttons on the front and 2 analog switches in the back and through that interface you'll be able to do a variety of things ranging from setup of quick temperature settings, countdown timers, switching from F/C, etc.The device is well designed for use in the home kitchen. The back has 2 strong magnets that will keep it affixed to metal or a flip out counter top stand to keep is positioned nearby. The thermometer probe utilizes stainless steel construction with steel mesh used on the cabling which makes it plenty durable when letting it sit in a pot of boiling liquid or very hot meat. The wire cabling can withstand oven temps up to 482F.

"For a compact travel shaver this is a fairly robust device that is extremely easy to pack and carry along. The device uses 2x AA batteries and is rated at 30 shaves (3 minutes per shave) per set of full cells. If you're bringing this along for travel the usage of batteries is a good thing as it omits the need to bring a charging cord. The unit is rated for use in the shower and the entirety of the unit can be rinsed under running water. The device is very easy to clean with the heads and foil being able to pop on and off quickly.Quality of shave is decent but if you're new to this type of twin blade powered shaving it may take a week or two of regular use for your skin to get accustomed to this type of product. Even with moderate growth (around 3 days) shave action is very smooth. I have yet to experience any tugs or snags but keep in mind that I also apply a thin layer of shave gel while using this. The shave motor also feels fairly powerful for a device powered by 2 AA cells.

This product also has the unique 'Fast Calc' feature which is basically an algorithmic method to determine the probable final heat reading before the thermometer actually measures it.

"A strange young woman goes down to an eerie basement to retrieve ice cream.  She turns on the overhead light which sways menacingly back and forth.  Horror fans will obviously flash back to the famous similar scene from Hitchcock's PSYCHO, one of several nods to the acclaimed Sir Alfred.Korean auteur Park Chan Wook guides the viewer through an often visually impressive film but ultimately a hollow and pretentious film, emotionally void and disengaging.  Actor Wentworth Miller's manipulative script plants an obvious twist evident early on that falls flat by the reveal.Nicole Kidman virtually whispers her lines to the point of incoherence, giving her weakest performance since the disastrous INVASION.  Matthew Goode as the disarming Charlie basically offers a one-note vision of the sociopath.  Mia Wasilowski (sp) barely rises above the Amanda Seyfried/Kristin Stewart school of emotional vapidness.STOKER failed to involve me, nice to look at but nothing to digest.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KYO1EMNS4HEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSN0VZW#wasThisHelpful","R3KYO1EMNS4HEH","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Director Bryan Singer's visionary flair and state of the art CGI helps establish JACK THE GIANT SLAYER as this year's classiest fairy tale reboot.Unlike the souped up world of HANSEL AND GRETEL, JACK's landscape is vintage fairy tale with disgusting and frightening titans, nasty and traitorous humans and honorably noble heroes.  While Nicholas Hoult and Eleanor Tomlinson are appropriately squeaky clean as Jack and Isabelle, they are also quite dull...not so much their acting, but the script gives the best roles to the secondary performers:  Ewan McGregor doing a smart Deppish flair as heroic Elmont; Stanley Tucci's foppish turn as the diabolical Roderick; Ian McShane, Bill Nighy, John Kassir....all get scene stealing moments.

"It's really unfair to compare this movie to THE WIZARD OF OZ, a classic that is incomparable.  While obviously a prequel, Sam Raimi has fashioned what's really a tribute to the original.  On its own, OZ is a engagingly enjoyable fantasy, visually impressive with delightful humor and a great set of characters.  James Franco avoids the Depp/Downey approach and offers a less ostentatious Oz that I found refreshing.  Michelle Williams is a glowing Glenda, a sharp contrast to the wicked pair of Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis, who are delightfully evil.  No one will ever outshine Margaret Hamilton but Kunis holds her own.OZ is big, blustery and overblown but I had a grand time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1AS0XHY27Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7JGDBW#wasThisHelpful","RM1AS0XHY27Z4","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairy tale mutations are becoming  standard fodder for moviemakers these days.  This high budget revision of Hansel and Gretel is a chaotic, gory, often anachronistic story of what happens after the titular heroes take care of their initial witch.H&GWH suffers from inadequate lighting, many scenes virtually indeiscernible.  One has to question the duo's success when they get their butts kicked quite often.Most of the CGI effects are done well and the character of Edward the troll is a fun touch.

"BABY BLUES is a horror movie that is more frightening because the monster is all too real---post partum depression.  As Andrea Yates and Susan Smith have painfully reminded us, this depression is devastating and can turn an ordinary woman into a heartless killing machine.Colleen Porch is absolutely chilling as the young mother of four children whose truck driver husband wants to go for five, not cognizant of the fact his wife is crumbling before his eyes.  What transpires in BABY BLUES is disturbing and hard to watch.  Ridge Canipe is heartbreakingly stunning as Jimmy, the oldest son facing the woman who once was his mother.BABY BLUES is a brave movie but the film loses focus of the real issue and devolves into a crazy mommy stalker movie with a really disappointing ending.  However, one can't deny the visceral impact of BABY BLUES nor ignore the importance of recognizing PPD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQRVZWXFYOV3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019N6PO2#wasThisHelpful","RQRVZWXFYOV3X","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CRUSH explores the oft-used theme of a predatory female terrorizing the popular high school jock.  Methodically paced and apparently predictable, CRUSH pulls a whopper of a 180 and pulls the biggest I GOTCHA in modern horror cinema.The moment before this deception occurred, I told my wife ""I wonder..."" and kaboom, I was right.  That twist did demonstrate the writer's cleverness in working his audience and makes CRUSH a tidy little thriller.  Lucas Till brings a sense of honor to a usually clichÃ© role; Crystal Reed has a disturbing edginess as mousy Bess and Sarah Bol;ger displays both sexiness and naivete in her role of Till's true love.CRUSH manipulates the viewer quite shamelessly and sets a new standard for cinema stalkers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BINM75SLH2GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7F0LHA#wasThisHelpful","R3BINM75SLH2GF","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the beginning, Steven Soderbergh's alleged swan song SIDE EFFECTS is an expose of medical ethics and pharmaceutical abuse.  However, it mutates into a quirky murder mystery that employs lots of twists and deceptions.  Further plot nuances would involve spoilers that other reviews have  already done so, so I'll just discuss my feelings on the film's impact.I enjoyed the movie overall---it held my interest and the acting is competent if unremarkable.  I'm not a huge fan of Jude Law but he comes across convincingly.  Rooney Mara who came on so strong in GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO seems like an upper scale Katie Holmes.  Catherine Zeta Jones who always looks good is somewhat miscast as Mara's first shrink and Channing Tatum has little to do as the hapless murder victim.Soderbergh's penchant for sharp characterization is diminished by tepid pacing and unexpected predictability.  SIDE EFFECTS is an okay but unmemorable experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BASUOUPFOEW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNWWVFG#wasThisHelpful","R2BASUOUPFOEW7","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting premise and a brooding atmosphere are the strengths of NAILBITER, a low budget indie horror flick.Set in the plains of Kansas during a devastating tornado, NAILBITER focuses on a young mother and her three daughters traveling to pick up their father returning from overseas deployment.  The family is caught in the tornado in little bitty Wellville and seek shelter in the storm cellar of a nearby house....not the best decision as they find themselves prisoners of something horrifying.Since the effects aren't quite convincing, the director wisely ""suggests"" their appearance so we never really see the creatures so that is somewhat a letdown.  Performances are efficient if average and the ending rather anti-climactic.  Still there is an inventiveness that makes NAILBITER a notch above the usual fare.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3856L1E1ARYVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN3DUO6#wasThisHelpful","R3856L1E1ARYVM","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Graham pads the frail script with too many Southwestern vistas and painted sunsets offering a static unevenly paced movie that had promise but caves in mid-way with a disappointing flaccid resolution.Alexandra Boylan as tragic Gwen, Lorena York as her devoted BFF Naomi and Christopher Dempsey as pussy-whipped Van are adequate at best but it's Cantu's self-serving vixen that almost validates HOME SWEET HOME.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JR9QLNAE5TYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQK4YA0#wasThisHelpful","R2JR9QLNAE5TYB","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After effectively spooking us with INSIDIOUS, writer/director Scott Stewart turns on the chills with DARK SKIES.We meet a couple in financial upheaval.  Daniel (Josh Hamilton) has recently been laid off from his job; wife Lacey (Keri Russell) is a dangerously honest real estate broker whose sales are dwindling.  They have two sons:  13 year old Sam (Dakota Goya) is entering the porno/dope enticements and 6 year old Jessie (Kadan Rockett), a precocious lad with an active imagination.  A series of weird occurrences plunges this family into a nightmare which ultimately leads them to question their sanity.Fans of THE X-FILES and POLTERGEIST should enjoy this tidy little thriller.  The first half is a little slow but its second half picks up steam and has some tense, frightening segments.  Russell and Hamilton are quite good as the fragile but determined parents.  Goya and Rockett do well as the sons and the ubiquitous J.K. Simmons has a nice brief appearance as a tragic soul who tells the couple what's transpiring.The whole scenario of outside unknown forces deconstructing a family's existence is inherently chilling and DARK SKIES effectively brings this point home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTCWIBOG87EU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYG98#wasThisHelpful","RTCWIBOG87EU3","A3LZGLA88K0LA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LZGLA88K0LA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The New Wave were a folk duo with Reid King and Thom Adreola. They recorded one album in 1967. The album was a masterpiece of orchestrated folk, and featured Van Dyke Parks, as well as session men like Ron Carter and Hal Blaine.What works so well about this album is its subtlety.. These are not the up-front orchestrations of, say, Sgt. Pepper or Love's Forever Changes.  Producer Gene Page keeps the strings and reeds secondary to the wonderful acoustic guitar playing. There are plenty of  garnishes here--listen especially for the vibraphone--but they are kept in spots you really have to listen for. This forces you to listen deeply and adds a depth to the musical appreciation.The album comes twice on thiss CD, mixed in stereo and mono.

There is a version of ""Proud Mary,"" and a long medley from the musical Hair, so big in 1969.What is fascinating about this album is the bigness of the sound.

Sonny Charles has an amazing voice, and the playing is, of course, perfect.Get it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAE7RI46U60T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQKYPO#wasThisHelpful","RJAE7RI46U60T","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful album by Luiz Eca, a Brazilian musician  who was in the band Tamba 3 and Tamba 4.La Nueva Onda del Brazil has songs that are bluesy, but contain many extra parts. The music is constantly running down fascinating side roads and detours. Completely coherent but totally unpredictable  If there is such a beast as progressive Latin  music,  Eca makes it.All of  which makes a fascinating ride--a ride to be taken several times. Your going to need a few listens to absorb Eca's complexities here,  He bates you with his twists and turns and keeps you in with tons of texture---booming drums, amazing backup vocals, strange percussion --keeping your ears alert to catch every sound.Brilliant.

"If you listen to blues blasters like Count Basie or experimenters like Don Ellis, the big band arrangements of Gil Evans will take a lot of getting used to. Evans, more than any of his contemporaries,rejected flash and musical acrobatics in favor of deep, subtle arrangementsThe title of this album, ""The Individualism Of Gil Evans"" is no 1960's marketing device or generic label to sell jazz to the hip. To appreciate Evans, you really have to have high volume to meditate on this quiet music. Listening to him is closer to hearing Mozart than most big band jazz.Evans on this album starts at a low simmer and scarcely gets to a flame. He uses soft volume, and works subtle but complex arrangements that rest within these dynamics and  that you have to listen intently to hear. Check out the soft woodwinds on the title track, or the way the flutes flutter like butterflies on ""Flute Song."" Listen to the fuglehorn and piano on ""Los Vegas Tango.""The amazement with Evans comes long after the first listen, when you have over time absorbed the intricacies he threads into the musical weave. Evans may not be the best first listen, because the depth of the music is so deep in the music.But patience will always reveal rewards, and for an example, I would point to this album, which shows the mastery of The Individualism Of Gil Evans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13HP9MTYW4NCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000476F#wasThisHelpful","R13HP9MTYW4NCU","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allen Toussaint is one of those names you only know if you really know music, and know marginally. His name may be only in even an astute  music collectors subconscious.This is in no way an insult to this master: its only that you can collect albums for your whole life and not realize how many small print credits this man has on the backs of your album covers in the deep recesses of your shelving. Glenn Campbell, Devo, The Meters, LaBelle: chances are right  now I am within five feet of three or more albums Toussaint had a hand in and I don't even know it.His stature as a songwriter, one of the best has been established by other reviewers here, and a Google search will shed light on this musical force, a force in all music, not just that of the big easy.What might not be as easy to learn is why Allen Toussaint didn't record more, or that he doesn't have more well known recordings. This album from 1971 is a perfect example. He of course records some of his own music here, ""Working In The Coal Mine,"" and does fantastic renditions of other people's songs, like ""The Chokin' Kind.""All this is done perfectly in a spare but full style, with piano from Dr. John, amazing horn work, and  equally amazing backing female vocals. This stuff sounds organic--live and without an ounce of studio fat--but still reveals layers in this clean mix of sound each listen.But for me the Money sound is Tousaint's voice. He is not a belter or crooner, but has the exact singing  gift that makes me love the equally brilliant Bill Withers: just like Withers, Toussaint sings with the intimacy of talking, inflecting his voice so economically to the notes that it feels like he is conversing with you directly. He makes great vocals feel so direct but so casual, which makes him all the more genius.\When you don't have a class A voice, understanding that limitation and turning it into an advantage makes you a class A singer. Toussaint's ability in this, and his  second to none writing and arranging skills make this album essential.Sometimes the best is right in your face and you don't see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEIYRTKSS4P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SLYE7Q#wasThisHelpful","R2FEIYRTKSS4P4","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I love my acid rock and free jazz, I have a secret place in my heart for 1960's soft rock--if its well done. While people like Bobby Goldsboro and Gary Pucket were untouched by the decades experimentation, brought by the Beatles, even the most radio friendly bands added elements like classical instruments and jazz spices like vibraphones. The Critter's ""Mr Dyingly Sad,"" is such a song.I was at first let down to find this was not on this compilation, which includes the two albums the band recorded for Enoch Light's Project Three label, also home to the magnificent Free Design.Awake A Dream does have its  share if straight 1960s soft pop, though even these tracks, recorded 1968-69, have more layering and textures than the mid-1960s tracks, such as ""Mr Dyningly Sad.""""I've been wanting to touch her since I can remember,"" is the line that open's the CD, with the track, ""Touch and Go."" A line you might not have heard in 1965 starts a 1968 track from the album, perhaps an indication of new freedom and risk.  The CD hits its stride with the jazzy polyphony of the multi-part ""Cold Sunday Morning,"" you hear this is a band that had the potential to be more than a three minute singles band.As the 1969 material comes in, you start to hear more Hammond Organs, and, slightly heavier guitars, and  sounds associated with emerging FM rock, even sitars and jazz flute, showing this bands ability to push into progressive terrain. By the end of the Cd your hearings a transformed band, with large jazz interludes integrated into the vocal pop.Interesting here is what is not included, the amazing ""Look At The Girls"" by Giant Jelly Bean Copout, which was the Critters preforming under an alias and flying into Brazil '66 airspace.As is, this is really good pop that  dips its toe itself inter interesting spaces, near the end infesting those spaces with..........well, how many feet does a Critter have","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R708WAYG8BUDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ELZNJI#wasThisHelpful","R708WAYG8BUDJ","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In one sense, Bobby Conn's albums don't change much among them. I know because I have made it my job to get them all and listen intently, I have thousands of albums, so for an artist to drawn so much of my precious ear time is no small feet.Conn reminds me of the Beatles: not in the sound of the music, but in the approach to music. He sees all genres and styles as his to use as tools in a toolbox, and spins them all into endless permutations. For Conn, he works from 1970's art rock, pop and glam, and 1980's new wave, These are his muses as the Beatles worked from Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis and English pub tunes and, later, classical music.The Homeland is one of the best of this artist, who can't seem to make even a so so album, never mind an unsatisfactory one. He works recurring lyric themes as well as musical ones: government control, shady characters, sexual duplicity.Conn's decisive advantage over his rock and roll fathers is that he has fifty years of musical lineage to work from, and is dead certain to take advantage of every second of it. A ska tune slices into a heavy guitar riff that is as heavy as Led Zeppelin's ""Heart Breaker."" Electric keyboard pulses that could be from a 1983 Human League album throb through more heavy rock, right before a piano piece that could be Elton John cira 1970.Most modern rockers have the slightest of clues, thinking rock started in 1991 when Nirvana released Nevermind. At least this is the impression given by the digital compression of the stale guitars. Its a McDonald's rock and roll happy meal with a little advisory sticker for the happy prize.Conn will have none of this: sure, the recording is digital, but is so juicy as he packs so many layers into this musicburger-prime rib well done, the modern technology actually adds to the depth.Is Conn a genius: maybe, maybe not, but he is the most brilliant of musical synergists, proving in a world of digital fast food produced in digital cookie cutters, it is still possible to lead, even if no one follows. So possible to do so much better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R5FGK07P97W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000WXDL6#wasThisHelpful","R23R5FGK07P97W","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One test I use for film scores is, does the score work as well on the stereo as it does on screen.In Ali's case, no. I love Ali. I love Ali's story. I even love watching Michael Mann directing Will Smith playing Ali, and if you are a fan of the champ, see the film.When I did, I heard the Aretha Franklin track, here included, a blues track, which is not included, and some modern R&B which I thought I could at least  enjoy if not love.Ali the soundtrack is dominated by this modern R&B--R Kelly for example; song after song of this material making references to ""the greatest,"" and the ""Champ."" All by artists who probably weren't born during Ali's active years,  and sung in modern digital production, clean as a gauze bandage and as sterile.The 1960's R&B of the Franklin track is strangely out of place on the album, and the modern tracks seem strangely out of place for a film set from 1960-1975. I wonder how many artists singing here really understand the turmoil of the era and why Ali was so important to the times, because if they do,  it doesn't show in the musicI am not saying atmospheric music can't work in a film about this era--it does. And I am not denying my basis against modern R&B in favor of vintage blend. But Ali as film soundtrack gives you little sense of the Ali the film's milieu, and is more cheerleading for ""The Greatest"" then giving you a sense of the story that made him ""The Greatest."" I could turn on any modern FM R&B station to hear music like this, and given the choice between that and this soundtrack, I don't want to do either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXI9MY0ZTU7C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005REU8#wasThisHelpful","RXI9MY0ZTU7C9","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whatever you have to do to get The Johnny Otis Show at Monterey, just do it. This is a fascinating set recorded at that city's jazz festival in 1970.The whole album captures the rollicking, spontaneous  nuance of Otis' stage show. There is son Shuggie-who soon after recorded the classic space cosmic blues Inspiration Information which you should package in the same order as this album-Big Joe Turner, Esther Phillips, Roy Milton, and a cast of class A blues men and blues women.Different musicians, as far as i can tell, come on stage during different parts of the show--a trombone in one part, a new singer, a vibraphone adding jazz elegance where you least expect--and add a party atmosphere to the tight playing core band here.The blues is great, but there is an intimacy to this album that is rare and that really bolts it into the classic ranks. You really get the feeling you are being introduced to Otis' friends at a party that has many guests, but only special people are invited to. It really feels like you are there, and you will forget this is FORTY TWO YEARS AGO, THAT is how immediate this is, and how much we feel that immediacy.Incidentally, if some tracks here sound vaguely familiar, it may be because Clint Eastwood used some footage of this performance in Play Misty For Me (1971). I knew there was something I liked about Clint's movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YQGEQJL4E45S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000293G#wasThisHelpful","R1YQGEQJL4E45S","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Basically, this features the sound of the era--Ventures like guitar, some rockabilly, and some female wordless vocals, and runs bongos through it.The effect is like giving a hyperactive kid a lot of sugar. The bongos drive this already driven music faster.

"The crazy aspect of Sun Ra is NOT that he claimed to be from another planet and based his whole creative persona on this claim. The crazy aspect is that listening to his music, we believe him.In the 1960's, as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman debated whether to use a chord base for free improvisation, and Archie Shepp made free jazz as much about racial politics as about music, Ra used free jazz as complete freedom play. Horns, percussion, the latest in emerging electric keyboards, Ra took the whole ball of wax and created his own space-age musical playground: music was to him child-like discovery where anything could happen at any time and always did. Each album was a brilliant kid's arts and crafts project that sounded fresh each time and completely different from all his others. New born naked.Atlantis is Ra using an early 1960's keyboard that sounds like an electric harpsichord, backed by surprisingly simple percussion lines. Ra improvises, not showing massive technique--though I am sure he had it-but plunking down little figures on his new, jet set of ivories.I love the primitive sound of these early 1960's electronics, creating such a sense of slightly awkward, wonderful mystery. Ra has a new toy, and he is so good, we have as much fun listening to him trying to figure out its use as he does doing so.  Little spurts of notes that seem to work in their disjointedness. Serendipitous musical finger paint. Ra's simplicity here is artistic choice.A lot of reviewers here say this music is out, and on a relative basis, sure, it's out. But Ra's finger stokes here create a fresh, unrepeatable experience. One we should all have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBPFF5AGQNK3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000014KI#wasThisHelpful","RBPFF5AGQNK3H","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Choosing your favorite Keef Hartley Band album may only come down to the type of music you like. Do what I did and start with Time Is Near and you have the band pegged as a more genuine Blood Sweat And Tears, creating brilliant R&B horn rock for the era's progressive FM radio; long after BS&T had gone from being a Al Kooper's brass experiment to a classy hit singles machine for David Clayton Thomas.Halfbreed however, reminds us that like most great bands of his era, Hartley came out of the blues. Halfbreed is a blues album: heart felt and true to the form. Hartly works a live, spacious strain of the blue form, backed by organ, great guitar work, and a live, breathing sound--the genuine strain of the form that both British and American rockers were playing to kids in concert clubs and theaters-this is before concerts moved to arenas--in both Europe and America.The horns are here, but don't play as prominent a role as they did a few years later as Hartley moved into a more complex, soul geared direction. I am not going to tell you witch is better, as the forms are very connected and Hartley mastered both with equally impressive albums. Personally, I like the more ornate compositions that he choose as his career progressed, but that is subjective.Get ALL of this under-known artist's albums, and listen with equal love and intent, and weather you like pearls then diamonds or diamonds then pearls, you'll be happy to have every single Keef Hartley jewel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FV4537TDNHFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015S82BK#wasThisHelpful","R3FV4537TDNHFU","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's 1989. I am at NYU and taking a class on French New Wave filmJean Luc Godard is the first director I learn of, and 1960's Breathless, or A Bout De Souffle. is one of the first movies shown: a great crime thriller about a man-child thief who accidentally kills a policeman and shacks up with an American girl until he can escape to Italy.I not only loved the film but wanted the score, Martial Solal's masterstroke of hipster crime jazz filled with vibraphones and muted trumpets and bongo drums. Jazz based on the blues. All uniquely 1960Even in 1989 Manhattan, it was impossible to get such a score. This was about three or four years before the world got digitally wired, and it became easier to release and buy  obscure material.Well, twenty three years later I look on Amazon, and there it was: The A Bout De Soufflee score on Cd at a reasonable price. And it is everything I remember, bursting off the CD in crackling sound the way it must have sounded recorded in 1960 with a big band and an overhang mike, so very long ago.Like many soundtracks, this one is based around a few thematic lines: some vibraphone jazz lines, other blues, the synergy of the two, and softer romantic themes. All this is based on a big band s sound--lots of warm, passionate brass, with the vibes giving the music the 1960 bachelor pad jazz thread that runs through this scoreIt reminds me of what Ellington and Mingus was doing at the time, and gets an A+ for creating nuance of time, dramatic situation, and place--Paris, 1960.If this sounds even remotely in your town, forget up your ally, you gotta get this while you can","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RGGDFP1T1CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000069LE7#wasThisHelpful","R36RGGDFP1T1CT","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Quiet Village reminds me of a softer edged Zero 7.The band functions on a modernized blend of 1970s mellow instrumental California rock and soul vocals here. There are orchestrations here, extremely tasteful, at times reminding me Bacharach, other times  of Brian Wilson's one off 1960's and 1970s instrumental experiments.But these are given surprise turns, like a guitar break repeating the riff of a song in an diametrically opposed texture. Little surprise aural rabbit holes and hidden caved lurk all over Silent Movie, which manages to combine a dynamic sound you could probably not get in the world of analogue with a warmth you rarely find on modern digital.This is absolutely NOT old ideas given a modern, sterile sound, but a synergy of the best elements of both.MUST HAVE.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBC8BLWOIHI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014I4VAM#wasThisHelpful","RSBC8BLWOIHI3","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adrian Young's Black Dynamite Soundtrack does not quite sound like any 1970's Blaxploitation soundtrack I have heard, and I have heard plenty.But that is a good thing.

Don't be alarmed: you will get all your flutes and wha whas and best of all, great soul vocals on these tracks.

"Michael Legrand must have eaten a sack of sugar before making Brian's song for Bell Records, around 1972.This album is  the type of music you used to hear in TV adds and during technical difficulties in the '70's before cable TV.This is not to belittle the music! Legrand here works a very specific, program music style ubiquitous in those days: very vaguely jazzy, a lot of strings, female background vocals, and Burt Bacharach style trumpet.  Sort of a hipper form of elevator music: if you were born before 1970 you know exactly what I mean, and if you were born after 1975 you most likely have no idea what I mean.Legrand applies this style to tracks like ""Windmill's Of Your Mind,"" the title track, and other popular songs of the era.Legrand had done many soundtracks, including the Steve McQueen, 1968 The Thomas Crown Affair and the brilliant Young Girls ?Of Roachport. Most of these were combination of Euro-pop and elegant jazz, so his right turn here is to me a curious move.Maybe Legrnd had an contract to fill. Maybe he wanted to be more mainstream. Maybe he genuinely felt like experimenting in this style. Who am I to question the motives of a genius, which I wholeheartedly brand Lagrand.And this album does have its up moments of elegance, and is likable as a period piece in the sweeter sections, But there are too many areas where Legrand is playing it safe, where a jazzier approach would have made good music great, and great music brilliant.Still, for its better moments and as a curio--music will NEVER be made this way again, I am glad i got Brian's song, though I'd rather here that of Michel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2631X9RQWGWQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00412WQ1E#wasThisHelpful","R2631X9RQWGWQ9","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If looking at the platform gumshoe of this 9th Creation album makes you guess it is a 1970's funk record, you guess right, funky listener.This came out in the mid 1970s, when funk was just starting to become slicker thanks to 16-track recording, better musicianship, and synthesizers replacing organs and electric pianos..Bubble Gum certainly has its share of mid-tempo ballads, shining with such polish, but when this album gets down, it does so with big helpings of funk jazz. (Think of how Earth Wind And Fire and mid- period Kool And The Gang incorporated jazz,  not how Jimmy Smith incorporated funk.)

"I knew J.J. Johnson through his work with Miles Davis and some of his work on ABC Impulse! such as Proof Positive.I never knew he was capable of composing great, 100% bona-fied soul, such as music on the Willie Dynamite soundtrack""Keep On Keeping On,"" included here, is sung by Martha Reeves, and could compete for the top of the early 1970's charts by any top flight single from Gladys Knight or Aretha Franklin. This soundtrack contains several such numbers.But Johnson's score also includes several Class A jazz interludes, featuring Fender Rhodes piano. and all the trimmings you'd expect from a Blaxploitation sound of the era.'All this talk about Blaxploitation is suspect when it comes to music. The genre title is for film. Willie Dynamite sounds nothing like Superfly or Shaft, but contains music equally fulfilling.

"I wouldn't know a Jerry Goldsmith film score virgin to my ears like I would that of Quincy Jones or Henry Mancinoi. That is to Goldsmiths credit. He, unlike his many peers, didn't have a trademark style, but could write any music to fit any film.Patch Of Blue is a film from 1965, about an African American man (Sidney Potier) who befriends a young girl who is blind (Liz Heartman). Peoples treatment of race and disability are the themes: make Patch Of Blue today and you'd make a different film.Luckily this is a 1965 film, made when film scores worked as albums. Goldsmith choose tender, gossamer melody lines, based on spare uses of strings and piano, jazz flute, and pinches of vibraphone.What works so well about Goldsmiths score is the melodies he uses are simple but extremely distinct, cut like the best jewels, crystal clear.This score does not date a bit, its compositions and arrangements being so tasteful.

"It must have been hard for a vibes player like Gary Burton in 1969. Bobby Hutcherson was doing moving into uncharted free jazz territory, and Roy Ayers was moving funky prime form--his mallets leaving vapor trails.Where did that leave a player like Burton, as talented as his vibe contemporaries but making more conventional, but just as legitimate music.I am really not sure, but I hope he sold a lot of records, because one listen to Throb finds he absolutely deserved to. He here has the fire power of bassist Steve Swallow and guitarist Jerry HahnAmazing raw material, raw material Burton uses however he pleases: a psychedelic opener that could be Pink Floyd with vibes, a violin experiment that could work on Frank Zappa's Hot Rats, blues and trippy ballads.Basically, many experiments taking place in rock are visited on this album. These are jazz guys with jazz chops, but make a ""jazz album"" as of wonderfully unhinged experimentation the way most rock bands of the era were.Burton here does not show the flash of Ayers of the harmonic adventure of Hutch, but that is only because that is not the path Throb rides. Burton is more interested with--I guess literally--chiming  in and decorating his jazz rock psych stew at just the right point. You would probably not know listening he is the leader, and that is to his credit. His ensemble approach here shows incredible restraint and taste. The vibes being such an underused instrument, hearing them inserted in the sweet spot--our musical erogenous zone, our ears G-spot, has amazing impact.But one thing. Admit it.

The Glitterhouse are not really blue-eyed soul, but the baroque organ in this music, the un-candied structures of this pop music, makes it more of an 1960's FM specimen. Yet the band does have fantastic harmonies, and puts their emphasis on uplifting melody,If you never heard this band, who got lost in that huge 60's music shuffle, they are worth the purchase.

"I only have the West Side Story album on vinyl, so I'll review only that.When music is big,, everyone wants to play and profit from it, and in 1961, West Side Story was the big film, winning picture of the year. There were countless artists covering its songs, including Stan Kenton, on West Side Story.Cal Tjader's take of this music is compelling. He covers the tracks, and adds little bridges and interludes that were not part of Leonard Bernstein's film or stage score. There are orchestrations, but these work as flourishes--especially the string swoops, which you should keep an ear out for.Tjader's vibes ring throughout the music, but are never flashy, adding just the right chimes at just the right moment (it takes a long time for a Bobby Hutcherson/Roy Ayers fan like me to adapt to Tjaders minimalist style.) This is not free jazz or funk, so Tjader does not have the open space for big solos.

"Jimmy Smith's 1950's and 1960s albums are walks in the park; walks you should take.Most of the dozens of albums he recorded for Blue Note in this period are easy going blues. Smith used bands that never pushed the tempo of his music, but strolled leisurely through Smith's happy, roll with the tune take on the blues. There was not a lot of variation in the combo structure; sometimes Grant Green would show up on guitar, other times, like here, not.  It was Jimmy's lightening soloing--fast as a '61 Ferrari--that made this music come alive.On Prayer Meetin, he  works again with the great soul jazz sax player Stanley Turrentine. The two never cook, but volley back and fourth, phrasing with each other. It is like two old friends with charismatic voices shooting the breeze, and you could just listen the entire dayNot that Smith did not experiment: get his big band albums like Cat: The Incredible Jimmy Smith (Dig) with Lalo Shiffrin and Bashin with Oliver Nelson.

"If you know Terry Callier's work, you're part of a privileged all too few. His two early 1970's albums, Occasional Rain and What Color Is Love were soul-folk masterpieces; layered orchestral landmarks with Callier's amazingly warm, evocative husky voice. If Cat Steven's were black. he would have sounded like Callier, and been a much better singer than he already was,Callier, inexplicably,  never really caught on in his era, but DJ's collected his albums, and the critic's canned phrase of ""small but rabid following"" was really the truth in Callier's case. He ended up working with artists like Massive Attack and Beth Orton--people who collected all the right records and then hit the big timeIn between the two eras he made this album, Fire And Ice in the later '70s. As disco and soul were taking over radio, Callier's idiosyncratic soul folk must have seemed out of date. He thus made this album with female singers, using more conventional soul. Much of this is very good, as Callier continued to layer his music, dealing with spiritual themes. (Listen to the track here about Martin Luther King.)Callier's voice here is as earnest as ever, and had I not heard is early work, I would probably give this album a higher rating. Callier moved musically, to a place that worked for him on Fire And Ice, and if you are ready for a thoughtful soul album by a talented vocalist, this is just the prescription.Just don't go here expected the novelty of his early work, and don't neglect his two aforementioned masterpieces if you happen to start with Fire And Ice","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166IBP4C4J8Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000056OZI#wasThisHelpful","R166IBP4C4J8Q5","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wonder how much pre-rock and roll music Paul McCartney listened to in his mums polar as a little kid, radio tuned to the beeb. Certainly before Buddy Holly and Elvis were known in the colonies, never mind England, this was the pop music people listened to.You could even tell in the 1960's. Even when the fabs were going all Helter Skelter with long hair and LSD and politics and Apples, Paul was writing songs like ""Honey Pie"" and ""When I'm Sixty Four."" Dancehall ditties that had nothing to do with rock--UNTIL THE BEATLES MADE IT SO! AND SO IT HAS BEEN SINCE.  The Walrus was also listening to Stockhausen and Biero at the same time, and if this does not prove how all-encompassing the fabs were, nothing does. You can even hear the Beatles on demo tapes of Sgt. Pepper, jamming old little pre-rock tunes between takes of rock revolution. All music was at their command.So does it surprise me that McCartney has recorded this album. No. Only that it took him so long. He probably had this in his head his whole life, working with the Beatles, Wings, Firemen. or just fooling with a ukalalie on the Beatles Anthology tapes. It is all music to be owned by the master.Kisses From The Bottom has Paul working with Tommy Lapuma, who was a staff producer way back in the 1960s at A&M, working with, for instance, the Sandpipers, and later, Barbra Streisand and Diane Kroll. He and McCartney here take standards  like ""It's Only A Paper Moon,"" and ""My Valentine,"" and treat them with bass, brushed drums, and piano. You can walk down Bleaker St. in New York and hear standards getting the same treatment. They even do ""The Story Of Love,""--that pop from way back in '67 when Paul and John and George Martin were trying to find that 80,000 kilocycle highnote to end the ""A Day In The Life."" .He probably heard the song at a friend's flat between Hendrix and John Cage and loved itMcCartney and Lapuma are smart to give this track, and all the others, the stripped down treatment that they do on Kisses from The Bottom. Paul was always asking George Martin to give him clean sounds, and the result was making all music rock, and rock able to hold all other music. His voice here is outstanding, as Paul stays in that wonderful low register he does so well, singing to the classy instrumentation with the intimacy of a lover's speech, His voice here is totally unaffected. Why would the master need to do anything else.This is no black bow tie and tails affair. No digital ticket crossover coffee house puddle.  This is a man who can make any music he wants making the kind of music he wants.I am sure right now, Paul is planning a rock album, more electronic projects--maybe getting his fire hat ready-and has fingers in a million more of Admiral Halsey's butter pies. But for now, there is this, and if you are surprised by Kisses At The Bottom, think of Paul's history more, and you won't be.

"I don't know if you would call this music jazz rock, and that really doesn't matter, except to give you an eyelash hint of what this album sounds like. Chuck Mangione sure did not sound like Miles Davis or Mahavishnu Orchestra, contemporaries of this trumpet player in the 1970s.But this music does bare some rock influence: listen the the samba beats and the drive of the bass, which cover the title track of this album. It is not rock, but is informed by the tone colors of popular music which flowed into jazz during this era.Mangione, though, casts a wider net: using a big band, and a large vocal section that at times sound like a church choir. At times you feel you are listening to sacred music, at other times an augmented Blood Sweat And Tears. You never get the experimental edge of Don Ellis or Frank Zappa. But Mangione can't be faulted for this, as it is not what he aims for.His music is nakedly accessible, invoking its era, where jazz and funk and vocal and horn driven forms were merging into endless permutations, if lines ever really existed at all. If so, they never mattered, as they never do.I'll bet money that this stuff gets more respect today than in its era, where lines were drawn between hip and straight. Deservedly so. Horn funk, so present on AM radio and TV adds then has, a lot more artistic credibility now, issued on countless compilations. There are no more long-hairs, no more squares, and serious music people devour and dissect every sound they can get their lasers, or even needles on.Doing so, they will have plenty to put under the microscope here: and in today's digitized focus-grouped musical toilet bowl. what was square then sounds fresh as a daisy, now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V42O8PVS0C2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001F7X#wasThisHelpful","R2V42O8PVS0C2L","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many headphone kids of the 1970;s and 80's listened to the best music of the 60's and 70's, when rock was redefined from dance music to a comprehensive form that could incorporate any other musical form.Bobby Conn is one of the most ambitious of these, and that is evidenced on Llovessongs. ""Free Love"" is track one, starting as soul, breaking into a ska-like jam,, and finishing in gospel rave up. All in three minutes. It sails as well as the best pop, but achieves its huge ambition as well as the best art rock. If this sounds messy on paper, it winds air tight in stereo.Because Conn  does not come to the music: he doesn't have to--he owns it. Just like a sculptor owns his clay and can make you an ashtray or a Statue Of Liberty. Take his cover here of Nilson's ""Without You,"" a  hit we all know, but Conn sings it to a frightening keyboard chime, so spare it could work as the band NEU! or Brian Eno playing classic rock, with  Iggy Pop conducting.He has assimilated his influences so much, he can exude them like sweat of a rock idol, center stage, morphng them into endless permutationsExperimental?--Hardly!

"If Quincy Jones spent the 1960s making dozens of great soundtracks, In the Heat of the Night, just to get your foot in the door, the master spent the early 1970s on on A&M, making albums for Creed Taylor. These took popular songs of their era and made them into great jazz funk.You've Got It Bad Girl is one, and is named for the Stevie Wonder song. Jones cover's it here as an instrumental, and it is a gem of shimmering keyboards. He does the same with a rework of his theme for ""They Call Me Mr. Tibbs,"" and the album also features a full version ""Streetbeater,"" which is better known as the theme for Sanford And Son.What makes Jones' work so brilliant is simply using the best musicians: Ray Brown, George Duke, Chuck Rainey, and Valery Simpson are here. Joens conceptions are brilliant, but when fleshed out by such upper-flight players, they come to their optimum funky light.And if this was not enough: I am always looking for music I here as unlisted samples, and one is a keyboard riff from DJ Shadow/Cut Chemists' The Hard Sell.

If you know Jones' scores of the period, several elements recur: the use of electric flutes, fuzz bass, and amazing use tone color. Ray Brown and Rassan Rolland Kirk were among many musicians Quincy uses on his scores--why the African-American forms sound so genuine.All the jazz, blues, gospel that influenced Jones is here, as are two tracks that should have been soul hit singles, ""Sweet Soul Sister"" sung by Nate Turner, and ""Try Try Try"" by Venetta Fields.I wonder who they were/I also think i spy Chuck Rainy on bass here.

"I got to know Johnny Winter in the 1980's, through his Alligator albums like Guitar Slinger and his late Muddy Waters productions likeHard Again. It was not until much later that I found out he had done a more rockified blues in the 1970's, when people cared less about genres and a wide range of genres could reach the same audience.Saints and Sinners is one of those 1970's album. It has more than its share of blues, even if that blues is in the subtext, sporting more than I IV V changes.

I am slways telling people the uselessness of genre labels, and In The Light reminds me to practice what I preach.And reminds me in the best way: This is orchestral music, full or horns, murky, ambiguous textures, and of course, Keith Jarret's piano, though not in the quantity you may think.Which is just fine, because it is the master pianist who choose this direction, which is perfectly done. This music reminds me of the work of film composer Jerry Fielding, who scored movies such as the 1971 Straw Dogs. Jarret's music is hear is not nearly as dark as Fielding's, but the fluidity of the tone color, the way the instruments seem to meld like wet paint on canvas, is a quality i love, and one In The Light shares with Fielding.Get it and listen repeatedly. It grows on you in its many colors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VR5SB47HZBR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DTEA#wasThisHelpful","R3VR5SB47HZBR0","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melba Moore was in the cast of the musical Hair in the late 1960's/ Since that was such good music--I think she sang ""Black Boys,""- it makes sense she would cover them on her own record.""Easy To Be Hard,"" and ""Aquarius/Let The Sun Shine"" are here, as well as Laura Nyro's ""Time and Love,"" and ""People,"" the Barbara Streisand hit.Some tracks here have a slightly easy listening vibe: not my taste, but its subjective. Moore's voice is so good, so piercing and strong, it works in any arrangement. Listen to the invention on Bobby Hebb's ""Sonny,"" which breaks from a mid-tempo arrangement to a shuffle with the riff of ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" inserted.It works, as does this whole album, whether it is my style of choice or not. If you can get this cheap on vinyl, grab and burn to CD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27P0DICIBUG8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00420OHOO#wasThisHelpful","R27P0DICIBUG8O","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If The Esquires remind you of Curtis' Mayfield's Impressions, that is no mistake. The smooth grooves of 1960's Northern Soul were in stark contrast to the stripped grits of Stax in the south.The Esquires don't have the socio-political content of Mayfield's group, but the lead singers falsetto-as with those of the backing singers--more than hold their own with master Curtis and his Impressions. If you have heard the cheerful soul bounce of the hit, ""Get On Up,"" you will know what The Esquires bring to your soul table--melodic soul with a enough drive to compete with the best grooves, yet enough melody to rank with the best pop.I have heard the full album, and although the band sticks to a basic sound, each track here is as fantastic as the last--you can savor the entire album, which sounds fresh as a 1967  spring outside day with the transistor radio pumping out the best of the hits, and always will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQ9EWBT8R8HN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000008V8#wasThisHelpful","RYQ9EWBT8R8HN","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you picture lapping waves in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night,with small shifts in the light they reflect, this is what this album sounds like.Nurse With Wound are a band I always admire for tearing at the false distinction between sound and music. But relatively, this falls on the music end: the group and Jim O'Rouke create an oscillating, repetitive, thick bed of keyboards, and then insert a constant percussion pattern into it.But this is no minimalist exercise, as the music changes subtly as you hear, and is sneakily fluid throughout. Angry Electric Finger ill grow on you if you don't respond to it right away, but I doubt even that will be a problem","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ETNNZ25ZR9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017GSNDC#wasThisHelpful","R10ETNNZ25ZR9L","A3VZVYWCTGIEV0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZVYWCTGIEV0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DISCO SUCKS! This was the 70's mantra that marked a culture divided by punk and disco, rock and soul, and, unfortunately, black and white. But there are some deep into music, neck deep: if you said ""disco sucks,"" and listened to Hendrix, Jimi's wha wha led you to Funkidelic, and Funkidelic to Cloud Nine, 1969 Temptations, and soon, your shooting off into all areas musical, led by sound, not label or clique.Eventually, you'll land on an album like Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, and discover they were the band that did that hit ""Cherchez Le Femme,"" you heard in the station wagon, way back in '76. But informed by jazz, wha wha rock, Latin jazz, a million digs in the music clay, you'll realize how plugged in this music is to everything you've come to love. The soul of Dr. Buzzards music, the funkiness of Dr Buzzard's music, the Latin flavors that run throughout this elegant, royal purple music.Thousands of albums and thousands light years from those blacklit nights, listening to those fifty or so classic rock albums in your room. Whatever the albums were, wherever you're coming from, its time to put this piece into the whole, connected music piece.

"We have a lot of hardwood floors in our summer cottage and our winter home and we have had our floors refinished in both places during that last two years.  The refinishers told us that ""When the floor is scratched you will notice it immediately because the rest of the floor looks so good.""  Boy were they correct.  I received this product for an honest review, tried it out on the wood block and then went to town on our floors.  We don't have a lot of scratches, but we had a couple of significant ones.  This product performed just like the WearMax company said it would.I also received a block of wood with three scratches on it. (Other reviewers report receiving a similar block of wood) I used some Old English Scratch Remover on the middle scratch and WearMax on the ends ones.  Initially the middle scratch looked great, but after 4 hours of light, the scratch treated with Old English was white again (but not as pronounced as originally) but the two outside scratches were almost gone.To be honest, I placed the piece of wood on the floor with regular ceiling light on it.  I didn't scrutinize it up close say 6-12 inches away.  My only con on this product is that the instructions on the bottle are VERY hard to read.  But we are reviewing the product, not the instructions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BNPR7ZME83W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6U31M8#wasThisHelpful","R30BNPR7ZME83W","AQKU9HP6JXVIK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQKU9HP6JXVIK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Worked out well for our summer cottage.  My husband had fun this past summer experimenting with various foods for appetizers and unusual but tasty entrees.  Our nephew is also a smoker and when he stayed with us, great recipes were swapped.  One of my favorites was small meat appetizers wrapped in bacon and then smoked.  Wow!  Quite a hit.  I wasn't so fond of the meat loaf in a bacon wrap - but I like my meat loaf done in the oven.The unit is sleek and trim and looked good on the back porch (where a lot of people see it).  The first unit came with a dint in the side and the return of that unit and getting a replacement was smooth sailing.  Great customer servicing by Amazon.Caution - it's easy to get carried away with smoking and ""oversmoke"" or dry out the food.  Better to err on the side of undersmoking and finish up in the oven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZ07CZSXH243/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048HU34Y#wasThisHelpful","RNZ07CZSXH243","AQKU9HP6JXVIK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQKU9HP6JXVIK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This spatula is 2 months old and I really wanted to love this item, but................it was in the drawer under our cooktop and when my husband closed the drawer yesterday, the spatula part came off the handle.  The spatula part was thin (which was a plus) and the holes allowed any grease or butter to drip from the cooked/fried item when you took it from the pan.  I checked the handle and found that the spatula had been  spot welded to the handle in two very small places - I mean dots.  So the pressure of the closing drawer simply snapped the welding.

I use this product to make a red raspberry dressing (along with their red raspberry vinegar) that is fabulous and the recipe originally came from the farm.  It's also great spread on sandwiches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HLEGRUEN6VWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M4EE9C#wasThisHelpful","R3HLEGRUEN6VWS","AQKU9HP6JXVIK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQKU9HP6JXVIK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used Melatonin for over ten years.  I found out about it in a discussion with a friend who was going to Australia and she had done a lot of research on the internet.  I started at 3 mg and gradually increased my dosage to 10mg. and was feeling a little flaky, so I decreased my mg. over a long period of time back to 3 mg.  I have found that I just don't need more than that amount/strength for a good night's sleep.  As we age it seems we need help and some sleep aids, I just don't want to become dependent on anything more heavy duty than this product/strength.  I have never had any kind of a ""hangover"" or other morning effects with the 3mg. variety.My husband and I recently discussed sleep habits with two stewardesses who were flying internationally on a regular basis.  They both swore by Melatonin and said that almost all of their friends in the business did the same thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12T6XFN4UNA93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GG6D9A#wasThisHelpful","R12T6XFN4UNA93","AQKU9HP6JXVIK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQKU9HP6JXVIK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Interesting premise for a novel about a small town that isn't what it appears to be on the surface.  I came away from the book with the feeling that Rowling does better with knowing the younger set than the adults.  Probably why her Potter novels are such a hit.Recommend if you want to see the ""other"" side of Rowling (not the Harry Potter Side).  I have to respect her for writing under her own name and for a different type of reader.  She doesn't have to write financially, so it's interesting that she still wants to create.  The story line is somewhat depressing and there are a large number of characters who have a variety of relationships with everyone else.  All of the details/relationships are neatly tied up at the end with some ending in death - not an uplifting conclusion to a novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2YFCPQ59YLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316228583#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2YFCPQ59YLR","AQKU9HP6JXVIK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQKU9HP6JXVIK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great book for a beginning reader.  I read this book with my almost 7 year old grand daughter.  She would read one page and I would read another.  Alternating the pages like this makes reading fun rather than a chore.Two plus comments:  the illustrations are wonderful with a lot of items that we can look for and find (looking at the ""trash"" in the park"").  Then when they learn how to make the wand work (with love and a rhyme) its great to look for items in the actual construction.  The second plus that I really like about the book is the idea that we can create our own words such as Greeneriffic and Emeraldalicious.  There is a lot of creativity in this darling book and it is all very appealing to a 7 year old girlie girl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUQEVTLSRKE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061781266#wasThisHelpful","R1JUQEVTLSRKE4","AQKU9HP6JXVIK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQKU9HP6JXVIK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""When you look this good, who cares if you're plastic!""  BarbieI love this book.  My grand daughter brought this book home from the library and I enjoyed it as much as she did.  It has an excellent introduction about an observant mother who noticed her daughter playing with paper dolls that were dressed up like adults and that got her to thinking about the creation of a plastic doll that would wear high heels, had breasts and legs that went into infinity.  The mother was Ruth Handler, one of the founders of the fledgling toy and novelty company, Mattel.  Handler had an uphill battle to bring Barbie into fruition, but she persevered and the rest is history.The photographs are fantastic and the quotes are even better.  Coco Chanel, Andy Warhol, Marilyn Monroe, Diane Von Furstenberg have some classics and even some by Barbie herself.  Of course Ken is included as an ""Accessory"".  This book is a hoot.  I'm 75 and I still have the Barbie dolls that belonged to my four daughters.

The story spins out of the complications of having to deal with present day estate taxes in England and the historical challenges of the far flung English empire.

Can't find in my local pet store, so had to order online, and price was very reasonable.ADDENDUM: Upon trying to reorder more of these, I noticed on the packages I received, they are ""...Plus MSM & BOSWELLIA"". I notice the package pictured does not list the Boswellia (Boswellia Serrata Extract, 30 mg), so am wondering if the new packages without are deemed better. I read allergic side-effects of the Boswellia could be chest pain, breathing problems, hives/swelling, and/or dermatitis. Although my dogs have not been scratching, one of them had previously had skin issues due to another health issue, but I notice the dryness and bumps are back. I am not listing this as to be alarmed, but just wanted you to be aware of some additives. I will again order these and since the Boswellia is NOT listed or shown on the package, I will be just as pleased to get the package without it. I know the MSM works wonders.

"Great quality flag pole.  Other poles I have had in the past have either rusted out or didn't have the spinning mechanism ball bearings, thus my flag would wrap itself around the pole.  All of the other poles I have had were only 5 feet long where the full-sized flags would be close to the ground.  This pole offers an extra foot so the flag not only clears the house better but also doesn't get caught in the gutters, lying on the roof, etc.  It seems to be well made and being non-painted aluminum, it won't rust and I don't have to worry about any paint flaking off.  If you use grommet flags, it comes with plastic rings for holding the flag.  However, since my flags are sleeved and I use the swivel hook at the tip, I can't comment on how well the grommet rings hold.  Overall, I am quite pleased with the flag pole.  Delivery was prompt and packaging was secure.

Be careful though, as there is only one order to place the cards.  I bought this so my mom could play something that would hopefully keep her mind ""exercised"".

"Looks to be somewhat flimsy but appears to be really made well.  The base is all one piece and the top slips over the rounded lipped area on the base which make a pretty nice seal when not in use.  I found this at my local Toys R Us store and was able to save $20, plus the store sells ""safe"" play sand in 50# bags, so I was able to get everything in one purchase (recommended 200# for this sand box).  The interior play area of the sand box is really much larger than most other sand boxes on the market.  This was bought for my 2 grandsons and there is plenty of room for some of their friends to play in as well.  According to some of the other reviews, this sand box should provide years of fun.

"This tent was perfect for our first camping experience - my husband and I camped plenty as kids but this was the first time taking our 7 year old.  The tent was cozy and perfect for the 3 of us, I think it would be very cramped and crowded trying to fit 3 adults in the tent.  The tent is light-weight and packs small, it doesn't take up much space at all.  It was very easy to assemble and we had it up in almost no time. Using all of the pegs and ropes included it seemed very sturdy and we had no issues at all with a light rain one of the days we were out, I'm not sure how well it would hold up with heavy wind and rain though. Our favorite feature was the stargazing fly - it made our first family camping experience lots of fun.  Overall we're very happy with the tent although I think as our daughter gets older we'll likely want to upgrade to a larger one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S0KWG7P3NUWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6KUR7Y#wasThisHelpful","R1S0KWG7P3NUWB","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This essential oil diffuser is perfect for use in any room in your home, and small and light enough to travel easily. Easy to follow directions indicate how to use the diffuser -plug the cord into the bottom of the unit then using the pre-measured small cup you add water to the center of the diffuser to the 'MAX' line that is marked in bold black print so it's easy to see.  You add 3-5 drops of your favorite essential oil, place the spout on top, and then the green plastic cover on top of that.  A simple push of the button gives you a soft, gentle and quiet mist. A second push of the button gives you a color-changing night light that goes while the diffuser is misting.  A final third push of the button turns everything off.The diffuser cleans easily, and holds enough water to last at least 10 hours. I was pleasantly surprised that a small bottle of lavender essential oil was included in the box with the diffuser, that was a nice little bonus. I really like the looks of it - it has an elegant yet fun design.

The container is easy to manipulate for either a lot or a little mayo, whatever your preference is, and the tip where it comes out remains nice and clean and doesn't leave a big glob of mayo around the lid like you can get with some squeeze bottles.  The wide base on the bottom is nice because it doesn't easily tip over.While the convenience is nice and what my husband prefers, I'm a penny-pincher and this is not the cheapest or most efficient way to enjoy Hellman's.  I prefer to use a knife and an old-fashioned jar so I can scrape out every last bit of mayo before recycling the container.

"The best part for us was assembling this mini crossbow together, the directions are fairly straight-forward and easy to follow, although some of the pictures can be a little hard to follow but it's easy enough to figure out.  I was a little disappointed that it only comes with 5 foam darts, but once we started using it I realized that it doesn't matter because the more you use it the more it falls apart.  Every time you use it another piece comes loose or falls off, so before you've even gotten to the 5th foam dart you have to stop and reassemble some of the pieces to the crossbow.It is compatible with other k-force mini building sets so if you (or your kids) have a good imagination you can combine sets and come up with something even more fun (and hopefully more sturdy). Or if you have other K'Nex pieces you could go crazy and build something totally new and fun. I think the manufacturer's recommended age range of 8-11 years old is pretty accurate.  My 7 year old was able to do some of it on her own, but I had to help with some of it too.  Overall it's a fun toy, but be prepared for some frustration when it falls apart after being used a few times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SBTGXDQ81VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5YA29Y#wasThisHelpful","R35SBTGXDQ81VB","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This air conditioning unit works great for cooling smaller spaces, as far as a bare-bones cheaper air conditioner goes.  There are no fancy bells and whistles here but it gets the job done.  It's hefty for a small unit but was fairly easy to install in our kitchen window - a coordinated strong person could manage it on their own, but I opted to balance the air conditioner while hubby installed the screws.  Expandable side panels help cut down on air leaks but I strongly suggest supplementing around your window with foam panels and inserts as needed to help cut down on wasted energy/air loss.  This isn't the most quiet unit, but in the kitchen I don't mind it.  If you're installing it someplace where you want quiet then you might want to consider investing in a pricier model that will be quieter.  We did find that the more secure you install it, the quieter it is - my husband added some wood wedges at the top of the window to help secure and hold everything in place and the air conditioner was definitely quieter once it that was done, just that extra bit of stabilization made a big difference.The controls are manual and very simple - one dial is your on/off, and you can choose from fan hi/low or cooling hi/low.  I'm a little disappointed that there isn't a 'medium' setting, as there are times that hi seems a bit too cold, and low isn't cold enough.  The other dial is to adjust the thermostat.  The air vent at the top is adjustable for height and direction.Overall it's a good, sturdy unit and it works well for the area we have it in - even when I've been running the oven and dishwasher and warming the kitchen up, the air conditioner does a good job of keeping things very cool when I have it cranked up on high.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TGLVV9G9M9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE1KPS8#wasThisHelpful","R12TGLVV9G9M9U","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to trying many of the recipes in Laura Fuentes new book The Best Homemade Kids' Snacks on the Planet, since we've enjoyed trying many of the recipes from her other book The Best Homemade Kids' Lunches on the Planet. While other reviewers have commented about the fact that the book should not claim to have 'healthy' recipes as it does on the cover because many of the recipes call for things such as white sugar, and white flour - I think the emphasis is making your own home-made versions of things where you can, and choosing healthier options that way rather than opting for store-bought versions that are loaded with preservatives and far more sugar than what some of these recipes call for.  Of course moderation is the key with ANY snacks, for kids of all ages (and adults), and those recipes that call for sugar and flour simply need to be enjoyed less than some of the healthier options.I was a little disappointed that some of the recipes in the book (particularly in the fruit and veggies sections) seemed like no-brainer combinations to me, and aren't really even recipes at all.  An example would be 'Watermelon Pops.'  All it is, is a wedge of watermelon on a popsicle stick.  Does this really merit a spot in a cookbook, that people are paying for?  Hummus and veggies is another - again a common combination that many people already enjoy, don't see the need to include this as a recipe here.  There are a handful of these throughout the book that I was a little annoyed to see, but not enough for me to consider my money poorly spent on the book.Disappointment aside - there are some fun new combinations that I would not have thought of, and was eager to try with my 7 year old.  Some of the recipes we've enjoyed (so far) are the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Dough Bites, the Oh-My-Goodness Party Mix, and Baked Zuchinni Bites.  There have been some that were hit and miss - some I liked and my daughter didn't, and vice versa.  Most of the recipes are incredibly simple and call for everyday common pantry and kitchen ingredients.  There were a few ingredients here and there such as coconut oil, coconut flour and chia seeds - some people might not normally buy these but they were items I already had.Overall we like the book and look forward to trying out one or two new recipes every week - right now we're focusing on frozen treats to keep cool.  If you're in a rut with finding snacks for your little ones I recommend the book - while there may be a few 'dud' recipes, there are a lot in the book and you're sure to find several to your liking, and almost every recipe can be tweaked a bit if it doesn't quite fit your food needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G57VH5Z1KFRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592336612#wasThisHelpful","R2G57VH5Z1KFRP","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had a similar scarf purchased last year from a different manufacturer, for my daughter to use after sporting events games to help her cool down after.  When I pulled it out to use this summer I realized that a small hole had developed in one of the seams and all of the little beads were spilling out, so I didn't hesitate to replace it.  For those of you not familiar with these types of products - the scarf is full of little tiny beads like water beads - when you soak them in water they absorb the water and expand greatly.  Over time the water in the beads evaporates and they shrink again, helping keep you cool as they do so.  Once the beads are wet it takes a long, LONG time for them to completely dry again but they will eventually completely dry and when you are done using it for the season you can put it in a bag and store it.  During the hot weather I keep my scarf wet in a ziplock baggy in the refrigerator (they say you should not put these in the freezer).  When it starts to get a little dry I simply soak it in a bowl of cold water for several minutes, then gently wring out the excess water and we're good to go.  After a few weeks, or if it looks or feels dirty or starts to smell I simply gently wash with some gentle hand or dish soap, and thoroughly rinse it under running water before using it again.For those who have had issues or find that it doesn't work well for them - make sure you soak the scarf in water for a long time, especially the first time.  It takes a long time for those beads to absorb all that water.  Also once it is thoroughly soaked pop it in the fridge for a while before you want to use it, so it's nice and cold.  I keep ours in a cooler with cold drinks and ice packs so my daughter can put it on after her soccer games - it's nice and cold and super refreshing and helps her cool down quickly.  Even when the scarf warms to room temperature the moisture that it leaves against your skin helps to cool you, even if it doesn't feel 'cold' against your skin.These scarfs work well for us - this particular brand is well made and pretty as well, it looks like a regular type of bandanna.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29JMWZ6XEI3SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XX4XI0#wasThisHelpful","R29JMWZ6XEI3SZ","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about this yoga towel set.  It does what it is supposed to do - absorb sweat and wetness with no excessive residual odors from the sweat, but there is room for some improvement.  First of all this does not feel like your typical microfiber sweat-absorbing towel - it does not HAVE the bumpy, looped fibers that you traditionally find in a microfiber product.  These towels are very smooth to the touch, yet they are still ultra-absorbant.  I know this is just in my head, but to me I don't feel like the small towel is wiping the sweat off of my face as well as a traditional towel, because it has that smoother texture, even though I know it is.  Just a little quirk of mine I guess.  The large towel has small non-skid dots all over the bottom of it so you can lay it on your yoga may and it won't slide - this feature works very well and my towel did not slide at all while I was using it.  The bonus of having this is not having to wipe your mat down after, which will help preserve the life of your mat and keep it cleaner longer.Other reviewers have commented that the seams on their towels were loose or sloppy or coming undone -the seams on both of my towels were precise and neat, there were no loose threads or signs of unraveling even after 2 rounds through the laundry.Another issue that many have commented on and may be the decision point for some considering purchasing this item - the main ingredient used in the Ultra Fresh (triclosan) that keeps your towels from smelling is known to be used as a pesticide. It works well when it comes to keeping your towels from getting smelly - I use them at least twice before washing them.  For some this may be a big sticking point, for me it is not considering I normally use the towels only twice a week, and I'm not using them to thoroughly dry down my entire body like I would if I had just showered, but simply to absorb some excessive sweat and protect my mat.  Some people may not want any exposure to this product at all and that's understandable - I'm not thrilled with the fact that it contains triclosan, but I'm ok with the minimal exposure.Another thing to consider is that the triclosan that is in the towels will wash out over time.Overall - they work well and I will use them until they fall apart, but they could be better if they could find something other than triclosan to help maintain freshness and reduce smells.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XCRAO0EV6JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYJWZEO#wasThisHelpful","R32XCRAO0EV6JM","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This outfit is adorable and fits the American Girl brand dolls perfectly.  It's a 3-piece set with an elastic-waist skirt, a velcro-backed top and a cape that snaps onto the back of the shirt.  Overall the outfit seems really well made with the exception of the snaps that attach the cape to the back of the top- they are plastic snaps which are very sturdy however the thread holding the snaps onto the outfit is not and the snaps pulled off of the outfit easily after the 4th time of pulling them apart.  I was able to easily sew the snap pieces back on but was disappointed that these pieces weren't attached more securely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16EIAPH1Q09NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQM3O36#wasThisHelpful","R16EIAPH1Q09NR","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no issues with the packaging - there are 2 small portions packaged together that you can 'snap' in half to serve only one portion at a time which I actually like since I sometimes give my cat a bit of wet food in the middle of the day to tide her over until dinner time.  Each portion has a small foil cover that you pull back, and if you hold the container upside down over a plate or dish the food slides out fairly easily.  There is a small bit of gravy in the container as well so be careful, it can be a little drippy.  The food isn't overly smelly like some fish-based wet cat foods can be.  Unfortunately my cat does not care for this at all - she is getting more finicky in her old age and tends to turn her nose up at pates lately.  She did eat a little of it the first few times I put it down, but you could tell she was doing it grudgingly and only because she was really hungry, not because she really liked the food.  If it's a food she likes she scarfs it down and she didn't even finish this stuff.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJR26J4RTGQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLSAVDI#wasThisHelpful","R3GJR26J4RTGQ3","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been trying for quite some time to find a natural deodorant that isn't loaded with chemicals or minerals, but also helps protect from sweat and odor.  Others I have tried did not cover body odor well enough, or caused my skin to break out.  The first time I tried this I really put it to the test - I went to the gym that day and really worked up a sweat.  I was impressed how well this worked - all during my class I could smell (faintly) the scent of the deodorant which was a nice smell, but it wasn't strong or over-powering.  I was more impressed that I didn't smell any body odor.  Even by the end of the day I can still get a faint scent from under my arm, which tells me the deodorant is still working.  It doesn't block sweat entirely (which is ok, your body is supposed to sweat, that's how you get rid of toxins), but I also don't sweat a crazy amount either - it is tolerable.Application of this deodorant is a little bit different from your traditional antiperspirants and deodorants.  This stick tends to be very solid and firm and you need to soften it a little bit by holding it against your under-arm so your body heat will soften it up a bit, then you can easily glide it across your skin to apply it.  I find that my skin is a little sensitive to it if I have just shaved under my arms, so I try to work it so that I shave on a day when I know I can stay at home and skip deodorant that day.  Other than that I have had no problem with my skin reacting or breaking out from this.Overall I really like it- it's a well made product that works for me, I definitely plan on buying more when this has run out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0D0DEKBCM7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVRCQ0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3J0D0DEKBCM7T","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have the Knot Genie hairbrush for my daughter's hair which is very fine and thin and tangles very easily.  The brush works good but can be a pain to hold onto after you've been holding it for a while.  I was interested in this brush because it looks like the same kind of brush but with a handle on it.  It is the same style of brush as the Knot Genie, but the bristles are much stiffer than the ones on the Knot Genie.  This one does get the hair free of knots faster, but it also pulls a bit more than the other brush.  I do prefer this one because of the handle - if you're the one doing the brushing it's nice to have something to wrap your fingers around and hold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K08GOTTA256K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDZ733M#wasThisHelpful","R2K08GOTTA256K","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have some likes and dislikes about this particular brand/style of food.  I think my cat likes the flavor ok, but she doesn't like pate foods - she prefers chunky wet food.  She ate a little of this when I first put it down but then didn't go back to it for a long time when she realized I wasn't going to give her anything else - in the end she did finish it but I could tell it wasn't her favorite because she didn't gobble it down like she usually does with wet food.I really like the ingredient listing - all of their products are grain free with no corn, wheat or soy, and no added poultry by-products, no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.  It's a really great ingredient listing compared to many you find out there these days, but you also pay a higher price for that great ingredient listing.

"My almost 7-year old first grader who is an excellent independent reader was very excited to get this book, it looked like something that would be right up her alley.  I was a little surprised (but not very) when she finished the book in one day - she didn't read it non-stop but she did pick it up several times during the day and by bedtime had finished it.  The book is divided into easy, short chapters for beginning readers.  Cute and colorful pictures are on every page to help describe the actions in the story.  I thought the story was cute - about a young owl named Eva who tries to take on a bit more than she can handle in planning the spring festival, and she learns that it's ok to ask for help and also that you can't judge a book (or in this case other owls) by their covers.  It was a simple yet effective lesson that I think is applicable and important for young kids to learn, but the story made it seem interesting and cute.  I think the book will definitely appeal more to girls than boys (the main character is a girl, and the colors/pictures lean more towards things that girls favor), but that doesn't mean boys won't enjoy the story too.This was a hit with my daughter, and she wants me to get the next book in the series as soon as it's available. I think the publisher's recommended age of 5-7 is spot-on, any younger might have trouble with it, and an older reader might find the book a bit short and slow for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DME94U037DVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545683629#wasThisHelpful","R3DME94U037DVX","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box that the stroller comes in wasn't very well made - it was starting to come apart at the seams but thankfully that didn't affect what was inside at all.  The other issue I have with the box is that it shows all of the colors that the strollers come in, which can be misleading to a child who is looking at the box and doesn't understand that the color of the stroller coming out of the box isn't necessarily the same as the color of the stroller pictures on the box.Those things aside, this is an awesome little doll stroller - built to look and operate like a real baby stroller.  While detailed assembly instructions are included they weren't really needed. It took just a few minutes to pop the wheels into place and snap the bassinet/seat onto the frame.  Two small buttons located on the inside of the frame allow you to move the handle from one side to the other, and the bassinet part easily (but not TOO easily) tips forwards or backwards so you can have the doll laying down or sitting up.  It also folds fairly easily and compactly for storage which was nice since my daughter insisted on taking it to the store for shopping. My 6 year old needs a little help if she wants to move the handle from one side to the other, she's not quite coordinated enough to do it on her own yet. Overall it's really cute, seems to be very well built and my daughter loves it.  The color of the one we got is the black and teal and is very true to the color pictured here - it's a nice change from all of the pink doll items out there. Overall it's a fantastic doll stroller for the price, definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8VRXMWDQJIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGB25SS#wasThisHelpful","R2M8VRXMWDQJIG","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been on the hunt for a while to find a pencil sharpener that my almost 7-year old can use.  We have several of the old fashioned little plastic ones that you have to insert and turn the pencil, and a nice electric one but she has a hard time with both of these with finding the right amount of pressure to get the pencil sharp but not so sharp that the tip easily breaks.  This pencil sharpener from Bostitch is different because you don't need pressure to sharpen the pencil - it uses a ratcheting mechanism to sharpen the pencil as you twist the pencil/sharpener back and forth.  There is also a little button you can turn on the sharpener that allows you to adjust how sharp you make the pencil, so you can avoid getting a very pointy tip that will easily break.  After a few tries my daughter was able to use this easily by herself so we're both quite happy with it.  It's a great price, comes in multiple fun bright colors, and is small and portable and will fit easily in any kid's backpack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193XRR4ASO0LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDVE9UA#wasThisHelpful","R193XRR4ASO0LA","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work very well as far as sanitizing - I keep a container in multiple rooms of the house and in the car.  They are easy to pull from the container and have almost no smell at all which is nice as some sanitizing wipes I've noticed can have a very strong chemical smell.  I've used them on everything from hands to door-knobs, cleaning around the toilet, counter-tops, on the kitchen floor, cleaning the stove-top, there really isn't much you can't use these on.  While the wipes are very sturdy and strong I find them at the same time a bit abrasive, which is nice if you're scrubbing or cleaning something that needs a little bit of elbow grease.  I find however that when it comes to cleaning and in the process of cleaning also needing to wipe something (say specks of dirt or food or what-not) off of a surface, it's hard to wipe anything substantial up with these.  I have to keep wiping a few times to pick up anything like crumbs or cat little from the surface I'm cleaning, where as when using the Chlorox-brand wipes I normally use that have a softer surface I don't seem to have as hard of a time.Overall for cleaning purposes I prefer the Chlorox brand wipes, but as far as just sanitizing surfaces these work just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GX20SB84HEM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PD0J1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1GX20SB84HEM6","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these headphones from Turtle Beach are 'branded' as Call of Duty, they can be used with any game played on the Xbox One console.  The Call of Duty plates can even be removed or swapped for other plates if you want to shell out more money for different plates.  The sound quality is excellent - other players sound like they are in the room with me when I'm playing and they say they can hear me really well on their side.  I really liked that the volume level changes - as you increase the volume of voice chat the game volume decreases so you're not competing to hear one over the other. The microphone is removable and while the headphones are wireless as far as connection to the Xbox, there is a wire attached for connection to other devices (ipad and such).  It would have been nice if this wire was removable, because if it becomes damaged you can't replace just the damaged wire.Overall great sound, they are comfortable although the cups cover the ears so well there was a bit of heat build-up after extended use but they were still very comfortable.

"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my Frozen-obsessed 6 year old, only because I got a really good price on it through Amazon.  If not for the really good price, I would say I think this is very over-priced given how small it is, and how flimsy the chain is, and it's not something I would really recommend for a young child. A child aged 10 or older I'm sure would be much more appreciative of the value and delicacy of the necklace, and be more careful with it. The chain is very thin and will easily break, it's not for little kids fingers.  The snowflake is very beautiful but very tiny - as the description states it's only 3/4 of an inch in diameter.The necklace came packaged in a pretty light blue box for gift giving, and while there is a foam square in the box that has slits to hold the chain in place my necklace was not pulled through the slits so it had tumbled around inside the box during shipping and was in a unruly tangle by the time I opened the box.  I had to spend a good 5 minutes with a pair of tweezers and a lot of patience trying to untangle it and was afraid I would end up breaking the thin chain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLXVFF2WJKB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P80JH42#wasThisHelpful","R2JLXVFF2WJKB7","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dreaming Spies brings Mary and Sherlock on a long cruise to Japan, during which they become involved in a mystery that immerses them in the world of ninjas and royal secrets, and loyalty amongst both family and friends.  Laurie King has done a fantastic job of presenting the Japanese culture as it would have been found in the 1920's both on and off Japanese soil and through the character of Haruki Sato. As she has in many of her other works she also does an incredible job of painting the story with words - describing everything in such detail as it would be seen through the eyes of two of the world's greatest detectives.  Working as the perfect tag-team of detectives that only Mary and Sherlock can be, they work to unravel the case only to discover in the end that even they did not have all of the pieces of the puzzle.  While I enjoyed the story very much and found it very easy to dive into, after all of the ups and downs of their journey throughout the book, I found the ending to be a bit of a let-down and anti-climactic.  I do have a feeling though that Haruki Sato will join Mary and Sherlock on a future adventure and am looking forward to the next adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUCLJ3853RP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345531795#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUCLJ3853RP4","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My almost 7 year-old has really enjoyed other Gamewright games such as Rat A Tat Cat and Sleeping Queens, but those have become a bit too easy for her so we decided to try one of their games that is for an older age level.  The concept of the game is simple enough - you want to have as few moose in your house as you can and put as many moose in the other players house as you can.  We played the first several hands of the game with the cards in our hands face-up on the table so we could learn easier and help each other play, and after we got the hang of things we were able to progress to holding our cards in our hands as you're supposed to.It's a fun and addicting game for 2 or more people, with fun and colorful pictures on the cards. The instructions are clear and well-written and show samples of the game play.

"I tried to like this - more than once, but I just couldn't get past the taste.  The chocolate part wasn't bad, the raspberry just tasted so artificial, it made me think of the fruit flavoring that you get with any type of children's medicine  - even though the flavor says 'grape' or 'orange' or 'cherry' the medicine doesn't taste anything like any of those fruits.  That's what this reminded me of - I've never tasted a raspberry that tasted like this.The texture was fine - it was smooth and creamy, reminded me of the texture of store-bought chocolate milk.  While the ingredient list is impressive as far as vitamins and protein content, I was disappointed to see the controversial ingredient carrageenan is included on the list. For those not familiar with it I suggest doing a bit of research - it's a known cancer causing agent and is unfortunately added to many food items these days, much like the nasty high fructose corn syrup.I can't say much as to how satisfying it was to stave off cravings between meals, as I wasn't able to manage more than a few sips before tossing what was left.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RERAMAYU5EOTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL5ZYS4#wasThisHelpful","RERAMAYU5EOTV","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As my cat moves up in her senior years her joints have become painful to her from arthritis and she developed a severe limp and was crying when she walked.  The first thing our vet recommended was giving her a cosequin supplement to help relieve her symptoms. I first purchased a different brand from our local Petsmart since it was convenient to stop there - needless to say it was not cheap.  Once we figured out that the medicine did help the cat significantly I did some shopping around and price comparison, and this brand is the cheapest I've found for the quantity and if you factor in free shipping (assuming you're buying at least $35 of other Amazon-eligible items which we always do).  The capsules are in a bottle that does not have a child-proof cover (something to keep in mind if you have little ones in the house), so they are easy to access.  Other brands I've purchased were in individual blister packaged cards which was a pain, so this is much easier.  The capsules easily open so you can sprinkle the powder onto your cat's food - my cat scarfs down her food every time, she has never turned her nose up indicating she detects any medicine mixed in with her food. As long as I continue to add the cosequin to her food twice a day her limp stays away and she is pain free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGPKGK3WMW4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4W02M#wasThisHelpful","R2BGPKGK3WMW4W","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm happy with everything in the set with the exception of the dog - it was very poorly put together, and even that I'm willing to overlook rather than deal with the hassle of sending it back to Amazon and ordering another hoping it turns out better.  The ears seem to be sewn on almost sideways so that they sort of cover the eyes, and they are badly misaligned so one ear is much more forward than the other. Aside from that, the dog is very cute - very plush and soft.  The little accessories are cute and everything is just the right size to be used with any 18 inch doll.  The leash does not have a small loop to fit over the doll's hand, even though it is pictured that way.  A dab of super glue or a few minutes with needle and thread can easily fix this.  Overall I'm happy with the set considering how much you are getting with this, compared to how much you would pay for the stuffed animal alone from American Girl.  Everything comes in a cute little box that has the picture show here on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KC4K0LQIXQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIVQMTM#wasThisHelpful","R25KC4K0LQIXQ2","A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An advance reading copy was provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. As was the 30th volume of Writers of the Future, volume 31 is a great anthology of SF/F. The stories by the new authors are excellent and the ones by the established writers, terrific. The essays about the trade were also very good. The illustrations are stunning. Congratulations to editor David Farland for having assembled such an excellent work. These new writers will be the next generation of SF/F authors and I am glad that I had the opportunity to read them now.

"An advanced reader copy was provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I enjoyed this book. Author Jeffery Lewis put together a short but amusing look at the life of baby boomers as told by expressions and song and movie titles. Lewis uses these to tell a somewhat disjointed story of the world as baby boomers knew it when we were young and how we know it today. Parts were superficial but some were very insightful and meaningful such as describing November 22, 1963 with a particularly poignant movie title. I recommend this book for baby boomers because of its insights and nostalgia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWA8UR4AAQO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5GRZ06#wasThisHelpful","R1FWA8UR4AAQO4","A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book is look at the history and philosophy of science built around evolving concepts of the Earthâ€™s age and movement. The first two sections of the book were on these two subjects and while it was a comprehensive look, the writing could have been more lively and conversational. The third part of the book was quite good and looked at scientific truths and how different religions dealt with them. The writing here was indeed more lively and I feel that this is closer to what author Hubert Krivine wanted the reader to take away from the book.

"Author Alex Marshall crafted an interesting story with crisp action and colorful characters. But the book has more gore than I am comfortable with, in line with the goriness of Steven Eriksonâ€™s Malazan Book of the Fallen series. But unlike Malazan, there is not enough humor to balance the violence. The story also lacks chemistry between the protagonists, the type that can be found in Django Wexlerâ€™s Shadow Campaigns or Michael Sullivanâ€™s Riyria books. Nonetheless, the book is well worth reading and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys the Fantasy genre.Disclosure: I received this book for free as an advanced reader copy in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBWWAT13DCOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316277983#wasThisHelpful","R3GBWWAT13DCOT","A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She also freely expresses her opinions about the subject, but is always clear about what is factual, what is opinion and what is speculation. Shapiro integrates some personal anecdotes into the book and creates a relationship with the reader. When I finished reading the book, I felt I was saying goodbye to a friend I had just met.

The authors also discuss the development of new technologies and how religious/conservative forces frequently reject these technologies. The book is philosophically similar to The Bible Is Not Great: The Truth About The Bible, Religion And God by Soren Sagan But the the Singh/Shook effort is much better written and the science is more accurate and detailed.

"I read this book (that I received for free in return for an honest review) because the title led me to believe that the book was about author George Takeiâ€™s experiences related to Star Trek. And to some degree Takei addresses it but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. However Takei is a good story teller and the book is nonetheless interesting, which reflects the very interesting life that Takei had led up to that point, including time spent in an internment camp during World War Two. The book covers Takeiâ€™s life until 1991 which coincides with the release of Star Trek VI-The undiscovered country and the death of Gene Roddenberry. The only significant weakness of the book is that Takei tends to be melodramatic. Nonetheless, I liked the book and recommend it for Trekkers and for anyone who wants an inside look at the entertainment industry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHK6UYMCCQSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDPKAJ0#wasThisHelpful","REHK6UYMCCQSX","A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I recommend this book for anyone interested in evolution. It makes an interesting counterpoint to Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene.

Chapters 2, 3 and 4 were about US involvement in public health programs in Brazil, Cuba and Puerto Rico as a tool for U.S. imperialism. These chapters are very interesting although Amador could have spend more time on Yellow Fever eradication in Cuba.  And finally chapter 5 ties it all together but this time through a discussion of culture. This too, I should have found boring but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.

The coda at the end of the book are amazing for their emotion. This book is a must-read for any fan of the science fiction genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFTJ5D9ELWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079XPUOW#wasThisHelpful","R3UFTJ5D9ELWC","A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this book should more appropriately be â€œHow I was a husband.â€ As author Tim Dowling explains, this book is not advice or self help, which based on what I read, is probably a good thing. I wonâ€™t comment on Dowling as a husband or father because this canâ€™t really be judged on the basis of some selected stories. Some of the stories were funny, some were serious, and some made me wince, but they are all well written. Particularly entertaining are the lists of things that Dowling creates. I recommend this book for married men who will inevitably compare their marriages with that of Dowling. To women, I just want to be clear that this book is about a sample of one and does not reflect the general married-men population. Nonetheless this should be an enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3RVAXABQZA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9B7YWG#wasThisHelpful","R3A3RVAXABQZA9","A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book. I found it hard to put down once I started it. Yuval Noah Harari writes with a good sense of humor and some sarcasm. The book is a fascinating look at how society developed through three revolutions: cultural, agricultural, and scientific. The book covers the history  of Asia, Europe and the western hemisphere. While it is along the lines of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, I feel that Harariâ€™s conclusions were better grounded than Diamondâ€™s. Although I recommend both books, if you are only going to read one, then I strongly recommend Harariâ€™s.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GE7BQNKRIXGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTCH382#wasThisHelpful","R3GE7BQNKRIXGZ","A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1J1K5Y8Q7PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, disclosure: I received this book as an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review. Second, I enjoyed this book. I liked the storyline and the characters. The illustrations are excellent and helped tell a story.The book had a couple of minor weaknesses. Children who are more familiar with the genre might find some some of the elements a bit juvenile. In addition, some parts of the story were less science fiction and more fantasy. However neither of this is significant and might actually be good for younger readers. I also think that this is a good book for children new to science fiction.

"John Wright wrote an interesting book about how the various forms of life got their Latin names. Using anecdotes and humor, Wright lifted the subject out of what could have been a boring book. The classification of life is important, but the methods behind the classification are not well known.  As a university student, I must have memorized hundreds of Latin names but never really gave the science of taxonomy much thought. I am glad that Wright has paid tribute to these scientists. The one thing about the book that I didnâ€™t like is that there was very little said about the microbial world, but as a microbiologist, I might be biased.

"I have read a lot of books that follow the same â€˜law of attractionâ€™ premise and find that many of them simply tell the reader to rely on wishful-thinking and donâ€™t offer any practical advice that can be applied and practiced. That being said, I was glad to find that the author, Lak, avoids this solely wishful-thinking approach and instead offers genuine advice that is applicable and reasonable and which I am sure many different people can relate to â€“as an admitted realist and pragmatist, I am glad that the author has chosen this direction for the book.I found the sections regarding inner conflict and environment to be very helpful, but I do think that some of the other parts could have benefited from a bit more elaboration.

"I ended up finishing Thabo Nkomoâ€™s â€œThe Night Is My Dominionâ€ in a single sitting last night and must say that I found myself hooked essentially from beginning to end.Derek is certainly an admirable protagonist and his character is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed the book so much; I think itâ€™s easy for authors to get lost in the detective archetype and try to do what everyone else is doing, which is something I come across often, so I was glad to see that this author wasnâ€™t afraid to try something new and the end result has led to a genuinely unique and interesting character.The thriller genre is my favorite of them all, and I must admit that I can be a bit overly-critical towards some thriller books because I feel that many authors donâ€™t do the genre justice. That being said, and although I still think â€œThe Night Is My Dominionâ€ could benefit from improvement and some extra editing, I am ultimately quite satisfied with the read and I look forward to seeing what else the author will be able to offer readers in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YT5ST9X4L61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017T6UK0W#wasThisHelpful","R25YT5ST9X4L61","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will be honest, I usually am quite negatively biased against the sci-fi genre and often disregard it completely; I can be far too selective when it comes to books with futuristic themes and so I went into this read with my usual skeptical demeanor. That being said, I must say that â€œForeign Distrustâ€ definitely went way above and beyond my initial expectations and I truly do think that it has been put together very well.The plot is original and has many scenes that had me wondering what was going to happen next, yet most of the time the situation would pan out differently (as a major thriller fan, I love this vibe). The characters were complex and the dialogue between actually seemed quite realistic and dynamic in a way that made it easy for me to become involved with the book.Overall, Iâ€™d give Foreign Distrust a 8/10 â€“ there were a few scenes that the book could have done without and others that would benefit from being expanded upon more, but other than that, Iâ€™d still consider it a worthy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4B0XHCEYFOE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017SZ9PCI#wasThisHelpful","R4B0XHCEYFOE6","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My child is much younger than the authorâ€™s, but I could still definitely understand his reasoning behind dealing with such erratic behavior.

"Of course, with these kind of books, a fast-paced plot filled with plenty of action and twists and turns is absolutely essential; in this regard, I think the author has it spot on. Besides that, I also found the dialogue in Eric Meyer's book to be especially well-structured and it does a great job of helping portray the characters in a way that makes the majority of them seem dynamic and far from two-dimensional. Iâ€™d be more than willing to bet that the author has had quite some extensive military experience, as it seems to be evident through the accuracy and detail throughout the writing, which is probably influential in regard to the aforementioned.Admittedly, I did find a few scenes and interactions between people to be a bit over-the-top and maybe playing on the warfare theme a little too much- but only a few parts stood out to me in this way.Iâ€™d recommend this real to anyone looking for a raw, gritty and immersive story that flows nearly from start to finish due to great writing style; Iâ€™m a big fan of war thrillers in general, and found Black Ops to be quite satisfying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GJEQ9IYR725/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DWZFNK#wasThisHelpful","R8GJEQ9IYR725","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone that knows of my reading habits is aware that, not dissimilar to Marcus Ryanâ€™s original aversion to magic, I have often been found to stay far away from the fantasy genre except under the rare circumstances when the odd book catches my eye. The Sanctum of Souls has been one of those books for me, and although it wonâ€™t be a game-changer in regard to my literary tastes, I can say that I now have an idea and slight understanding of what all the fuss about fantasy books are for.I think the main reason of why I enjoyed this read is due to the authorâ€™s writing style, the prose is very clean and expresses the strange elements of the plot in vivid detail that made it quite easy for me to become involved with the characters and become immersed into the read. I do think that there were a few parts that the book could have done without, but with a book of this length I often find that this is something that is often impossible to avoid.In summary, I enjoyed it â€“ I canâ€™t say that I will be rushing to buy the authorâ€™s other books as soon as I get the chance, but I certainly wonâ€™t be trying to avoid them either! 7/10","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16UJ4300MC7C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016FRYYZI#wasThisHelpful","R16UJ4300MC7C2","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had read the first two books in the series before grabbing this bundle and although I had mixed thoughts at first, I decided to keep going at it mainly because I couldnâ€™t resist the price. I went straight for book 3 and found right away that the author seems to have developed quite a lot since the previous two in the series and the momentum didnâ€™t subside all the way to the end, with the exception of a few minor hiccups.The writing reminds me a little bit of author Ellie Danes, whom I have come to admire quite a bit as of recently, but Christina Clarkâ€™s original style is very prominent throughout the series which keeps the story fresh and unique. There are numerous twists thrown in throughout the series (book 4 especially) which helps add some spice to the linearity of the plot and give it a bit of a thriller vibe that I also enjoyed. To rate the series as a whole as it stands, I give it a 7.5.

Itâ€™s no secret that the digital medium is rapidly expanding and changing each day, so Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new resources that are insightful and relevant, and Iâ€™d say that Ryan Nelsonâ€™s â€œHow to Make Money Onlineâ€ is definitely one of them.The writing style is clear and concise and the book doesnâ€™t just focus on one specific route, it offers a variety of different ideas that Iâ€™m sure many people will be able to follow with their own set of skills.Overall, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s worth the read for beginners without much prior online knowledge and maybe the more experienced will be able to find some value.

Iâ€™ve had nothing but good reactions from my little brother while sharing her stories with him, even though heâ€™s far from an avid-reader, so it goes without saying that Iâ€™m very impressed by the authorâ€™s storytelling abilities in regard to how well she captures the essence that is so essential when it comes to making children's books effective.

"""Middle of Nothing"" is one of the few reads that I have came across as of recently where I found myself hooked right in the beginning, with a 'page-turner' allure that stays strong throughout most of the book. I found the protagonist to be created especially well, the narration used to express his feelings and experiences are vivid in detail and portray him as a realistic, dynamic figure that made it very easy for me to become immersed into the story.This may have been the first book that I have read by Scott Reed, but I can definitely say that it won't be the last, as I will be keeping an eye out for future releases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAFA8N2G1QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUWEHXG#wasThisHelpful","R3IAFA8N2G1QX","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a fan of the romance genre and always find myself coming back to it after I adventure into different kinds of books. Problem is, I find that many authors are using the same plots and archetypes and often many of the stories seem too predictable to me.  I stumbled upon Maria E. Pinto's ""They knew no limits...""  and was more than happy to find that she isn't afraid to think outside of the box and try something new, throwing in plenty of twists and turns that give it a great mystery/thriller vibe, and expressing it all through a vivid writing style.If you're a fan of love stories that are far from typical and intertwined with a great mystery vibe then I highly recommend this book.

"Each year, my house ends up being the rendezvous point for most of my extended family to get together and enjoy Thanksgiving with each other. This usually means that I have close to two dozen or more people to cater for and so, with Thanksgiving right around the corner, I decided to buy a few recipe books beforehand to get some ideas in hopes of trying something new this year - which is what led me to this.Jamie Stewart's ended up being the fourth book that I read, and although I did find some inspiration from the others, I must say that I feel I've gotten the most value for price from this - 200 recipes for under a dollar is hard to beat no matter what the genre, and the recipes all seem of a very high quality.Definitely looking forward to trying the cheesy cauliflower and pumpkin mash as well as some of the vegan recipes I came across because, as a meat-eater, I often find it hard to compromise. more than satisfied!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRN9NRTZL89P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AL8LNO#wasThisHelpful","RRN9NRTZL89P7","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spend about 6 months of the year living in Colorado and, as most smokers now, itâ€™s been legal to possess and grow up to 6 plants here on a personal basis, which obviously opened up a lot of avenues for bigger more-established legal businesses to move into the marijuana industry- especially when it pertains to medical use. I have never used marijuana too avidly through my life but I learned enough about it to keep me from being naïve to the huge potential that the merging market is offering to entrepreneurs, not only just in CO and other more weed-friendly states but also on a national scale.Anyway, with that being said, I can say that as of today Iâ€™ve read at least a dozen marijuana business books so far this year and I must say that Megan Dealâ€™s is certainly up there with the best that Iâ€™ve came across so far. The writing style is concise, straightforward, and offers plenty of business advice that can be applied to a wide variety of ventures, including those not based around marijuana. I found the sections regarding Real Estate services to be especially helpful and theyâ€™ve caused me to think up some ideas of my own that I look forward to putting into practice.Obviously, I did enjoy the book but I do think that some parts could have been elaborated upon further and the list of dispensaries could certainly have been cut down substantially or been in the form of a link directing to another page.

"I originally became aware of the author, Mike Sheridan, when I discovered one of his other books 'Eat Meat and Stop Jogging'. Even though I went into that book as a skeptic, I found myself to be very impressed with the author's unique style and approach to fitness, especially his way of avoiding all the myths and BS that are so prevalent in this genre (really, how many more 'lose X amount of pounds within a week' and other ridiculous claims do we need saturating the market??).I am glad to say that nearly all of the aspects of the writing style and approach to health that I admired in the previous book that I read were evident throughout Live it Not Diet. Mike Sheridan does an excellent job of skipping all of the jargon, instead choosing to get right to the point in a way that is easy to understand and certainly practical. The approach is far from a 'get fit overnight' scheme, the premise is instead based on building a long term and stable plan that I'm sure many different people can find value from.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWT23TYAR8UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBP264S#wasThisHelpful","R3KWT23TYAR8UC","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me personally, 'Sideswiped' is defined by a clean prose style, a hook that catches you from the very beginning, and a suspenseful vibe throughout most of the book that leaves you wanting to find out what happens next at the end of each chapter without pause.Having had a few close friends who have been in the military and whom have had their fair share of war experiences between them, I can say that Russell Moran has really hit the nail on the head in regard to making Matt Blake seem as realistic and genuine as possible to the Marine veteran personality. The hardened attitude, different perspective, and even the vocab in the dialogue is seemingly spot on.Of course, there's a lot more to Sideswiped than this, and the plot itself ventures down many paths, but I find it essential for books like these to have great narration to help me get immersed into the read, and Russell Moran has done an excellent job of doing so with the character of Matt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243A9ECJQYKXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014X9QI4U#wasThisHelpful","R243A9ECJQYKXL","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often that I find myself venturing into the sci-fi genre, especially the books that have a prominent dystopian theme - but the summary of Nyxe seemed unique compared to all the other sci-fi reads I have encountered as of recently (Is it just me or is everyone playing with the same archetypes and ideas??) and so I decided to give it a gamble.Well, with that being said, I can say that I am more than happy that I gave Nyxe a chance. The plot is creative, the narration is executed in a smooth manner that flows well from essentially start to finish, and, ultimately - it's in general an enjoyable read. I'm not completely convinced that the sci-fi genre is going to be one that I will revisit again often in the future, but Nyxe has left me with a good impression and I'll be keeping an eye out for similar reads.To put it briefly, I recommend this book for those readers out there whom are looking for an original, fresh twist to the dystopian theme.

"At first, I assumed that this book primarily would be focused more in regard to learning to respect other people's boundaries after starting the process of recovery and beginning to adjust back into the sober life. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the author offers plenty of advice about this this, but she also touches deeply on setting your own personal boundaries - for instance, not being self-critical, co-dependent or feeling inadequate due to another person's actions, or letting other people's views define you.One particular sentence that stood out to me when I read the sample is: ""Whether in early recovery or sober many years, it often becomes clear that just putting down the drink and the drugs simply isn't enough to live a happy and purposeful life."" As an alcoholic, I find myself relating to this in more ways than one. When I began my own personal process, I found that I had to do a sort of 'damage-control' with my relationships with family and friends, mainly stemmed from guilt and anxiety that stayed with me even after I stopped drinking. I have found that this part of the process isn't elaborated on often in books like these, so I am very happy that the author has dedicated such insightful writing to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UI89LF3KX5KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01702IGDS#wasThisHelpful","R2UI89LF3KX5KL","A1SVA69J57MX2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SVA69J57MX2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honestly, the title and premise of 'Eat Meat and Stop Jogging' had me skeptical at first, but I also found it to be an intriguing approach compared to all of the other mainstream, generic e-books that are currently saturating the market, so that's what ultimately led me to giving `Eat Meat and Stop Jogging' a chance.With that being said, I can now say that I am more than glad that I decided to give it a chance, as the author has simply gone way above and beyond my initial expectations in several ways, whilst leaving me with an author name to keep an eye on. There's plenty of myths that are dispelled through scientific studies (oh, and plenty of sources for those, like myself, who love to fact-check) and, from what I have gathered while reading the book, the author focuses on giving a neutral, unbiased perspective which is obviously essential when it comes to any kind books in the health niche (I suppose there is some natural bias behind the writing, but I feel that the author isn't afraid to openly criticize certain points of what he is talking about).Some of the formatting, especially when it came to the pictures, seemed quite off.

"This is a gorgeous bag! Nicely made, very sturdy, a nice rich color, strong zippers and a great size. The inside lining is gorgeous too and the overall look of this purse/bookbag is stunning. I can fit some of my books in it when I need to read on the run and pretty much anything else that I would need to carry with me as well. As a mom I always have a random selection of things in my purse and this one does well to hold them all. It also allows me to be hands free whenever I need to be, because I can just sling it on my back, that is invaluable so many times!

"This fun toy hits the spots that others can't, namely two at a time. I am a dual stimulation kinda girl and this toy does that and more. It has just the right amount of power and It is sleek and smooth, except for the flat nubby stimulation part. I love that this toy is angled just right to hold in my own hand or let my husband do the work for me. Purple is one of my favorite colors, so that doesn't hurt either.

Oral health is so very important to all your other health and there has never been a simpler way to floss and it is gentle and doesn't leave his gums bleeding like actual floss tends too.

"I have spent a fortune buying the parts of this supplement separately to help with my rheumatoid arthritis, so finding it all together and in the high doses that this supplement is in, is a blessing. You can feel within just the first few days an ease in movement that you haven't had in a while, or at least I did. This works to stop future damage and does do a little towards helping the existing damage to your joints. That being said, nothing is a miracle, but this can't hurt either. I absolutely love this brand's joint support because it is the highest dosage of the ingredients that I can find and the cost for this product is wonderful in comparison to drug store brands with lower milligrams.

This is a much better solution that looks soooooooooo much better! I can now find what I am looking for with ease. These look terrific as well. They are very sturdy, obviously, or they wouldnâ€™t be able to hold my books. They fold up easily to store away when I donâ€™t need them.

"With a home surrounded by oak trees, we are constantly sweeping the deck, porch, and stairs.  Occasionally I will whip out the loud smelly gas blower but only if I'm already sweaty and grimy from yard work.  Then I discovered the WORXAIR!  This tool is perfect for ""sweeping"" the deck, porch, and stairs around the house.  It's lightweight, relatively quiet, and very effective at blowing off the leaves and light dirt.However, this is NOT for large scale landscaping jobs.  The problem is the battery.  In my experience the battery begins to lose power and the blower loses effectiveness after about 20 minutes of use.  This isn't a big deal for the way I use it because that's about as long as it takes to do the job.  But it's important to recharge the battery after every use.An otherwise perfect light duty blower.

"I just had my home painted by professional house painters and decided to get my own sprayer after watching how quickly and easily they were able to paint my house with a sprayer.  To be clear, the sprayers used to paint an entire house are much more expensive, costing upwards of $500 or more, but then they are also much more capable of pumping gallons of paint per hour.For only $120.00 The PaintWIZ is perfect for small to medium sized painting projects.  With no previous experience with a sprayer and no formal instruction other than watching the painters who sprayed my house, I was able to paint several panels of wooden lattice in less than an hour including clean  up.  One word of caution, although the video implies that the spray is precise enough to avoid taping off areas you don't want to paint I would advise carefully taping off those areas.  Even the professionals were careful to tape of and cover anything they didn't want to paint.

"For the past few years I've been using Firelighters Wood Starting Cubes made by a company called ""If You Care"".  The If You Care - Firelighters Wood Starting Cubes only cost 40 cents each and it usually only takes 1 cube to start a fire.The Aura Outdoor Products AOP-FS24 All Natural Charcoal Fire Starters cost 70 cents each and take at least 2 to start a fire.

They just don't stay lit as long as the The If You Care - Firelighters Wood Starting Cubes and they leave a paper ash block in the fire box.I'm giving a three star ""it's okay"" rating because they do work, but they are expensive and there's a less expensive and superior alternative available from Amazon.com with Firelighters Wood Starting Cubes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NMZKOUFA13K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN0IN2S#wasThisHelpful","R1NMZKOUFA13K6","AJ0HFDY5BB77Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0HFDY5BB77Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After assembling the lamp and screwing the articulating arm to the base of the lamp, I was surprised to learn that it's not engineered to swivel left to right.  This is a design flaw for which 1 star was deducted.  Also, the cheap plastic switch on the top of the shade has too much play in it.  The switch wiggles clockwise and counterclockwise about two inches in each direction before activating the switch.  Cheap quality parts deducts another star.The pros:  it's a very inexpensive lamp.  The 60 watt 900 lumen bulb is one of the batter CFLs I've used.

"The sound is very good for such a small speaker and the battery life is more than adequate.  Pairing was very simple from both an iPhone and iPad Air 2.  I tried using it in the pool just to test it out and it's an interesting novelty, but the sound is significantly degraded once it gets dunked.  Pull it out and shake it off and it sounds just fine, but there really is no need to have a speaker floating around in the pool with you.  The real beauty of the floating feature is the durability and insurance policy it provides should the speaker be accidentally dropped into the water, but honestly the floating feature is a bit of a gimmick.My go to outdoor bluetooth speaker is still the Eton NRKS400GR Rugged Rukus Xtreme.

"I deducted one star for two reasons.  First, because the Resurgence Case doesn't work with the standard USB/Lightning cable, my new lightning car charger was rendered obsolete with this case.  I had to replace my new car charger with a Belkin charger that has an open USB port for the micro USB cable supplied with the case.

"I'll admit at the outset of this review that a 4 star rating for the KitchenAid KVJ0111CU may be considered by some to be rather generous.  However, I chose not to ding the product for what I perceived to be shortcomings for me personally.  This machine makes juice and it does it well.  However, from start to finish: assembly, fruit preparation, juice extraction, clean up - it takes about a half an hour to make three cups of juice.  So for me, this is not a daily driver but a machine that I will use to prepare large batches of juice to last a few days or to prepare fresh juice for cocktails prior to a party.  It's not the type of appliance that quickly makes a cup of juice for breakfast on the go.The attached photograph illustrates all of the parts that must be assembled before use and then disassembled and thoroughly cleaned afterwards.  The instructions do advise that all of the parts are top shelf dishwasher safe, but I choose to wash everything carefully by hand to ensure that all of the parts are free of debris before storage.  Dishwashers are notoriously hard on plastic and don't reach every nook and cranny, so hand washing is advised for sanitary reasons and to prolong the life of the machine.Overall I'm very satisfied with the KitchenAid KVJ0111CU and I anticipate many years of service from what is a very rugged, effective appliance.  I've always wanted to experiment with homemade sauces and marinades and the KitchenAid KVJ0111CU is the perfect appliance for the gourmet chef with plenty of time.  For making large batches of juice (three cups at a time) and for gourmet cooks who prepare fresh made from scratch marinades and sauces, this is a nice solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AU59GE6ILA9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVNKGNU#wasThisHelpful","R1AU59GE6ILA9W","AJ0HFDY5BB77Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0HFDY5BB77Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Eton NRKS400GR Rugged Rukus Xtreme for about a month now both indoors and out.  The dynamic range of the sound from this little box is nothing short of amazing.The solar charging feature worked flawlessly at the beach.

I placed the unit directly in the sun and to my surprise it played continuously for 8 hours!I chose the Eton over the Bose SoundLink because It sounds better than the Bose speaker, takes up less room, is splash proof, rugged, solar powered, and doubles as a charger for a phone - all for $100 less than the cost of the Bose.  The Eton is an all around superior product for 30% less money than Bose.There is one design peculiarity to look out for:  The Power Port and AUX Port are the same size and therefore it's easy to plug a cable into the wrong port.

"Overall, I like the styling of the watch.  It's heavy enough to give it a good quality feel and the leather strap is thick enough that it should last a long time.  The one major flaw in the design is the chrome hands over a shiny white face.  There is not enough contrast between the hands and the face to easily read the time.  One has to rotate the wrist to get a reflection on the hands to read the time.  It looks good on the wrist, but it's not as functional as it could be.  The other flaw is the timer function.  The faces of the timers are so small that they are virtually useless.  They are there only for the design element, not functionality.Also, if you're considering this as a gift be aware that it is packaged in a rather cheap and juvenile looking tin box with cardboard lining.  This is a $105.00 man's dress watch, but the packaging looks like it was designed for a $25.00 child's watch.

" 0:07 MinsThe camera was easy to set up and easy to mount.  The only mounting options are up or down.  To give the user more flexibility in mounting, It would be helpful to be able to mount the camera sideways as well, but at this time it's not an option unless you can tolerate watching the video at a 90 degree angle.  A simple software and/or firmware update would fix this so I hope Belkin will consider this option for a future update.Although the camera is designed to use indoors, I've been trying to use the camera to monitor my front porch through a window.  However, as you can see in the attached video, the IR night vision will not work through glass.  Also, regardless of how I adjust the sensitivity, the slightest sense of motion triggers a recording and email alert.  This may be fine for indoors, but if you're trying to monitor an area outside all it takes is for the wind to blow a tree or flag and the motion detector sets off.  I'll continue to use it this way, but I""m hoping for a software and/or firmware update that will address the sensitivity issue.I've also been taking advantage of the 30 day free trial of the Cloud+ Premium Services.  This subscription allows you to record and store your videos in the cloud, so you can review them later. You can also receive notifications on your smartphone or tablet when the camera's motion sensor is triggered. The notifications include a video link, so you can quickly watch the clip.

"There are many reasons why parents may swaddle their babies including:Regulate babies temperatureReduce the likelihood that the startle reflex will wake baby upHelp baby to feel more secure and safe especially in the first 3-4 months after baby is bornReduce excessive crying in young babies, especially babies with colic/refluxHelp babies to get the sleep they need for optimum infant developmentThe problem lies with trying to swaddle an infant with a traditional blanket.  The blanket rarely stays secure and it may be difficult to find the perfect size blanket for the task.  The Ergobaby Swaddler solves these issues and makes it safe and easy to put baby to sleep snug as a bug in a rug.One word of caution though - pediatricians recommend that ""If you swaddle the babies hips incorrectly, it can contribute to hip dysplasia,"" . ""But for the first two months of life, if you want to swaddle your baby, you can swaddle the chest area up tight and then make sure the area around the hips is looser. After two months, the baby does need to move around more. Otherwise, it could develop a flat head.""

"I've been using theBelkin QODE Ultimate Wireless Keyboard and Case for iPad for about a month now, and the final verdict is that I wish I had ordered this a long time ago.  It had essentially converted my iPad into an inexpensive, lightweight, laptop.  I use my iPad primarily for work and I was growing frustrated with trying to type emails using the onscreen keyboard.  So much so, that I found myself postponing my work until I could get back to my desk and use a real keyboard.  This have improved my productivity immensely.The only drawback is when I want to use the iPad as a tablet to read or surf the web.  When using as a tablet with the keyboard attached, the keyboard flops around and wants to drop open.

"I bought the Swingline GBC Fusion 5000L 12"" Laminator because I'm often in need of laminating personal documents and brochures and spec sheets for work.I don't need to use it every day or even every week, so I appreciate that the machine is fool proof enough to recognize pouch thickness and automatically adjusts settings accordingly to deliver the best possible results each time I use it.  Otherwise I'd probably be wasting a lot of pouches for not setting the machine properly.I also like that the machine warms up in 1 minute and laminates at 39 inches per minute - super fast laminating.  This saves a lot of time when I want to quickly laminate a brochure and head out for a meeting.  And speaking of rushing out of the office, the intelligent power off after 30 minutes of inactivity conserves energy and ensures that I don't burn the house down!And speaking of heat, the first couple of times you use the laminator it emits an industrial factory like odor, so be prepared to air out the room after the first use.  Or better yet, use it in the garage the first couple of times so you can avoid stinking up the house or office.One final note, if I had it to do over again I might opt for one of the other less expensive models since I'm not laminating large numbers of documents or brochures.  The 5000L is perhaps a bit overkill for my applications, but I still love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R94FEVHLZ5ZWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FFQRFS#wasThisHelpful","R94FEVHLZ5ZWU","AJ0HFDY5BB77Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0HFDY5BB77Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One can never have too much storage, and with the price of a 4TB drive below $200 the extra storage and capabilities are well worth the price.  Here are a few reasons why more storage on your desktop is essential.If you use a Mac and back up your files using Time Machine, your backup drive can fill up pretty fast.  When the backup drive reaches capacity, Time Machine starts to delete older backups to make room for new files.  By using this 4TB drive for your backups, you'll be able to store more files for a longer period of time before Time Machine ever needs to delete them.  If you've ever tried to find a file you deleted years ago, you can appreciate the advantage here.Do you take a lot of photographs?  With extra storage on your desktop, you can store all of your photos in RAW format.So, What are the advantages of raw format?All your conversions are done on a fast powerful computer at your convenience.Images can be 'fixed' in ways which would be very difficult without the raw sensor data.You get the full range of data from the sensor.Without sharpening or compression you have not 'lost' any data.You can change your mind about some of the picture settings after you have taken it.The downside of RAW is that they take up a lot of room.  A complex RAW photograph can be 24MB vs. the same photo in jpg may only be 1MB.  With 4TB of storage you can store approximately 125,000 RAW photos.Video files?  4TB will hold 480 hours of HD content.  That's a lot of video!As an added bonus, the Seagate Backup Plus 4TB Desktop external Hard Drive look really nice on the desk next to an iMac!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12S9P0BQ8Y6NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFRWWAW#wasThisHelpful","R12S9P0BQ8Y6NI","AJ0HFDY5BB77Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0HFDY5BB77Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perhaps my expectations were too high.  My intention was to use this bulb as a luminary alarm clock.  After all, the iPhone application allows the user to schedule the bulb to come on at a specific time and day.  The problem is that the application doesn't remember the color you choose, it just slowly powers on the light with the default retina burning sterile white light I've come to loath.  Also, the light had a very annoying flicker during the 10 minute warm up period that almost put me into convulsions.  I assumed that since I had set the color to a very warm reddish orange that when the light came on it would still be that color.  Nope.With no use for the flashing color strobe function (I""m too old for ecstasy fueled RAVE parties) I'm not sure what to do with this until there are some major improvements to the application that drives it.  I'd use it as a standard white bulb, but as I mentioned earlier it's not a ""warm white"" light, it's very white and sterile and not enough lumens to light a room or even read under.Even though it's more expensive, I'm probably going to go with the HUE from Philips.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGGB3MS2YYHKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXT2K8M#wasThisHelpful","RGGB3MS2YYHKZ","AJ0HFDY5BB77Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0HFDY5BB77Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm a man and I don't sew.I bought this to help cut up old blue jeans to cut into 2 inch squares and make char cloth - the blackened cloth used to catch a spark from a flint and start a fire.In less than 20 minutes, I was able to cut enough cloth to take care of teaching 20 kids how to make a fire without matches this weekend. Using a rotary cutter sure saved my arthritic hands!I see my cutter will cut all kinds of cloth, so this will get a big workout in my shop. Lay down a straight edge and get perfectly straight lines.Big surprise - got a man in your life that cuts a lot of cloth? Canvas, denim, vinyl for seats? Get him a set up with a cutting pad and rotary cutter!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39NQCX4C9VTQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IKIE4K#wasThisHelpful","R39NQCX4C9VTQK","A22DXDIYXPBVSP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22DXDIYXPBVSP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have NO idea what the balls this is advertised to be for, or how well it will work inflating them!I bought this as a fire starting bellows - only.It's light weight, fairly small and all one-piece, making it easy to pack and not even notice it's there. I prefer to use either a bow drill or flint to make camp fires. That requires blowing on an ember you create with one of those items. Camping at altitude (side of a bigger mountain), there are times you just don't have much spare breath for blowing on embers. Additionally, the air is shorter on oxygen. Exhale breath does contain oxygen, but also contains carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). This pump, in addition to saving breath, produces an air stream with a MUCH higher oxygen content and only the CO2 and CO from the atmosphere. That makes the ember grow hotter faster and gets a fire started much quicker.In addition to starting a fire, it will be great for re-starting banked fires from remaining coals. Just put fresh kindling on the coals and pump away.This would also be good for those with bad joints that keep them form kneeling down for blowing on embers/coals. Might want put a thin tube, secured with a small radiator style clamp) to extend the range if you have bad joints.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUYPWPVHH9YAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8RBC0O#wasThisHelpful","RUYPWPVHH9YAO","A22DXDIYXPBVSP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22DXDIYXPBVSP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can you say about a dust pan?Handle seems the least considered part of the design, but, dust doesn't weigh much and you won't be holding it long. It's not uncomfortable to hold, just seems a tad flimsy.The material appears to be just rigid enough without seeming to be brittle and not at all floppy. Non-porous so washing won't hurt it (removal of wet or damp residue). And, with all that, surprisingly light in weight.I've tried Rubbermaid in the past - too soft and seemed to draw puppy teeth like magnets, and some other brand (name not recalled) that was VERY stiff - cracked and broke. The old style metal ones I grew up with had a rubber blade where it met the floor - those always came off.This should last a good long time.

"Not something I need often in South Texas - we just don't have the giant trees found elsewhere. Occasionally we do have to bring down a larger Oak tree due to Oak Decline (a ground bug that kills the trees) and some of those can be large enough to need this - especially if the wind is not quite right for the direction you need to fell the tree.If you have little experience cutting down trees, plastic is the ONLY option for a felling wedge. Metal wedges are for splitting; they are narrower. I have used an axe or an old axe head (wider) but plastic will not kill your chainsaw blade if you hit it.I first tried getting the Husky set of three wedges, but the shipper never sent them. At least this shipper wants to sell their product.If you never cut anything larger than about 15 inches in diameter, It's likely you will never need this. Over 20-25 inches? Get them.

"I have bad knees so bending down on all fours to blow on an ember is NOT an option. But, if you don't have physical conditions like that, I could not recommend this to you.The air coming from the small end is just about perfect for blowing on an ember; enough to put good air pressure on it but not so much it will blow the ember away.So, if you like the idea and want it, go ahead and buy it. Keep in mind it is small and would be easy to misplace or even fall out of a shirt pocket.If you want one and wish to save the money, it may be possible to get an extendable pocket magnet, cut the ends off and use that. They are thinner than this item and would not produce the same air flow. You would also need to use a tube cutter to cut the ends off to avoid rough edges.Update:25 Aug 15I tried making my own from an extendable magnet from the harbor store. It was on sale for less than $5.The top (pocket clip) came off by removing a screw. I put the screw back in, part way, grabbed it with pliers and pulled out the threaded portion.I used a hacksaw to remove the lower end (solid), and discovered it was still solid. I removed about two, or more, inches from the bottom and that part was hollow.It worked - but I wouldn't recommend it.First, the lower section will go fully inside the collapsed unit. That is not a problem with the Epiphany Pocket Bellow. I have not tried to push it all the way inside (harbor store homemade model) to see how easy it is to get it back out.Second, there is a light odor of lubricant inside the homemade unit. I suspect it's to make it easier to extend because the unit is stainless steel and won't rust. No idea of the toxicity of the lubricant, but made in China so I would be leery of inhaling much of it or getting it into my mouth.Third, it is much thinner than the Epiphany model, thus easier to lose.Forth, my biggest concern remains with the short thinnest end. I suspect getting it stuck inside the rest (on the homemade model) presents the largest problem. For all I know, you could just give it a good shake and it would slide out - again, not gonna risk it.If you just want to go cheap, roll up a sheet of paper and blow through that. Yes, making your own from an antenna or extendable magnet IS possible, but not recommended. Neither is intended to be put into your mouth so toxicity should be a concern.I don't carry large sheets of paper or magazines when I'm camping, so for me, rolling up paper is not an option. I'll stay with the Epiphany.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EDA53QVJ2YII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDSW5BA#wasThisHelpful","R1EDA53QVJ2YII","A22DXDIYXPBVSP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22DXDIYXPBVSP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think $16 is a bit pricy for this item... a stick works well but would be more bulky with 100 feet of line.For me, the selling point was the replaceable razor blade. I generally carry at least one knife with me all the time. Camping, I take several - pocket knife, Swiss Army knife, Buck hunting knife, machete, axe and I have a knife in the glove box of the car. That being said, you just can't beat having a knife right where you store the line that needs cutting! Just unwind, slice and you are done.Lazy? Nope. I've been in situations when a sudden storm came up and putting up a shelter quickly was a must. A sleet storm is the worst but just plain rain is bad enough.

"Simple design, good and strong (1/2 inch steel plate), small and easy to store. Works with my tractor or a jack. Fits right in the tool box on my tractor so it's always handy (the bucket on the front end loader is one handy tool hauler when working fence and the tractor itself is a really great fence stretcher!).No front end loader? Use your 3 point hitch - I'm sure you have something you can hang a chain from that fits on that... box blade, trailer hitch attachment, quick attachment, boom, etc.No tractor? Any bumper type jack will work just fine.I have a fine T-post puller, the type with a stand, push down on a long lever. It's large, requires a stand (piece of lumber) for soft ground, requires much more storage space and often gets buried behind stuff in the shed. Yes, it works, but requires more effort and a lot more time and it won't pull mangled T-posts. I had a storm knock down a big limb from an oak tree that mangled two T-posts. The Speeco puller pulled them out, no trouble... and, since it was in the tractor's tool box, I didn't have to go back to find something else to use.Strong, easy to use and less than half the price of my old T-post puller - if I ever get rid of it, it's because I lost it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39PGR8LRMVAXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042U6DBY#wasThisHelpful","R39PGR8LRMVAXQ","A22DXDIYXPBVSP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22DXDIYXPBVSP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cutting ability of this item is similar to a Knipex 7101200 8-Inch Mini-Bolt Cutter. I've had one of those for several years for installing and repairing fencing (field and barbed wire), I've had them for about 8 years and they still work great. I paid $55 for them locally - on Amazon they have them for $43.89.I paid $8.18 for the Tekton. If you are buying for an occasional usage, one time fence install or have people you supply with tools that don't take care of or lose them, BUY THESE instead!I will have no trouble at all buying or recommending these again.I only used them for one afternoon of fence repair so I can't speak to durability of these cutters, but the edges still look factory fresh. I was cutting wire on field fence and the double strands of barbed wire (to go along the top of the field fence). Field fence has much thicker (and tougher) wire for the top and bottom run of wire. Regular wire cutters will cut the little wires on field fence but not the top and bottom wires.If you are used to tugging, wiggling while cutting or pulling with wire cutters, DO NOT do that with these. These are NOT wire cutters. They are mini-bolt cutters. They are treated to be extra hard so they can cut through tougher stuff than coat hangers. But extra hard means extra brittle so they can break from mistreatment. The WILL NOT break from regular cutting.I've also cut nails, screws and small bolts with this item to make sure it would do it. For me, if it will fit to the back of the jaws, it will cut. I did not try to cut any special metals like trailer deck screws, self taping screws or any odd alloys or non-steel items. I would have tried but nothing I had on hand would fit into the jaws. For $8.18 I was ready to risk it, but not drive into town to find and buy it just to test.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDKE0DYZD3B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NQ4OYO#wasThisHelpful","R3KDKE0DYZD3B5","A22DXDIYXPBVSP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22DXDIYXPBVSP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"okay, these shoes are very cute.. BUT.. first, I was sent a 6 instead of 9, but that's forgivable and not to big deal as I bought it on prime, so I exchanged for a 9.the 9 came and they were really tight. I mean, realllly tight.  I had to walk around with thick socks on for about one hour to get them to open up a little bit, but I was still literally losing circulation in my toes... and I've never bought shoes over a size 9. In any brand. I am an 8.5 to 9.  these were tight, but not that bad, except the toe area..  my toes were so confined and my poor toes were totally squished. And I am not a big girl, I weigh 105 pounds and have pretty narrow feet.if that wasn't bad enough, the glue where the shoes were put together turned yellow, being visible through all the little holes on the sides. Had they been more comfortable, I wouldn't have let the little spots bother me because they were so tiny and barely noticeable, but like I said, they were entirely too small, especially in the toe area, and a size 10 prob would be too big.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NHWIQTOLWGI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK6PMOA#wasThisHelpful","R1NHWIQTOLWGI6","A1NLYUU98Y245T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLYUU98Y245T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"my blonde color has completely grown and faded out, so basically it's a mousy brown color. no red hues, just a very ""dirty blonde"". well, I had no idea which color to chose bc I'm perfectly aware that they aren't going to be the exact color as on a computer screen. I ordered two colors that both just so happened to be on prime, and only one came close. the ""medium brown""- that had red hues.. almost an alburn color. but much too dark. no light strands at all.  it's for deep, dark, brownish-red hair.  then I tried ""chesnut brown"".. never would I call my color chesnut brown, but that matches pretty damn well. it's actually a shade too light, but it blends with my old highlights at the bottom.I'm not using these to lengthen my whole head.. just growing out an angle home hack job lol. these really help. I have thin hair anyway so their thinness isn't an issue. I just put them under my hair on the sides to equal it out with the rest of my hair. oh, for my whole head id probably need two. they aren't really sewn on the clips with too much care. they are kinda bumpy. also, I find sometimes the clips are tricky to close. compared to others I've tried. not bad for $25 at all though. they also tolerate quite a bit of heat. I've accidentally used my regular setting on my straightening iron and they did not fry.  I've sprayed them with heat protector and dry shampoo, because I don't really want to physically wash them unless I have to. all in all, I'm very happy I found them. I just wish the color would go on prime again so I could buy another set. I don't want to wait a month to get it from China only to find out it's a knockoff brand or the wrong color.  lol It definitely happens. hopefully by the time this set goes, because I'm only using half of the set at a time- I have the other half for another time, my hair should have grown out by then so I should not need more.

"other than the color being off, I was pretty happy with this.  The weft was very heavy, but nothing I couldn't tolerate.  and yeah it does tangle rather easily, but it isrelatively natural looking for synthetic hair.  I would have kept it had it been the correct color.  I ordered ""dark blonde"", and was sent dark blonde, but the color, to me, is a very light blonde.  I have no idea how they can call that dark blonde.  I have like a mousy brown hair, almost ashy, with faded blonde highlights.. almost a light brown.. and this did not match at all.  Not even close.  my hair looked soooo dark next to this.  it was weird.  anyway, I want to try a light or medium brown; maybe one of them will be a better color for me.  matching hair color can be quite tedious, and I don't  want to be out all the money trying to find a match, so I tend to only buy the ones on prime.  that way I don't have to deal with the hassle of getting an approval and then having to pay to return fee.  also, since the only other color even close is dark brown, I don't think I'll be buying another one of these.  if they had a matching color I would probably try it.also, one weft doesn't go all the way around your head ear to ear.  it's basically just for length in the back.  I had bought two, which I would have attached closer to the hairline onthe sides, and have them meet in the middle in the back.  these are also super straight and can't be curled.  so unless you have super straight hair, this won't blend for you.like I said, had they had my correct color, I would try this weft again.

"it's pretty much exactly what i expected.. except slightly smaller.  it's almost exactly 15"" wide (slightly wider), but BARELY 9"" in height.  it clearly says ten inches.  and yeah, it's only one inch.  but it makes a big difference in a foot stool.  ideally, I'd like it to be around 13"".  the bottoms of the screw-in legs have holes in them, so maybe I can find something to put on the ends to make it taller.  as far as the depth of the storage space, it's only 2.5"". someone had commented that it was 3-4"", but sadly, is not.  I'm still very happy with it, I just wish I had that extra inch in storage and in height.  what I wanted to put in it is ~3"", so now that's not going to work.  there aren't many others on here on prime, and I refuse to buy something over $10 off prime bc somehow I always get screwed, so I'll probably keep this.  I guess I have a month to decide.it's not flimsy at all.  I actually think it is very nice construction.  Maybe some others were damaged in transit?  I can also stand on it without any issues, but I only weigh 100 lbs. other than the height issue, it's exactly what I wanted and matches the decor of my room very nicely.  I have all cherry oak finish, and my vanity stool has a very similar pattern. So it looks very nice in my room.  if I find another that is slightly taller, I may return this.  Otherwise, I will keep it because it is exactly what I wanted.also, some people have stated that they were missing a piece at the bottom of the stool legs.. piece (A).  The instructions are pretty clear, and when you open the box, the four legs are in a bag inside of the storage space.  The instructions called the legs part (A), and tell you to screw them into part (B), that is the seat of the stool. As far as I know, there are no parts missing that should be on the bottom of the legs.  what they sent me matches the picture exactly.  if I am missing something, I would really like it because this is a very short stool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VG0X6X705WZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015AMEKS#wasThisHelpful","R2VG0X6X705WZD","A1NLYUU98Y245T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLYUU98Y245T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"these are really cute, but I'm beyond annoyed trying to get the sizing for this company (seven til midnight) correct.  I'm only 100lbs, and have 32"" hips and a small booty.  I'm pretty ""skinny"".  so first,  with a different style, I purchased a small (my normal size.. if not XS) and they were childlike small.  so I needed a medium. fine.  so then, I ordered these in a medium and they were huge.  they're a true medium.  I should have ordered the small size instead.  so basically, all the styles fit differently- which is why buying them on prime is best.  these were not on prime, but fortunately I can sew, so I cut them and sewed them back together to fit.these are cute, and true to size. I just wish the company would say consistent with the sizing.  oh, and you can't see the back.. they have a typical thong back.  no fancy ruffles or anything. they just meet at the top, resembling a ""T"".  very comfortable fabric, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3007369YUQVOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKPZ6GK#wasThisHelpful","R3007369YUQVOR","A1NLYUU98Y245T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLYUU98Y245T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm having trouble with the sizing for this company.  I'm only 5'5 and 100lbs (and basically no booty) and for many styles I've actually needed a M, when I'm always an XS with any other brand.  The styles I have bought before, the small is comically small.  so I ordered these in a medium, and they were too big.  a small would have been much better.  so this style i would say is true to size.  get what you normally wear.  they're cute, but what the picture doesn't show you is that it has a border of lace that goes around the legs and thighs.  it's also a thong.

"I love this TV. Great picture, nice big size.  I have to say that I am not knowledgeable about Smart TVs.  I called my cable provider (Time Warner) to come and hook this up.

I am completely satisfied but as I said I do have cable and I did get the company to connect this TV.Two things to be aware of--you need to have Internet at home to use this on the Internet.  In other words, build in wifi is kind of a misnomer--it only means this will connect up with the wifi you have.  Also--be aware the 50 inch measurement is diagonal--it's 44 inches across (as advertised).Looking for a complaint--I had trouble finding the remote the way it was stuck in the packing.

"I love historical fiction and I know this is by a highly esteemed novelist. It is obviously well-written and contains beautifully described historical detail.  It just did not draw me in as much as I hoped it would,  I did not care that much about the characters.

"The ancient world comes to life in this story of Cleopatraâ€™s two sisters, Arsinoe, still a small girl, and Berenice, a young woman who has overthrown their father and seized the throne of Egypt.  Arsinoe has reason to fear Bereniceâ€”as a half sibling she poses a possible threat and Bereniceâ€™s best move might be to murder her.  And Berenice also has reason to fearâ€”can she keep her throne, and fend off the Romans and her father?  The story goes from one sisterâ€™s third person point of view to the other's.  Arsinoe is the more immediately sympathetic character, but we come to sympathize with Berenice too, as she struggles to overcome her softer side and survive as queen.Cleopatra herself, eleven at the start of the story, is off stage through almost all of it, but sister Arsinoe adores her.  We do get a sense of her family background and of the dangerous world she lived in.I know how this story ultimately ends but found I was caught up in it just the same.  The palpable sense of danger carried me along.  The authorâ€™s prose vividly evokes the ancient world.  I am looking forward to a promised sequel that will carry forward the story of this family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUTHV4GUDMT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316382981#wasThisHelpful","R3TUTHV4GUDMT5","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book profoundly upsetting and have put off reviewing it, wondering if I even ought to.  It is a cry of pain about the history of black oppression in the U.S.  There is wonderful, painful evocative writing here.Iâ€™m coming to this book as the daughter and niece of NYC firefighters, who happens to live in NYC a half hourâ€™s brisk walk away from the site of what was the world trade center.  Twelve men from my local fire house died on 9/11, trying to save others.  The deriding here of what the author refers to as the firefighters â€œmachismoâ€ on 9/11â€¦what can I say about it?  That there is a great difference between machismo and heroismâ€”isnâ€™t that obvious? What can I say of his statement that both the police and the firefighters who perished on 9/11 to him were the fire?  I am struck by the fact that this author does not bother to distinguish between police and firefighters who after all have very different jobs (who is threatened by firefighters?).  He writes about these human beings but does not look very closely at them, it seems.  I hope he is never in a burning building, never has to understand viscerally the difference between firefighters and fire.Coates says he feels that firefighters are the same as fire.  Because he feels all whites endanger him?  (Many firefighters, by the way, are not white.)  He has the right to feel anyway he wishes.  But I was expecting something more from this author, something more akin to considered social analysis.  My major point:  there are distinctions this author does not make, is apparently blind to.He negates the fact that we have an African American president.  In his view, itâ€™s still pretty much the same here in America as it was in 1776.  When blacks were slaves.Read this book as a brilliantly written cry of despair.  Not as reasoned social analysis.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWRCY14GPGQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEFAIRI#wasThisHelpful","RAWRCY14GPGQ7","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was a lot of talking and ruminating about the protagonist's sister having been murdered, but I never felt involved with the story.  I skimmed a lot of the rest of the book.  The immediacy and the suspense and feeling of a life at stake that made BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP riveting was absent throughout as far as I can see.

"I enjoyed this book very much and read it very quickly.  A woman in her late thirties who hasnâ€™t had the courage to stand up for herself suddenly breaks outâ€”curses an antagonist at a PTO meeting and then decides to go off and confront the woman who was her best friend in his school, her teenage daughter in tow.  The friend rejected her in a particularly nasty way and Caroline the main character traces her shaky self-image back to that moment of betrayal.I was at the edge of my seat wondering how this confrontation would go, though I have to admit I sort of knew.  (Question:  Do you imagine the betraying friend is now a content human being?)  The thing is Caroline has a good lifeâ€”a really nice husband, an okay career as a photographer.  Admittedly she hasnâ€™t been as forceful as she might have been in many areas, including going after career advancement.  But sheâ€™s not bad off.  She was shy and awkward before her friend hurt herâ€”why does she think that event changed her trajectory as a person?  Well, there are other early life events she gets more in touch with.  But there is a fundamental lightness to this story which Iâ€™m sort of ambivalent about.  This could have been a deeper book.I feel the author wanted me to like Carolineâ€™s teenage daughter more than I did.  She was just too take-charge for my taste.  I wanted Caroline to show more strength interacting with her. The continual strength transfusion from the daughter and her frequent mouthing off annoyed me a bit at times.All in all, this was not quite a five star read for me.

"Several years ago, I needed to teach myself Excel and Access.  I turned to this Teach Yourself Visually series of books.  It didnâ€™t teach me everything about these two programs, but it sure got me started.  The bright pictures of the screens were the perfect learning tool for me.  Iâ€™ve been using an Android tablet and recently broke down and started using a smart phone, also an Android but from another company.

It will show you you're way around the icons and screens, how to find settings, how to make a call--very elementary things.  It answers more advanced questions like: Whatâ€™s the easiest way to share a video?  How do you backup the info on your phone? Depending on what your device is your screens may look a little different from what is presented here, but with two devices from different companies I had no trouble following alongâ€”theyâ€™re both Androids.

"This book is about how Dr. William Petit managed to survive and start a new life after his family was the victim of a horrendous crime--his wife and two daughters tortured and murdered.  It is a hymn to his resilience and worth reading for that. The author does not tell us much about the two murderers and actually avoids describing the murders themselves in detail.  Dr. Petit obviously has every right to feel whatever he chooses to.  But the author's disinterest in what shaped and motivated the killers put me off, along with what I took to be his lauding of the death penalty verdict in this case.  Dr. Petit asks at what point what the murderers' early abuse has to do with his family.  He campaigned for the death penalty.  As I said, he has the right.  But the author seems to echo his views without examining them or bringing any insights of his own.  Still I would recommend this book--it is an amazing story of psychological survival.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NX4UZ31JGIIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140162#wasThisHelpful","R3NX4UZ31JGIIX","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you were around during these years or know your history, of course there's minimal suspense about how things turn out, yet this novel holds the reader's interest, or at least it did mine.

"Okay, I'm a woman but I was tempted by the description of the scent and I wanted to try it.  It is really very nice--not an overpowering scent at all.  A particularly masculine scent?  I would say it is more unisex.  Smells sort of like talcum powder, subtly, once you dry off from your shower.  It is a pleasant effective body wash to use.  For the amount you get it seems pricey to me, however.  But it comes in a nice masculine looking bottle and I could see this making a nice little gift to a man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QGUVR91VXGQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCXS80S#wasThisHelpful","R3QGUVR91VXGQB","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was an avid fan of Shirley Jackson many years ago, thought I had read everything she wrote, but evidently not.  I was thrilled by this new collection. There are short stories, essays about being a mother, and reflections on writing. Some oft he stories like Paranoia are excellent. I would not say any of this is up to Jackson's very best work--nothing to equal her classic story The Lottery or her novel The Haunting of Hill House.  Yet it was a joy to read.  Some of it is dated and gives a sense of how far we have traveled since Jackson's too early death in the early 1960's.  I enjoyed even that aspect of these stories--as I do watching old Twilight Zone episodes.  These works were definitely worth publishing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38C2HNB9G7RPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997662#wasThisHelpful","R38C2HNB9G7RPC","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What made this book for me were the characters.  Despite the story being narrated in the voice of an autistic man, I felt I had a good sense of who the main characters were, and I grew to care about them.  This was particularly true of the protagonist himself, Todd, who is likable and sensitive.  He grasps essential things about people and about the nature of love, even though he can't full express himself.  The author gives him an original viewpoint,  Some of the descriptions are marvelously fresh.  I believed throughout that I was looking at the world as Todd saw it.  While regrettable things happen, the book is inspiring and affirmative rather than depressing, which to me is a plus.  Todd struggles with difficulties that would realistically confront a fiftyish autistic person in a supervised living situation--a hostile roommate, a new staff member who gives him bad vibes.  We wonder is he will finally get to visit his brother's family and if he will find a girlfriend, and root for him all the way.I was captivated throughout and highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRLE696GHWYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631490478#wasThisHelpful","RRLE696GHWYY","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautifully written book--the use of language is exquisite. However the pacing dragged for me at times.  It is told in two voices, that of an 18-year-old murder victim and that of the mother of one of her classmates. The mother had befriended the girl.  I found the dead girl's part of the book, ala THE LOVELY BONES far more involving than the rest.  Perhaps that was because Kate, the mother, lacks a compelling reason for solving the murder.  I really wanted and expected a suspenseful whodunit and found myself skipping pages to get to something exciting. This story was quite moving however.  I'm torn between 4 and 3 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVERXS0DZKMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617737666#wasThisHelpful","RJVERXS0DZKMN","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book held my interest but in the end I just didn't think the final twist was all that convincing.  The plot depends too much on a supposedly smart protagonist doing unlikely and irresponsible things. The plot depended on unlikely events.  I found the characters interesting, especially the two twins with contrasting temperaments.  The shifts in timeframe and point of view were a bit excessive--going into the head of a minor character named Angel seemed pointless.  It is well written and the pacing is good. But I was definitely looking for a climax with more impact and more of a believability factor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OGGXTC2B8O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062340077#wasThisHelpful","R20OGGXTC2B8O1","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a morally serious work that gives a good sense of the time and place, and of the tragedy of war.  At times however it was slow going for me and there were spots where the author had a tendency to show not tell.  For example, introducing an important character there is a third person narrative description of her as â€œsharp-tonguedâ€ and in another case a character is described as â€œhumorless.â€  A more experienced novelist might have shown us these traits, perhaps through dialogue.  I was not as involved with the characters or with the story as I would have liked to have been.  Still, the historical material did interest me a great deal.  I liked the fact that we were able to see World War I through the eyes of a German as well as through American eyes.  I do recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JXXOI65YB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149260383X#wasThisHelpful","R26JXXOI65YB0","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It takes courage to be vulnerable and, especially for someone who teaches spiritual principles to others, to be that open.

"I read this book in one day, because I was absolutely engrossed.  Hanna and her husband are attacked by intruders.  The husband dies, but Hanna, who survives head injuries, can't remember if her grown daughter and her boyfriend were the murderers.  All evidence seems to point to the boyfriend but there is a real question about whether the daughter was involved.  Is Hanna refusing to see the obvious?  Will she figure out what really happened in time to protect herself from another murder attempt?The novel asks us to examine the ways people deceive themselves, and how that leads to evil consequences.  It's a more psychologically sophisticated and reflective book than the usual thriller.  The characterization is deft.  The writing does not call attention to itself; it is clear, easy to read and direct but never insults your intelligence.Overall, I thought this book was excellent and really had trouble tearing myself away from it before I read the last page.  I wouldn't call it flawless--what book is?  Personally I flinch at any reference to cruelty to animals. That part wasn't graphic here, but it wasn't necessary in my opinion, and in a book I read to be entertained, I could do without it. The bit with the dog just left me feeling sad.  Also the ultimate answer to the central question comes not so much through the actions of the protagonist as through the breathtakingly stupid behavior of another person.  I don't want to give spoilers but I found that one plot point very hard to believe.  Hint:  It involves a newspaper article.My five star rating does not mean perfect.  It means despite my quibbles I consider this one of the best books of this genre I have read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3463XKER7NRSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554073#wasThisHelpful","R3463XKER7NRSW","A359D655P5XEU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A359D655P5XEU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There have been no signs of mice since then.  Is this due to the repellers?  I suspect so.  I really hope these work because the only thing that has gotten rid of mice in the past is using traps.  I hate the cruelty involved.The repellers each have a small night light which stays  on all the time.  I don't mind this at all but I suppose some people would.  Each takes up a whole light plug.

When I received this paint brush set, I immediately noticed what a nice, high quality case the brushes come in and every brush has the plastic head over the bristles to protect them.

These handles are wood and seem very sturdy and well made, the brushes are even and well made with no stray bristles coming out while you paint or at any other time. They clean easily and work well.

It is a thin material, but is fine for an inside play tent.  Very cute and easy to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2982K1AOO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7RJLUU#wasThisHelpful","R1K2982K1AOO6","ADS99W8WMEXZ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS99W8WMEXZ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I only had a couple of stray hairs with the first use, which is normal with any new paintbrush.  Other than that, no stray hairs left on my canvas.

"I have been using the Polar Loop and HRM for about 7 weeks now.  I've given it 4 stars because it works well.  First of all, don't be duped into buying the pads & gel.  You don't need it - it works fine without that stuff.  Also, initially I had difficulty getting my loop synced with the Bluetooth HRM.  I would put everything on and then try and retry to get the loop to pick up the signal from the HRM.  What I learned after trial and error is, put the HRM on first and after a moment, put on the loop. The first time you press the loop button it will greet you and automatically pick up the loop connection. Easy.

"GREAT - Works great, fits great, and stores great.This softhood bonnet hair dryer is so convenient and works great.  The 40"" hose attaches to your hair dryer at the blower area.  You chose your heat setting from your hair dryer, so if it feels too hot or cool in the bonnet, adjust your hair dryer setting.  The bonnet is large and easily fits over curlers without squeezing them into your head.  The adjustable chin strap keeps it in place during use.  There is a drawstring the tightens the bonnet around your head so the heat doesn't escape. My mother and grandmother use to have one that looked like a piece of luggage and was very heavy.  This fits into its own little zippered carrying pouch about the size of a make-up bag.  I was offered this at a discounted price to try and then review with my honest unbiased opinion.

"Peppermint oil is a very versatile oil for body & home.This large 4 ounce bottle will last a long time. It also arrived with a glass eye dropper. It is 100% pure and natural therapeutic grade.I have been using peppermint oil for a long time for headaches, stomach aches and nausea.For headaches apply a few drops on your finger and massage into your temples and along your hairline in the back. Usually within minutes it is gone.For stomach aches and constipation rub a drop or two right onto the abdomen and massage in.There are many uses also for the house/garden area. My favorite that I use is putting a few drops onto a bandana and tying it around my upper arm or through my belt hoop. This has really helped to keep the insects (gnats, flies, spiders,etc.) away.

"Very nice design.  Mounting hardware is okay.  The wall anchors would not grip the drywall and one of them fell through!  Luckily we keep metal wall anchors in our hardware supply.  The light is above average.  We have a table top LED vanity mirror and this one is brighter.  The plug in is a USB port style adapter which is interesting.  Wonder why?  Overall a very nice mirror.  Would have received five stars but the mounting hardware was not up to par.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S39SECKB451/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDD9AQU#wasThisHelpful","R3S39SECKB451","A1GRCUWE8SA3TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GRCUWE8SA3TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: I sent this back for a refund.  The stink was just too much!  I replaced it with a LowPro, Format 120(That does NOT stink)I bought this bag for my EOS M with the EFS to EFM adapter, and Canon 10-18mm mounted.  It is a good bag, and has just enough room for the eos with the lens and adapter mounted, and room to put the 22mm pancake lens in the front.The bag seems well made, but the gripe I have with it, is that it has that ""New Chinese Plastic"" smell.This might seem like something silly to get hung up on, but I already own several bags for all my various equipment from both tamrac, and lowpro, and not a single one of them has that smell.  This smell I am taking about is very strong, and you can definitely notice it.  It will really clog up your nose.It also has an oily feel that gets on your hands.  Not something I want when I am changing camera lenses...Still not a big deal?Well the big deal to me is I bought this more expensive bag over a 20 dollar ""Case Logic"" bag that I liked, but had that smell, Thinking  the Tamrac is probably still made in China, but yet has better quality control, I ordered this."" Chinese plastic smell"" is a real thing.  Don''t believe me?  Type it into Google.  You will find lots of info on it.  You usually find it only in cheaper products direct from Chinese companies.Too bad, because otherwise, it is a nice bag...This is a little tongue in cheek, but I really wish we would go back to the American way of having our goods manufactured in Mexico....","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GVLSKL6OBK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P43IGY#wasThisHelpful","R11GVLSKL6OBK2","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This allows you to make use of your other canon EF and EFS lenses, as well as a new lens like the EFS 10-18mm, which I find excellent for the EOS M, although it destroys the small form factor of the camera...This is available now for a  FRACTION of the previous cost, so you might want to pick one up her on Amazon.The efs 10-18 is about half the cost of the EFM 11-22mm, and you can't use the 10-18 without this piece of hardware...It came in a simple white box.

"I needed a wide angle lens for the eos m.  I have the 22mm Prime, but that doesn't cut it in some situations.I find that this lens works well with the EOS and the EF to M adapter.  So far the lens has sharp focus, and believe it or not, it seems better than the 22mm EFM that was made for the EOS m in focusing speed, and accuracy.The Good :The lens is sharp, accurate, focus is quick, and silent.  The Image stabilization works very well. I can't tell you how many stops, because I have never needed to use IS for still photos.  I use the IS for video, and it seems to help keep down vibrations, and jarring.The Bad:No focus number window!  One reason I wanted this was for long shutter night time shots of the stars....Summary:For the price, this lens is a great addition to our EOS M, along with the adapter.  It is MUCH cheaper than the 11-22 EFM that is made for the EOS M camera.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It slightly defeats the purpose of why I bought the EOS M in the first place, but it isn't that much more to lug along. I plan to use this lens just for the EOS M, as my other camera has a full frame sensor.Other lenses and cameras in my kit:  70-200 F4L, 17-40 F4L, 35mm Prime, 50mm Prime. Canon 5D, Canon 20D, 300HS, Hero 3 + Black, Hero 4 BlackI could talk about vignetting, and barrel distortion, and edge to edge sharpness, but the only one I have ever really cared about is Chromatic Aberration which is VERY well controlled on this lens.  The lens is also very sharp.You can easily fix vignetting, and a lot of the times, you crop out barrel distortion, so that isn't a big deal to me.P.S, I am not going to try and act like I am some sort of nuts and bolts photography expert, but I do know a little about photography.

"I was asked to review this book.I find this story to be a very unique, original, and enjoyable read, with some minor flaws.The flaws:There are numerous grammatical errors sprinkled throughout, the book, but not so that it is too distracting from the story.  There was a line that read something like, ""Jasputin felt like he was in a room of physicists discussing particle physics""  There is no way Jasputin could feel that way.  He is a dog...  ""Jasputin might as well be in a room of people discussing particle physics"" or something like that would work.Problems in Character Development:I understood Caroline, but I didn't get why she was the character that was so important.  What in her background made her so smart? So willing and able to take the lead?Lucian was kind of like a ghost character.  I didn't get why he was there at all.  His character didn't really make sense.Dr. Fourer was another one that wasn't all that important to the story.The Good Character Development:Most of the characters are rich, and easy to empathize with.  All the main characters, like Caroline, are people you can relate to.As I said, Caroline was well developed, although maybe a mismatch.Rashid was well developed.Erin was a rich character.Aaron Sr, was very vivid.Murphy was the kind of person you would expect.Cody is someone I understand, and don't like...Which is the way it was intended I think...The ending:Everything is wrapped up well enough for me.  There is a part in the end that is just a little over the top, but the book wrapped up nicely.  It didn't leave me with questions, or irritation.Overall, I found this a very imaginative, well executed story, besides the few flaws.  It was very enjoyable, and I can recommend it to sci fi fans looking for something new and original.It was a satisfying read.Mark :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQ342OGEVHWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508677034#wasThisHelpful","R1UQ342OGEVHWO","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These batteries provide plenty of flight time, but they age extremely rapidly, even under ideal treatment..I never have kept my batteries charged, and have kept them at around 50% unless I was flying them the next day.  I would commonly charge them the day off..Even so, my experience is that they don't last long, and I have read they are good for maybe 50 uses from reputable sources.  I have 31 flights on my one battery, and it is already down to 92%.  You really should be REAL careful about flying a battery that has less than 90% capacity.  Even 89% is a no no.Don't believe me?  Watch Micbergsma on youtubes video of his battery failure of a battery that has 33 flights on it, and 89%.  It is up in the air for 25 seconds, and he gets the red flashing low battery warning, and auto land...Brand new batteries don't get hot when you fly them.  You can tell your battery is starting to age(in addition to locking at the status on the Phantom assistant software) by seeing if it gets hot when you fly the quad.DJI is making money hand over fist on these!  Think about it.  If a new battery cost 129.00 and is good for MAYBE 50 flights, that is 2.58 per 12 minute flight!  It would be cheaper to take a drive in the car, and burn the gas.....I say 12 minutes, because that is the longest I fly my quad.  I fly it until it reaches 50% charge.I don't mind paying 129.00 per battery, but that price for a battery that only lasts maybe 50 flights is ridiculous!PS. I have lots of experience with Lipos.

"This is an excellent lens.  It is sharp, and fast.  Meaning it has good optics, and a low F2 number, for great low light performance, and bokeh.The lens is a macro, with a minimum focusing distance under half a foot!

"The camera came updated with firmware 2.02.  Even with the new update, the camera still has major issues with auto focus.  It is not a lack of speed I am concerned about, it is inaccuracy.  I would say about half the time, or more, the camera gives me the little green squares indicating it has achieved focus, only to get back the computer and discover the focus was off...I would much rather have the camera indicate it couldn't achieve focus, rather than give me an indication it does when in fact it does not...Auto focus:simply does not work well at all.  It is rather pathetic.  A lot of the time, the focus squires turn green on several areas, but the image is not focused.Image quality:This is where the camera really shines!  When it does in fact get an accurate focus lock, the images can be stellar!Battery Life:Although I have taken quite a few pictures, and video snippets, I haven't had a chance to really test out battery life.  However, I took this on vacation, and took several video segments, and had no issue what so ever.Video Quality:When you are using manual focus, you can get some truly stunning results.Body and build quality:Excellent!  A nice sturdy metal bodyMenus/touch screen:Rather non intuitive.  The camera probably has every option you would care for, but they are all buried deep in the touch screen menus and not easy to get to...  When I looked at customizing buttons, I learned I couldn't do what I wanted, which was to map white balance to the asterisk key.Summary:  If the auto focus was more accurate, I could easily give this 5 stars.  However, the auto focus is terrible.  I don't find it too slow, just inaccurate, and that is a fatal flaw in a camera.If you want to see the video review with sample photos and video, click the link below...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFWa0axLivQ","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ZXK7KC3ES1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2A1KEC#wasThisHelpful","R9ZXK7KC3ES1M","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:I HAD TO GRUDGINGLY GIVE THIS DEVICE ONE MORE STAR, AS MY WIFE WAS ABLE TO PUT ON THE HEART RATE MONITOR AND USE WHILE SHE WAS STRENGTH TRAINING WITH FREE WEIGHTS...I was sent this device to review by MeasuPro.  Although I have tested a lot of excellent products from them, and one that was also mediocre, I have to give this device only 3.5(4) stars for the reasons I will list below..One, the instructions for this device are very poor.  There is no clear instructions on what to do before putting the heart rate monitor on before it will read correctly.  There is a vague line that talks about ""wetting the electrodes"" but no description of what the electrodes actually are.  I had to look into how a chest strap heart rate monitor works before I understood how to make this one work.Two, It is unclear exactly how to set the speedometer for accurate readings, and figgity to get working..  It should just be a matter of entering in the proper wheel diameter in order to get an accurate readout. Let the computer do the calculation for circumference.  Or at least list that is the reading you want.I mounted this on a mountain bike, with road tires that were on 24 inch rims.  That should have been a measurement of 60.9 centimeters.  With that setting, the speedo was WAY off as compared to the gps speedo on my smart phone.About the heart rate monitor:There are four components to the heart rate monitor.  The main sensor that has measupro silk screened onto it, two conductive rubber side straps(Electrodes), and the elastic strap that goes around your back.  You need to wet the underside of those straps/electrodes(the part that sits on your chest) before you put it on.After you get the underside of those rubber pieces wet, the heart rate monitor continues to operate accurately.  I compared this to the heart rate monitor on my smart phone, and they both agreed.Features:This device is loaded with good features like, Kcalories burned, heart rate, miles, etc.  For the price, it is a pretty full function device.Speedo:I spent quite a bit of time fighting with this to get it to operate correctly. In the misunderstanding that I was to calculate wheel diameter in metric and then enter that in. Probably over 20 minutes...  If i entered in the proper wheel diameter converted to centimeters, it was WAY off.  I could get close(within 2 -3 MPH) at 11mph by just using the default setting of 207CM.  I lastly figured out the device wanted me to enter in circumference in centemeters, or at least that is what I think it wants....  On a 24"" wheel, with the tires it should be around 210CM.There is really no instructions about this, and it really isn't intuitive...  I have another, more expensive bike computer by Sigma, but one shouldn't have to have experience with bike computers to use a new one.  The manual should be written in a way that anyone can learn how to install and use this.Quality:It has the feel of a quality product, and a full two year warranty, but the trouble in setting up the speedo takes a notch or two away from the device.  The speedo is necessary to determine calories burned and distance traveled.On the plus side, I did contact them about the heart rate monitor not working and they did respond via email fairly quickly, although the reply really wasn't much help.Summary:I spent quite a little bit of time fighting with this device.  The directions aren't clear, and it isn't intuitive on what to set.  I do have another, more expensive bike computer on my road bike, but it has been a while.  Better instructions would make this a much better device.As it is, it probably is worth the money, if you can figure it out.  I hope this helps!The video review is below, but I spent so much time dittling with this thing, that I was not happy with the video review results.  Neat GoPro scenery though....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqtUoucq0wk","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JFCKKE89NTJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNKAE0A#wasThisHelpful","R2JFCKKE89NTJC","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This gets 4 stars for such a bizarre storyline.  Sure I guessed it with 33 minutes to spare, but that didn't make the last 33 minutes unwatchable.This story gets a good helping of bad reviews, but what really interested me in watching it, was a 3 star review that said ""I don't know if I liked it, but I was still thinking about it days later"".  I am a sucker for movies that leave a lasting effect like that.Although you can guess it before it has ended, that doesn't make the story simple.In other areas, the acting by all the characters is great, and the execution of the story makes you feel for the characters.I think the reason this movie gets a large dose of bad reviews is it makes you think.

"This is a quality kit, with pretty much everything you need to get started.  You have I think the more useful, practical components in this kit, Like a photoresistor, and temperature probe.The kit is quality, there is a neat little plastic tray that your Arduino and breadboard fit into. The trim pot and all other components are suited well to this kit.It has a 9 volt battery adapter to power the kit.You go to the Arduino website to download the program interface that allows you to upload your custom code to the device, as well as downloading sample code directly from the Arduino site.This is a good little kit, and I find the kit pretty complete for learning how to use the Vilros.  I have another kit that is made by another manufacturer that has more/different components that doesn't seem as high of quality.It has a custom tray that the UNO board mounts to, and that the breadboard sits in making it easy to keep your work neatly organizedI think between this kit and some others, I would pick this one to start learning on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYHEK151JKNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT0NDB8#wasThisHelpful","R3LYHEK151JKNE","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some pros and cons to this kit.  I would say it is more like 3.5 stars.I will go over the cons first:1.  The real Arduino kit has a longer USB cable, which makes it more convenient than this kit.2. I like the tray that comes with the real Vilros kit.  It makes it easier, and neater to build projects.3. The jumpers fit more snuggly/precisely into the breadboard that comes with the Vilros kit4. I would like a temperature sensor in the kit.  I find that useful from the start.5. The Vilros kit comes with an adapter that plugs into the board so you can use a 9Volt battery to power itPros:1.All the example code, and data sheets are provided for you right on the cd that comes with the kit.  That is BIG plus, it keeps you from having to go out and search for the data sheets.2. This comes with more components for the same price as the true Arduino kit.  Check the listing.3.  I really wanted an gyro, which I think makes this kit worth it.  I am not too interested in the dot matrix display, nor the LCD.4. The tutorial booklet is much larger, and easier to read.For a learning kit, this is probably better, as it comes with more devices.  However, for making a circuit that is useful that you can just leave in the tray, I think the Vilros kit is probably better.In general, the Vilros kit has a more quality feel, however, it doesn't come with near the same components for the same price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGNQY73S10VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D9NPP1E#wasThisHelpful","R3RGNQY73S10VP","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SETTINGS FOR THE DX6i WITH EITHER THE 350qx3, or 350qx with Version 3(350qx3) FIRMWARE AT THE BOTTOMI have the original 350qx upgraded to version 3.0(350qx3 firmware), and would like to take you through the changes I have seen in the way it flies from version 1.The differences between V1, and V3 are mostly in the Firmware that controls the craft.  The main hardware differences are, that the GPS antenna is in a mast that sticks up from the craft, and that there is a slightly larger battery in it.The four stars I gave it is in reference to the firmware characteristics and flight improvements over versions 1, and 2My experience:I have much experience with the 350qx.  I have crash landed mine because of mostly unresponsive controls, from wind, and from vortex ring state.  I have had it apart many, many times. In all that time, I have only cracked two motor mounts in one of the pods.  It is still flying on the original body, and I replaced two motors(Horizon sent them for free) originally from the start because they were noisy, and one later, because it got sand in it.  I have spend a quite a  few hours shielding the controller and gps board from interference from a camera and have gotten it to the point were it would position lock in 25 seconds with the original firmware.  I have replaced motor bearings, and put a ""how to video up that is sponsored by Boca Bearings(type The Suburban Hippie Experimentalist, into youtube)My flight vehicles:I have an Ebay gimbal, Mobius camera, CNC prop adapters, and an FPV transmitter  installed on the 350qx.  I also have a Phantom 2, with a Tarot T, V2, and a Gopro Hero 3+ Black installed. and a Nano QXEvolutions in firmware:Version 1: ""Smart"" mode( the mode were you don't actually have to know how to fly, or think. If you push left it goes left, no matter which way it is facing). It also has altitude hold when in smart mode.Stability Mode, (the mode that has position hold, no altitude hold, and everything else flies as normal, meaning you have to know how to fly, and ""put your head in the craft"".Agility mode(without 6 Axis stabilization. You can do flips and rolls, IF you can fly it)Smart mode in version one worked okay.  When I first got the craft before I shielded everything, it lost GPS signal all the time. Of course this problem was throughout all modes.Smart mode worked as advertised, but it is basically useless to teach you how to fly the craft.Stability mode was my favorite.  It had position hold and 6 axis gyro stabilization, but it was quite jittery when flying around.  The controls responded to any SLIGHT movement, so if you have shakey hands, like after drinking a few cups of coffee, it will be ugly..Agility mode was not for me...Version 2 firmware(350QX2):Every mode was the same as above, except they added ""AP MODE"".It flew barely okay in AP mode, but it could NOT maintain altitude very well at all, nor could it position lock very well. A slight wind would blow it all over the place. It was a neat idea, and looked good on paper, but was a crash waiting to happen.Hardware changes in version IIThey also moved the GPS antenna into one of the back arms to get it away from the center of the craft, and any camera you had mounted. They also added a slightly larger battery.Version 3 Firmware(350QX):All modes are the same as version II, with the exception that stability, and AP flight modes are much improved!AP mode works better.  It holds altitude BETTER, but not perfect, and also does a better position lock, and Stability mode is less Jittery, more smooth, and more confidence inspiring. There is no bobbing around, like there was before version III.The hardware changes were that they put the GPS antenna in a mast that stuck up in the center of the craft to get it away from any camera causing interference.  From what I have read it is much improved, however, after shielding mine with copper tape, I have no issues..The 350qx3 AP combo also has longer flight times, over both the V1, and V2.  I think because the gimbal is lighter.With Version III firmware, this is a much better air vehicle than it was.Add the 3 axis gimbal, and CG02 in the AP Combo and I think you have something.The 350qx3 AP combo is quite a bit cheaper than the Phantom 2 vision + Still I have to be honest, with my experience with both, my preference is still the Phantom 2 over the 350QX , which has a longer light time and is more stable.HOWEVER, THERE IS A BIG ISSUE WITH THE PHANTOM 2 with the zenmuse gimbal for GOPro, WHICH IS THAT THE ZENMUSE 3 AXIS GIMBAL IS JUNK, AND CAUSES ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS...Cons of the Phantom 2, Vision Plus:The Vision plus has a VERY fragile gimbal. I don't know if the 350qx3 AP gimbal is less fragile, but it is about 300 dollars cheaper than the Phantom 2 Vision +, so perhaps if you break the 350qx3 AP, it is less of a a strain on your pocket book to replace...About Fly offs:  I believe some Phantom 2s are flying off on their own not caused by user error.After all the experience I have had with the 350QX, I DO NOT believe they are flying off due to anything else BUT user error...  perhaps people are flying them up too high, and the wind is CARRYING them off, but I am sorry, I do not believe they are flying off on their own, due to firmware malfunctions.At least that has been my experience with firmware Versions 1, and 2.P.S, I have never had ANYTHING fly off, whether it be the Phantom 2, or 350QX.Of course, I keep them both on a pretty tight leash, and don't let them get too far away from me....  I always make sure I can tell the orientation, and have full control.  If not, I bring them down.  I have had to bring them down in the distance, and crash land them to make sure to not risk a ""Fly off"".I had crash landed the 350qx lots of times, and the Phantom 2 once. In all those crash landings, I have broken some props, and cracked one motor pod on the 350qx, and the only damage I ever sustained on the Phantom was a broken prop, and burnt up motor due to a tip over(which happens all the time).The downfall to the Phantom 2, is that it has not automatic shutoff, if the props come in contact with something, like the 350qx does.  That means if it tips over, you likely just burnt a motor up...I sincerely hope this helps your decision process!DX6i settings for 350qx3.  First watch the horzon video on how to set it up.

"UPDATE THE NEXT DAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW:This isn't a bad speaker.  The speaker is rather directional, so that if it is at your level and pointing right at you, the highs and mids sound much clearer.Too be clear, the mids, and highs sound much better, more real, and less jarring than the 1.5 watt auvio blue tooth speaker.  However, surpisingly, the bass response from the much smaller auvio 1.5 watt is much better!  Overall, you get more volume for mids and highs, with less bass.  The 1.5 puts out great bass for it's size, and actually has more bass punch, because it has a down firing subwoofer, but the mids and highs are piercing to me.If the shack, were to combine this design, with a down firing subwoofer, instead of a bass port, they would have really have something.As it is, it is a good speaker for what I paid for it on sale at the Shack....About the connection notification:I seriously don't know what people are complaining about...  There is a voice telling you the speaker is on, and once again when you are synced on blue tooth, but it is NOT loud at all.  I would say mid, to low volume.Overall, I am satisfied, and even though the bass response is better on the little one, I find this speaker will be less jarring for what I wanted it for, which was to listen to music when I am going to bed....UPDATE AFTER A DAY OF USE:I HAVE RAN THIS SPEAKER THROUGH SOME TESTS, WHICH ARE ON YOUTUBE. TYPE IN ""The Suburban Hippie Experimentalist""Now, having said that, I have found that after a day, I have really started to like this speaker.  I think you will be very pleased with it for everything except Hip Hop music, which really relies on the lower bass scale.  That R&B ""thump"" everyone loves will be the only genre were you will find this speaker missing something...Playing music from your computer, or phone through the AUX in jack sounds GREAT!  There is enough bass for most music genres, and the sound from the speaker, is very nice, clear and fills the room with enough volume.Every speaker/ receiver system I own, has distortion when played through blue tooth.  I think it is because of digital clipping.  Which means the A/D is less bits than desired, and or some math is done that clips the music in such a way that you end of getting harmonic distortion at the receiving end.Hope this helps!

"As the title says, this speaker is quite exceptional for the size, and weight of it.  I bought this for 40 dollars at the Shack.  It sounds much better than its size would indicate to you, with GREAT bass for the size, and good bass in general.  It works fine for what it is, but the mids, and highs don't sound as pleasing coming from such a tiny driver.It gets five stars for what it is, but I am not sure I actually like it...Price:For the price Amazon lists, I think it is not bad.  I WOULD consider it too expensive were it not for the blue tooth function.Design:The design is very good.  As I said it delivers exceptional bass for such a small device.  Much more than you would expect!Sound Quality:After you get past the astonishing bass this device puts out for its size, you will start to think about the sound coming from it.  I would not describe it as pleasing.  The bass sounds good, and has a semi rich sound to it.  The part where I think this falls short IN MY MIND, is the highs, sound too sharp coming from such a small driver.  The highs are clear enough, but when you are listening to this on your bed side, the highs are a little startling to you, and aren't something that will lull you to sleep. The mids are fairly absent.  You get highs, and bass.  It is probably fine if you want to listen to this while you cook, or watch a movie.What I don't like:If you are using the 3.5mm Aux in jack, there is not volume control as the buttons on the top of the speaker do not work.  You have to set your volume on the playing device.  If you have this set full blast on say your laptop, the speaker comes on full blast.Summary:I am on the fence about taking this back.  I am not sure I like the sound.  Sure it sounds great for what it is, but I am not sure if I would prefer a bigger device that doesn't have such piercing highs.About me:I am a former Audiophile.  Now a days, I am less picky, but I still know what good sound sounds like.Video Review:I did a small, unprofessional review of this on one of my youtube channels using a sound analyzer I downloaded on my phone.  Just go to Youtube, and type in ""The Suburban Hippie Experimentalist""i will also put a link in the comments section to the video.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MVQM49ULGU84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZDDUTS#wasThisHelpful","R1MVQM49ULGU84","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say this phone is pretty cool.  My first foray into smart phones was with the Samsung Stratosphere(silde out).  These phones easily broke on me TWICE.  Both times they were in my pocket.  The first time, there was no visible damage, but I must have leaned up against something.  The second time. It was in my pocket and I bent down.That was if for me and smart phones, until I discovered how cheap Virgin Mobile was, and that this phone(LG Volt) was on sale for 149.00 with no contract.I  have to say the phone is pretty neat.Battery life:I fully charged this phone 24 hours ago, and now it has about half capacity left.  I used it to download a few apps, and used it as both a gps for about 25 minutes today, and for Rhapsody.Actually, it can drain the battery MUCH faster than that...  It was at 100%this am, and 7 hours later it was at 50%...Features:It has almost all the bells and whistles, and some that other don't like the Quick Remote, that is pretty cool!  It works like a charm on my Toshiba TV,  I don't know for sure, but I am thinking the LED just under the camera lens must be capable of transmitting infra red.The phone has a quad core processor in it, so it is pretty fast.It has the Google 4.4(kitti Kat, I think)  The google search tool works flawlessly for me with voice.  you click it, say what your looking for and google finds it, and you can then get gps directions to it.  Simple.Really what makes an android smart phone useful is all the free apps, and there are thousands for you to download.Size:The phone is very thin, and light. and about as wide as you have come to expect for a smart phone with a decent sized screen.performance:As stated, the phone is pretty quick to open your apps.I am on Virgin Mobile, in Carroll County Maryland, and so far, I have not had issues with data connectivity.Minuses:I don't find the menus all that intuitive.  I often have to use the back button several times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLAPU3SMI5RDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8CS9OO#wasThisHelpful","RLAPU3SMI5RDG","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was sent this to reviewI find this scale to be pretty accurate for my needs.  The only reason it looses a star, is because if you turn the scale on, and don't use it, it tends to drift a few grams.  To measure very small weights, you need to turn it on, wait for it to say zero, and measure it right away. I am not certain that other scales do not have this problem.Apparent build quality:The scale is very light, yet seems to be pretty solidly built.  It has a stainless steel plate on which to weigh your items on, and the UNIT and Power/Tare Button are neatly fit into the face besides the display.Accuracy:I do not own calibrated weights on which to test the scale against, so I used US coins.  I found the weights on the US mint sight, and weight them.  Although they probably aren't exact as they have been in circulation, possibly picking up dirt, or having some of the material rubbed off, they are as accurate as I could find. I find the scale to be accurate generally within .5 grams in most cases.Usefulness, and range:I find the range to be phenomenal on this scale.  Especially for one so cheap. One that will measure between a few grams to 11 pounds is pretty impressive.Warranty:A two year warranty on something like this that cost so little, and could possibly be abused is pretty impressive to me.Recommendation:If you choose to buy this scale, and want to measure heavy items(like 11 pounds), I recommend that you are careful to not slam the item down on the weight table.  This is a plastic scale, I doubt it is a good idea to let something pound down on it with more than one G of force.  For example, just a two G drop on 11 pounds weighs 22 pounds.  Dropping something from just a few inches can easily give you 5 gs to 100s of gs or much more depending on the surface it lands on.The point is, don't drop you weight on the table....If you want to see this scale in action, and see how I determined this scale to be accurate, go to Youtube, and type in ""the suburban hippie experimentalist"", and look for the TZ5000 in my videos. It should be up within a few hours of this review..Hope this helps!Mark :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28MF86ZE4TM50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK3VRCC#wasThisHelpful","R28MF86ZE4TM50","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for firmware 2.0.  I already have a review of the 350 Qx on here.  There I gave it 4 stars largely because of Blades great customer service..I have since upgraded my 350 Qx with firmware 2.0.  The only differences in my original 1.0 350 qx, and the version 2.0 would be a different placement of the GPS antenna.  With the version 2.0, they moved the gps receiver and antena to the right back arm in order to attempt to get it away from the interference.A little background:My original 350 Qx flew fine after I replaced the noisy motors, WITH THE EXCEPTION that it did not acquire GPS with the Mobius camera I was using.  When I tried, the quad would always take a long time to acquire GPS, and ultimately, it would loose some control, so I would have to bring it down for a hard landing.I had to come in sideways once, and the quad struck hard as it was flying from the left, and rolled several times, making my camera fly off, and bending the attachment hardware.Months of experimenting, and moding:It took me quite some trial an error to get the mobius shielded from the GPS antenna and reciever, but I at last did it!After upgrade to 2.0:Then I was enticed to upgrade to 2.0 because of how useful the AP mode seemed on paper...Unfortunetely, it does not work quite like advertised.In AP mode, the design is that you must take the throttle up to at least 75% to raise the quad, and everything below 50% lowers the altitude.  Everything in the middle on the left stick, is supposed to keep the quad at your set altitude.However, it doesn't quite work.After you set a height in AP mode, and fly forward, the quad quickly loosed height.  You can't reasonably feather the throttle like you can in stability mode either.Also, with version 2.0 sometimes the throttle cut doesn't work the first time I push it, which is troubleing for me.  I want the ability to ditch the craft if it tries to fly away, or over people, but now throttle cut is unresponisive.The other issue is that the start up procedure doesn't always work well either.The throttle cut, and start up worked perfectly before upgrading teh firmware.I will be anxiously awaiting firmware 3.0!I have some videos I made with the quad on youtube at my ""mark daniel imaging"" channel.The thing that this quad REALLY has going for it, is that it won't fly off on you!  In firmware the firmware one version, It would occasionally, or even often get a gps error, and make it fly funny, but I always had partial control, and could bring it down.Could a strong wind blow it off course, and if you weren't profficient on the controls would it float away?  Sure.However, with the DJI Phantoms, I have seen clearly automated flight, where the quad flys off, like it has a mind of it's own.  Good solid robotic flight that take that quad away from you.  There is a saying, ""it's flying back to china""The 350QX won't fly off, but be prepared to work on it. Tune it, and such.Hope this helps!Mark","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1P9SF2HR4ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8T8EO8#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1P9SF2HR4ZM","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this thermometer to review.I am still using this, and loving it quite some time after my initial review.We have had several meat thermometers over the years, and none of them even come close to the TF5000.It would normally be hard for me to get excited about a meat thermometer, but this one is pretty advanced.Upon receiving it, I immediately checked it for accuracy, and found it to be right on.To check accuracy:A. First I put a bunch of crushed ice in a glass of water, and measured the temperature.  I got a measurement of 32.5 degrees almost instantly.B. I then boiled a pot of water, and measured the center to be 212.3.  Again almost instantly.Speed of Measurement:The package says it has a 6 second response time, but I find it to be almost instantaneous.  All my other thermometers took forever to read the meat.  Long enough that my hands start to feel uncomfortable from the heat...Accuracy of device:Judging by my experiment, I find this device to be right on.Calibration button:The fact that it even has a calibration button is impressive to me.  I have never owned a thermometer that you could do this with. To do this, you crush ice, and put it in water.  You stick the thermo in the ice water, and hold the cal button for 2 seconds.  It will read 0.0 C, which is the freezing point.  You have just calibrated your thermometer.Max/Min button:The max and min button tell you your extremes.  I can't currently think of a use for this, but perhaps real chefs can.Auto Power Off:None of our other thermometers have had this feature either, and I always end up leaving them powered on laying on the countertop, draining the batteries.Reliability:I haven't had this long, so I can't really comment on that, but I can say the device has a nice solid feel, and seems to be made well.I hope this has helped you in your shopping!Mark:)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8XGY75WDQFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB8K85S#wasThisHelpful","R1H8XGY75WDQFM","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This prop reamer works flawlessly, and I would think it would be a lot easier to manage than what most people use to ream out the props for their 350 QX with the Small Parts, CNC prop adapter.Be careful when using this, as in plastic props, this can take a lot of material away in a big hurry.  Only apply very slight pressure, and ream the props out just a little at a time.Ream the props, check fit, ream the props, check fit....If you take too much material from the hub of your prop, no matter how well balanced the prop, you will never get smooth flight, as the prop will end of slopping to one side when you tighten it.This item is very sharp, very solid, and works very well.Good luck!Mark :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GS1S8AD1XPH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DZE5FW#wasThisHelpful","R3GS1S8AD1XPH1","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The battery balance connector is too short to put the battery in the bag and let the balance connector stick through the bag to charge it.

"A BIT OF HISTORY...This makes my third, and probably last quadcopter...My intention before buying any of my quads was to do areal video with a 350 sized quad.Before shelling out the money, I got the SYMA X1, and mounted a camera to practice areal video.  After about a month with that, I bought the 350QX over the DJI Phantom.After flying the 350 a few times, I decided that if I was going to fly such a capable, and expensive device, I really needed to hone my flying skills so that in the event the 350 tries to fly off, I can take the reins so to speak' and place the 350 in agility mode and fly it back to myself.The Syma was too big and clumsy to fly inside, and too small, and symmetrical for me to fly outside with any hope of determining the front and back of the quad, so I needed something really small to fly in small distances inside.The Nano Qx seemed to fit the bill.  It was either that or the Estes Proto X, and the Blade product won out, since you can bind it to a regular transmitter avoiding the only complaint I have seen about the Proto X, which is that the controller is useless.MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE NANO QX:I am happy that I chose the Nano QX.  It is everything that I wanted it to be.  It is very small, very precise, and light enough that when you crash, it doesn't break itself.This little quad is really quite capable and precise.  At first, I flied it in Safe mode, with low rates with my DX6i controller, then moving on to Safe Mode, and high rates.This quad is small, light enough, with the durability needed to fly it very aggressively in my small living room, which is exactly what I needed.  I plan on flying this very aggressively in a tight area, to learn to fly well.  I plan on flying this flight learning tool, much more aggressively than I will ever fly the 350QX.  The idea it to learn to fly really well in case I ever need the skills on the 350qx(video machine)Agility mode inside is a bit much. Perhaps if one had a huge room, with high ceilings, it would work but I think for that mode, you might just want to fly it outside...Charger:The provided charger is nice.  It is small, and the battery just fits right into a socket.  You just plug it right into your computer USB.Spare Parts:  It comes with two canopies, a yellow and a green, another set of rotors that match the color of the other canopy, and like 4 spare little rubber grommets that are used to hold the body in place.  I am not sure about spare parts like motors and such, but will most likely have to replace those things at some point.  When I do, I can see that there is no soldering required, which will be nice. Plug and play motors will be much appreciated!STABLE HOVER:It requires just a little trim to tune into a hover, but otherwise it is a GREAT flyer.  I will learn to be an expert flyer with this little guy.TIP:With the DX6i, it is said that you need to bring the flap switch down and back up to get it to go into Agility mode in the manual.  For me, I have to just switch the flap/gryo switch down to (1), and leave it there.  When I tried to flip the switch down and back up, the led on the quad turned red, but only the throttle and yaw worked(left lever) and not the aileron(right) lever.Other than that little hiccup, nothing else.Hope this helps,Mark","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349S623FSYD10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYHZTDK#wasThisHelpful","R349S623FSYD10","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was REALLY underwhelmed with the quality of video this puts out.  I had an 808 #16 that seemed to take just as good of video inside, and actually BETTER video outside...This camera had all washed out colors, with a preference toward the blue,  Meaning white balance was way off, in a snowy environment,  As compared to the 808 it was really poor.  The 808 recorded true colors without any bias towards any hue.The picture is sharper across the entire frame than the 808, but I just can't live with the fact that the white balance was off.I liked the image stabilization and that is why I bought it over the Hero.  Also, the image quality looked batter to me than the hero.I bought it to mount it to my newly purchased quadcopter, but it was just WAY too much work to mount for such lack luster video quality.  That and even when I turned ""Remote(wifi"" off, it still seemed to interfere with the GPS of the craft.I really hate to say it, but I returned it, and bought a Mobius direct from the manufacturer.  We'll see how that compares.I really wanted this camera, with image stabilization, but I just wasn't happy.FYI, I had downloaded the newest firmware, and was recording at 1080, 60 frames per second.There is a video I just uploaded on youtube.  Just go to google, and type in ""the suburban hippie experimentalist"" to find it.Hope this is helpful...","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HYYKNGEUHYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090EC5MS#wasThisHelpful","R39HYYKNGEUHYK","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE, I FELT IT WAS FAIR TO COME BACK AND UPGRADE THIS FROM 3 STARS TO 4.  THE REASON WHY IS AT THE VERY BOTTOM.I ordered this over the Chinese competition, for a few reasons.A.  I did not want to give such a large amount of money directly to a Chinese owned company,B. I did not want to have to TRY and deal with Chinese customer support if I had issues.C.  I did not like the toy looking transmitter of the Phantom.D.  I wanted a real hobby grade transmitter.C.  I wanted to support and American company,E.  I have heard Horizon Hobby customer support is ""second to none""I open up the DX6i  transmitter box, and I am happy.  It is what I wanted, a big, complicated, computer transmitter that reminds me of my hobby days 15 years ago.  I feel like it is a precise tool, not some toy. Inversely, I open up the box on the 350Qx, and am not so impressed.  It is smaller than I imagined, and has kind of a cheap feel to it. The light weight, brittle plastic body is someone flexible, and two of the motors make clicking sounds when you spin the props(rotors).I watch a couple videos online to see how to program the transmitter for the 350qx, and I am flying it in about an hour.SMART MODE:  The Smart Mode does what is says, by making it so you don't have to remember what direction the craft is going.  You push the stick to the right and it goes right, regardless of which direction the vehicle is facing.However, in smart mode, it feels like the quad is fighting me.  It is sluggish to respond, and doesn't do what I want it to.  It flies rough, and you can see that on the video camera.STABILITY MODE:  In Stability Mode, the craft flies like you would expect.  For example, you need to keep in mind the orientation of the craft versus where you are.  It flies responsive enough, that you can fly it just fine though.AGILITY MODE: I have not tried Agility Mode yet.  I am not as skilled as I would like to be, and don't want to risk a crash.RETURN TO HOME MODE: Return to Home mode is something that I did try, and works perfectly.WHY DID I RATE THE CRAFT AS I DID?The reason this craft only gets 3 stars is that it came with two motors, with bad bearings that introduces a lot of noise into the vehicle, and makes poor video. The reason it didn't get just two stars, is that I called Horizon Hobby, didn't have a long wait time, and spoke with Chad, and without any fuss, he is going to ship me two new motors, free of charge of course.DID YOU TRY IT, BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW?I have done some experiments with video, and I find the front mount is problematic for a camera as heavy as the Sony AS15.  It makes the vehicle tip forward, and try to fly away from you. Also, even though I had ""Remote(wifi)"" turned off on the camera, it still seemed to interfere with the GPS.DO YOU HAVE ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THIS REVIEW?I have a few videos I put up on youtube, if you want to type in ""the suburban hippie experimentalist"" into google, you can see them...SUMMARY:For now, I am satisfied.  Even the next day before I called Horizon, and was considering sending it back, I still didn't want to by the Phantom. I will keep it, and use it, and in the future maybe build my own, if I need to upgrade.WHAT IS THIS 350QX INTENDED FOR?This thing I am sure will fly circles around the Phantom.  It is more of a hobby grade flyer, whereas the Phantom is more a strict video tool.Hope this helps!UPDATE:One major thing happened that made me change my mind on how happy I am with this quad.  One, I called Horizon Hobby customer support.  I called, I was on hold for about a minute, and then I did the option to leave a call back number.  I received a callback in about 3 minutes.  I spoke with Chad. He was very nice, helpful and understanding.  He said it was no problem to ship me two new motors.The second thing that happened is that, without me asking, they rush shipped me the motors VIA FedEx.  I got them on a Saturday, which if you get things delivered to your house, you know that is kind of rare, and cost more.The third thing that happened, is after I replaced the two new noisy motors, I began to play with different camera mounts.  I have discovered which modes work best for what.  Without a gimball, and camera anti shake, Smart Mode is not the best for video.  Stability Mode however, is useable.Because of those three things, I have decided I am in fact happy with my purchase.  There are some bugs to work out, but now I am confident, that it will be no problem to get the results I want.Although the two motors I was sent, or quiet, I  have decided that I will probably upgrade the motor bearings to ceramic ones from Bocca bearings in the future.I have also ordered a Mobius camera, and will get an 89 dollar gimball off of Ebay that unfortunately is from Hong Kong(I would rather buy American, or at least Japanese)Based on my bad experience with the Sony AS15, and my good experience with the 808 # 16, and ordering a Mobius over the Sony, it isn't so much about money rather than trying to get stuff that works right away.  The Mobius gets great reviews, and the seller of this 89 dollar gimbal gets 99.3% feedback.I REALLY HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT I THINK THE CHINESE ARE ACTUALLY STARTING TO BEAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IN QUALITY.  Seriously, that hurts to say, but I think it might be true...Mark :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VWS1ZO8G1D85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUW8VJM#wasThisHelpful","R1VWS1ZO8G1D85","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"However, there is a higher than normal defective rate with this quad, and also A LOT of returns due to the poor user manual.REVIEW:Let me start by telling something the manual doesn't.  HOW TO SYNC THE CONTROLLER.The manual isn't very clear on how to bind the transmitter to the quad.A. Put the battery in the quad and set it on a level surface to calibrate level flight and leave it there until after the quad LED starts to blink in rapid succession.B. After you see the rapid blinks start on the quad, turn on the transmitter and watch its led blink for a few seconds.C. take the left control and push it all the way up to the top, and then quickly back down to zero throttle. The light on the controller should now be glowing solid, as should the led on the quad. It should be ready to fly! Enjoy!Now that the above is done.  Let me tell you about the quad.There are lots of people on youtube that are thrilled with this little guy, and rightly so!  It takes little time to get to learn how to fly it.Low and High Settings:In low level or ""L""  you will have a tough time flying this in any wind outside.  In ""H"" or High level you should be able to fly this no problem.First try to learn to hover and control it inside in a large room on L mode.  learn to hover, and move the quad around within say a 5 foot diameter inside.  Learn all the controls and then take it outside.Cons:They make these cheaply(selling them for around 35 dollars), and there are some quality issues.This isn't so much a toy for untechnical kids or adults because of the quality issues.However, since there are some quality issues, as they slap these together cheaply, if you don't want to look at the board, or know how to solder, you are stuck! Look at the WLtoys 9X9 series.MY USE:I ordered an 808 #16 camera to mount on it, and use it as a video platform. In the future I intend to step up to one of the large quads like the Horizon Hobby 350qx, or the DJI phantom.MY EXPERIENCE WITH RC FLIGHT:15 years ago, I had a 60"" nitro powered  Trainer, with a .40 nitro engine, and two electric HobbyZone Firebird IIs.  I really enjoyed flying the 2 channel firebird II planes.I did enjoy those electric planes a lot, and it got me outside.  After I became busy, I sold the two Firebirds, and whished I had kept them ever since.MY CONCLUSION:I am quite pleased with this.  Despite the quality  issues(cold solder joints) it works quite well.  I think the toy is quite advanced for the money(3 axis stabilization, the motors shut off if the bind to keep you from burning them up, and the replacement parts are quite cheap)Hope this helps!UPDATE TWO DAYS AFTER OWNING THE QUAD.After just two days, and about 5 flights, I have learned to hover this quadcopter in mild winds(say gusts of 5mph) outside, and keep it pretty stationary to maybe a 15 feet x 10 feet rectangle area, which pleases me.  Gusts are the hardest to manage, because it is constantly changing.I have learned to pretty easily keep the copter oriented to what direction I want it in so that I know which controls to push.When the battery gets low in the quad, it slowed the propellers and landed landed,UPDATE AFTER A WEEK OWNERSHIP; To be honest, I had to come back and take two stars off the review.  This thing is great while it lasts, but when it breaks after a week like it did with me, your going to wonder if you have a fine enough tip on your soldering iron to fix it.You can get replacement parts for this pretty cheaply,  a control board for 9 dollars, and motors for 2.25 a piece.UPDATE AFTER A MONTH.I ordered 4 new motors, and a control board form banggood.  I replaced the bad motor, and the quad flies, and hovers like new again. I can now hover hands free at any engine speed. I have 3 other motors, and a control board, so I should be able to keep it running for quite a while.I think I am just going to keep it.  After everything I have done, I am somewhat attached to it now.  I have made a custom carrying case for it, and it all fits in neatly so I can hike with it to a destination.IF YOU WANT TO SEE A VIDEO I DID, TYPE Mark Daniel Imaging into google, and look for ""3 Days of Hiking in Snowy Maryland"" on youtube...Mark :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFU8425PEJUE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00906PKQ4#wasThisHelpful","RFU8425PEJUE1","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is interesting.For those who read this and think ""this type of fumbling wouldn't happen today"", you are sadly mistaken my friend...Our federal government isn't good at handling/managing ANYTHING.  There is so much red tape, and so much lack of motivation to do work, that it will seriously take a year to do something that should take at most 2 weeks.  I have experience in this.Have you ever heard the saying ""good enough for government work""?  There is a reason people say that..Not just my experience working for the government, but also my experience growing up as a military brat using military health care has shown me just how stupid and inept the government management can be.For one because the establishment is so massive, and two because it is run by politicians who are really concerned with furthering their carriers.If a disaster would happen today, you can count on a few things:1. First, if the government didn't have to tell you, they wouldn't.2. If they did tell you, they would say ""they are still assessing the situation"", but at this time there is no need to panic.3. Then they would consistently tell you things aren't as bad as you think. An example of this is during TMI partial meltdown, they said there was no radiation leak, and that it was safe to come back to you homes in the area.  Even while Jimmy Carter visited the plant, at the same time, there was a huge hydrogen bubble growing inside the reactor that they didn't know how to deal with, or if it would explode(if it did, it would be game over for the surrounding area).  Look it up if you don't believe me.4. The response to actually manage things would be very slow. Once they started to ""manage"" things, there would be great areas missed.Think Katrina.I am not trying to tell you to hide in your bunker down in your basement. In fact, I recommend getting out and enjoying life, and remembering that you can't control everything, or even a lot of the things you think you are managing.However, after reading this interesting story, maybe store a few weeks of food and water in case you have to shelter in place,  and if something happens, do not wait for authorities to tell you to leave if you can.Be ready to think, and act on your own.I guess as a book review goes I should be talking more about the writing of this book, and less about what this book is really about . How the government delt with a very serious threat.Well, the book is an interesting, enjoyable read.  It really gives you insight into how the government has worked in the past, and show it still works.It makes you wonder a little about how safe you really are, and I think this book is well worth the read just to open your mind.Beyond all that, it is a good, intricate story.Mark :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YMC0MII9IC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385495226#wasThisHelpful","R22YMC0MII9IC6","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tea deserves some rave reviews. This tea has a delicious fruity smell, and taste on account of the bergamot oil I presume.MY EXPERIENCE WITH TEAS:I am not a tea expert, but I have to say out of all the different teas I have tried(including many brands of Earl grey), I find this tea to be the absolute best Earl Grey, or even the best tea I have ever had.I have tried all the fancy teas in the regular, and organic grocery stores, and I have to say when I first tried this tea, I was in for a little surprise.HOW DO I DRINK MY STASH EARL GREY?The tea is good by itself, but great with just a little whole sugar, and half and half!WHY DO I DRINK TEA IN THE FIRST PLACE?I often drink tea instead of coffee to cut down on my ever present caffeine addiction.  Yeah I love coffee, but it can get way out of control if I don't watch myself!Also, there was a period where I drank nothing but tea with two tea bags at a time when I couldn't drink coffee for a while because for some reason, the coffee gave me indigestion, and tea didn't.AM I A TEA DRINKER?I can't say I ever really ""liked"" tea in the past.  It was just something I drank when I either wanted just a little caffeine, or if I wanted a hot beverage with no caffeine that wasn't so sweet.HOW DID I FIND THIS TEA?Stumbling across this tea that is a standard black tea that tastes 10 times better than the fancy fruity teas was a pleasant surprise...WHAT ARE SOME OTHER TEAS I LIKE: In the past, I have enjoyed Red Rose tea, which I had always liked much more than standard Lipton tea(I know they are now made by the same company) and I liked Twinnings, English Breakfast tea.For non caffeinated tea, I really like rooibos.  I really can never get enough red bush.....This Earl Grey surpasses them all in my opinion!  It is delicious, and with less than half the caffeine of a cup of coffee, I don't have to feel guilty or jittery if I have 3 or 4 cups in a day.This by far has become my favorite tea!Mark :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNY1A2KR2828/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D4MYAY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNY1A2KR2828","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me probably over 20 years before I stumbled across this group on youtube which brought flooding back some memories of my youth, and how I felt in those days.The quality of the sound of Hangin on a string, and Slow down, is an excellent resampling, and I can play the songs the way they were originally intended.  On my huge, Mach II speakers with thier 15 inch woofer drivers, through my excellent quality receiver of around the time when this song came out!For those of this day and age, you may not understand what I mean, but your Ipod, small speakes of the day, and cheap and poorly produced amplifier may not do these songs justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJPYYNUWIZSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000095SKX#wasThisHelpful","R1NJPYYNUWIZSD","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A REAL survival story!This is an exellent docu/drama.  It tells the true story of Jewish families that with thier strong will, self reliance and innovation were able to survive long term living underground in two caves to evade persecution by the Nazi occupiers in the Ukraine.This isn't some hollywood sensationalized story of a thrill seeker that just made an accident.These people were fighting for thier lives from the start.  They did not go underground for any other reason than thier basic need to survive.This movie was good from start to finish.  I like the duel formats.  The movie starts out as just a documentary, but then evolves into some dramatizations, with narration from the real survivors of this ""adventure"" for lack of a better word.The movie has a great ending, and some enlightment about how our neighbors can act in the real world.  I also liked how those indomitable people were able to pass on some perspective to thier grandkids.On another note, it is good to see another side of the Jewish people of that time, which is a group of strong, smart, and self reliant people that beat the Germans.  Instead of just the countless hapless victims that had no hope or way of protecting themselves from an overwhelming wave of only what I can describe as ""evil""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7B5NG0EPDKN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENYL3F0#wasThisHelpful","R7B5NG0EPDKN2","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is an intricately woven story in this book that turns out to be less of a thriller, and more of just hours of boredom.. Reading through detail after detail that goes no where.I would give it 2.5 stars if I could, but this is really isn't quite a 3 star book.Do I really need to know all the mundane details of how Indy is fed up with the liberal judges?  Not really.A little back story about Youseff enables the reader to understand his character.  However, on and on and on and on it goes....Hours and hours of painstaking work of the TTIC combing through every detail to try and find the terrorists.  Is this a manual on intelligence, or is this supposed to be a novel?I did enjoy reading about Turbee.  His story was interesting.  There was a real sense of Drama with that character, and I was interested to see what happened with him.In fact, all the character development was great.  It was just way over done, to the point that the reader was no longer interested.There really is nothing compelling or engaging about this book that makes the reader wish to keep turning the pages.I wanted to like it, I just couldn't.  Kudos on the character development, but there is just to many mundane details.Shorten the book by about 300 pages, and you might have something!Mark","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTRORN7J25Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA0MYVO#wasThisHelpful","R1FTRORN7J25Z2","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would say this is one of the best books I have read recently, and it was FREE for the kindle.I would give this five stars, but for the ending being wrapped up a little too neatly for my taste.  For a free book, it deserves 7 out of 5 starsThe story:The story idea was excellent!  It took an important topic from our daily lives and made it undoubtedly sinister which adds to the fun.  I would say the story idea was one of the most interesting I had read recently.  The idea that there could be an intentional plot to destroy the human race with GMOs is fascintating.The writing:The story flows very well, and the writing was right on.  I did not find any irritating errors in grammer or spelling that I can remember.The character development:Excellent!  You really get a feeling for what makes each character tick.  The characters are rich and well developed.  You know Jack like he is an old friend.  The reader even gets a feel for minor characters like Richards, and Renee.  Both of those two have interesing personalities that give the reader a vibrant mental image of who they are.Excitement level while reading:Not a complete page turner, but defintely not boring either.  There were only two parts I skimmed over.  Maybe a page or two, when I didn't really want to tolerate mundane details while I was in the midst of a ""cliff hanger""The ending:There really wasn't anything wrong with it.  It just seems like one moment you are in the midst of the excitement and then next thing you know, everything is wrapped up neatly with no drama at all.  Kind of like ""they lived happily ever after""  However, there is a sequeal that I just downloaded, so I guess the ending can be forgiven.Summary:I really enjoyed this book.  It gave me hours of entertainment.  I think the story line is EXCELLENT!If I didn't have a kindle, and had paid the price for the print version, I wouldn't have been dissatisfied with my purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GEZ9UBZDNQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MME1RU#wasThisHelpful","R16GEZ9UBZDNQ5","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is hailed as part Science Fiction novel, and Part Philosophical Exploration.Forget the former, and go with the later.As a novel of any kind this is a poor representation.  The author should have just stuck with the Self Help Genre.This book is written at a elementary grade school level.  Let me try to explain.There is no real character development in this book.Instead of trying to lead the reader to what kind of person any particular character might be, it is almost like simply telling you. Arnold Wheeler is bad.  The plant manger is good.There is an accident in the mine.  The plant manager says ""Oh my God, those men may die. We must do something""  Okay, I can see that the plant manager is a good man, however, no one talks like that..  In fact, in America if someone said something like that, the other person would think they the person who had said that was being sarcastic...Oh and then Arnold Wheeler shows up...  The character doesn't try to hide his lack of concern, but basically says, ""just let them suffocate"" to paraphrase.Plant manager Ken Good.  Arnold Wheeler Bad...There are numerous Grammatical errors in this book that could be over looked if the story was good.  In this case, the grammatical errors can't be ignored.The dialogue between the characters is frankly ridiculous.  No one talks like that.Gayle "".....I can assure you Feminine Energy is real""Arnold ""I do not doubt that there is such a concept as Feminine Energy""Arnold "" I also do not see how what you are calling authentic feminine energy is any different than pure animal instincts""The words feminine energy is written 3 times within one small paragraph... It is like the reader is expected to have no attention span, and keeps forgetting what the characters are talking about...In this book, Gayle writes another book, and the title of the CHARACTERS book is mentioned 4 times.  ""FULL FEMININE POWER""Then we get to the orange planet in one of the multiverses.  An interesting concept.  Only one color with infinite different shades.  Of course the dialogue between the characters is just as bad.This is a very simple story that is irritating to read.The author really should have just stuck with the Self Help Genre.  Of course, I wouldn't have read it, but there wouldn't have been this poor review from an avid reader of Sci fi books.I understand from some of the reviews that there may be some people out there that are interested in this type of subject, but that doesn't make the book a good sci fi novel, or even a novel for that matter...Mark :)","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3VAF3YHGCA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBO241Y#wasThisHelpful","R3A3VAF3YHGCA7","ABKUJX7YJZ3DA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABKUJX7YJZ3DA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"System stats: Milled Aluminum Case  i5-6200U -2.4 ghz processor  8 GB ram  64 operating system  built in touchpad and Bluetooth connectivity, speakers  Comes with Windows 10  SD Slot - HD Video Slot - 3 USB Slots  Pros:  Very light weight  Responsive touchpad  Great Sound  Nice Screen resolution  Cons:  It would be nice to have been slightly larger so as to have DVD drive  There's a lot of power in this little package.  It has a stylish clean case and housing. Edges of case around touch-pad are polished for a pop to that area of case.  I have found that it is so polished, that a bit of felt on and edge of case to keep it from slipping out of note-book bag would not be a bad idea.  As for operating software, runs great!!  I do architectural design work and it seems to run software like Sketchup and basic cad very well.  I have a home network and it connected right away with little effort.  Also, as a bonus it didn't come loaded with gobs of bloatware.  The one exception being Dropbox, but I use that so it didn't bother me.  Battery life seems to hold well.

"Times sure have changed. I remember the day when people carried a map and a compass for navigation, and in case of an emergency, we had matches and maybe a flare.

Sometimes it's a 3000mAh or 8000mAh or maybe the 12000mAh. Just depends on how long I'm going to be in the store or if I'm going hiking or on vacation.To charge it, I put it in my home office window.This one is a 8000mAh, not as fast as another one I have at 12000mAh, but this one still charges pretty fast.

"Very nice and feels like premium quality material. I did not observe any flaws. It fits very well with it's elastic band it fit my small head and my husbands big melon..lol without feeling tight.There is hardly any chef who does not wear a chef hat. It essentially conveys a professional appearance and also adds a sense of completion to a chefâ€™s uniform . Sometimes, a chef's hat typically identifies the head chef. The taller the hat, the more experienced chef is considered to be. The pleats in the hat are known to convey the chefâ€™s expertise. Traditionally, chef hats used to be aesthetic but these days chef hats are in demand because they are comfortable and functional.This chef hat is made of 65/35 Poly cotton material which allows heat and moisture to escape. The brim of a chefs hat absorbs the sweat and prevents it from dripping on the chefâ€™s face or food. It gets pretty hot back in the kitchen. I used to work at a restaurant and have been in the kitchen, you can expect heat over 100 degrees and moving around like they do, doesn't help much either.*Poly cotton is a fabric that consists of cotton and polyester fibers. The most common ratio is a 65-percent cotton and 35-percent polyester blendThis chef hat would be a great present for the culinary graduate as a house warming gift or for just at home for yourself.Overall, I feel this Chef Hat is a great buy, affordable, premium quality made and I recommend it.â–ºi received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone or in any way of my opinion of this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16QNG40KDXXDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017KNAI2Y#wasThisHelpful","R16QNG40KDXXDG","A3RH3HS2KBTJMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RH3HS2KBTJMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had to do a lot of weighing stuff today. I'm starting up my hobby and it requires me to weigh stuff. So I had a field day using this awesome scale. Battery didn't die out, it held up great.

"What a life saver. We have a water dispenser in the house and needed something for the shop. When my husband seen this he immediately said ""this has to go in the shop, i could use this."" So we went and filled the 5 gallon water bottles and he put one in the shop. The water tasted a little like plastic at first, so you might want to fill a bowl with hot water and run it through the pump a few times. After that you will be good to go.The components are made of a durable thick plastic and very easy to put together. There are 2 longer plastic tubes that you need to put together to make the long tube a whole. It all seems to be holding together pretty well. The pump presses with ease and the water disburses easily with each pump.We are absolutely loving this. Works well, durable and glad we have it.Great for home, office, garages, shops. Also would be great for at any sports practice.'i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7M3UBIE01KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q9H9DCO#wasThisHelpful","R3E7M3UBIE01KR","A3RH3HS2KBTJMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RH3HS2KBTJMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:54 Mins This is amazing. I've had this for a little while now. My grand daughter finally came over so I could show her this amazing projector. She was mesmerized by it. In fact she was up really late playing around with it in the dark. She fell asleep with it on. She's just a couple months over 8 years old and was able to work the projector without any issues. I showed her once and she was good to go.The way the colors seemed to dance on the wall keeps you watching for hours.This projector would be a nice item for a babies room. If you put some lullaby music on and put it so baby can watch the colors dance on the ceiling baby will be asleep in no time at allThe projector is very quite when you don't have the music set up, so even just running it for the color show would be perfect.And since it's white, you could probably even do some type of crafting on it with babies name.I was trying and trying to pair it to my phone then my tablet and it would not pair. So, when my husband had a chance to help me, we figured out that it does in deed NOT have bluetooth capabilities. Even though the about says that the speaker is easy to connect to any of your android or iOS devices through its auto pair bluetooth feature that pairs your device. There was no bluetooth symbol on the box nor does it have a suction cup attached or that came with the projector.  It came with an audio cable and usb connection so you can plug it into your phone, tablet and wall or computer.They do offer a 100% LIFETIME GUARANTEE. It appears to be durable, affordable and with proper care, it should last a good while. I will come back to update if I find anything wrong later onOverall, it's a really nice night light projector. I like that it shuts off after an hour and the color show displayed on the wall is beautiful.

" 3:12 Mins Pineapple slicer/corer's make coring a pineapple so much easier and fun. I the one I have already is a lot better than this one. I don't feel this pineapple slicer/corer is made very well. This one has a sharper edge around the bottom part, which cuts into the sides of the pineapple. I am not sure if it's suppose to take out the middle part or not, but I kind of like that my other one doesn't. I like being able to surround it with fresh strawberries, melon, grapes and more.Be careful you don't cut yourself, as it has very sharp edges towards the bottom.Overall I like it, but I don't love it.

" 3:03 Mins This battery charger is really great and fast. It has 12000mAh capacity. It's not as light weight as my other ones but this one sure has some power.I like the style of this one. It has Faux Leather textured outside casing. I got black but you have 4 great colors to choose from. It's durable, sturdy and another great thing about this battery charger is it's scratch-resistant. It also has 5 LED light for charging status indication.mAh (Milli amps Hour) is important because it's the easiest way to distinguish the strength or capacity of a battery. The higher the mAh, the longer the battery will last. Batteries with different mAh ratings are interchangeable. If your battery is rechargeable then the mAh rating is how long the battery will last per charge. Here's an example that best describes what mAh is.Think of a cars gas tank.  Voltage is how much gas is being used, and mAh is the size of the gas tank.  The bigger the gas tank (mAh) rating the longer the device will run. If your battery is rechargeable, then think of the gas tank as refillable (rechargeable).It seems that the smaller and light weight power banks the less mAh and the heavier the more mAh it is. At least that seems to be so with the ones that I have or have seen. Anyway, over all it does the job for home or office and I have not had any issues with it so far and have not observed any flaws.â–ºi received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way of my opinion of this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXRW7AUA4UF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTX2OSG#wasThisHelpful","RDXRW7AUA4UF7","A3RH3HS2KBTJMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RH3HS2KBTJMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:43 Mins WOW! I'm very impressed with this pocket chainsaw. I had been putting off trying it out because I don't have a planted tree to try it out on, so I thought I would try it out on the old tree from last year and yes, for me it was tough, but I was able to saw through it with ease. I did get out of breathe but that's because I'm not strong. I'm sure if someone much stronger were to try it , they would get through it in way less time.I only had a little challenge at the end. It would skip on me, but I'm sure it's because it was not planted in the ground so there was nothing to leverage it.I felt it was pretty easy to work. It cut pretty fast. But like I mentioned, I'm sure my husband would have cut through it in half the time as me.This would make a great survival tool.

It's a cute wallet to take with you when you are on a short trip to the store, or shopping when you only want to take your major credit cards and idOr on a nice outing in the evening.My only concern is that the braided part might tear being that i'ts not real leather, but that of PU leather. What is PU leather?PU leather, sometimes described as split leather is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term ""PU leather"") that is applied to the surface and then embossed.

PU material is far less durable, considerably cheaper in cost, and may not last long if used often.So with that said, that would be my only concern for now.I think that the price is about right, I think it will last for a while as long as you take proper care of it and maybe just use when time is appropriate.â–º I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

" 1:21 Mins What an adorable brush. It's perfect for my Grand Daughter. She is eight years old and is totally into brushing her hair and wanting it to look good. The bristles are flexible, yet durable. And the mirror on the back, is perfect.Brushing with synthetic bristles causes friction on hair, leading to cuticle damage and breakage, which makes hair lusterless and frizzy. Nobody wants that. So, this anti-static detangling brush is perfect. Did you know that proper hair brushing and scalp massaging are ""two"" of the most important elements in the maintenance and rejuvenation of healthy, naturally beautiful hair? True story.I remember when I was a child, my mother would tell me to brush my hair 100 strokes in the morning and at night. I absolutely ""hated"" it. But, I tell you what. My hair was so soft and shiny. But it also hurt my scalp. Why? because we had the old style brushes with those hard bristles. So happy times have change and technology has brought us these types of brushes.The brush seems to be very well made. I used it on my hair and there didn't seem to be any static when using it. And it sure feels good on my scalp that's for sure. It's like a mini massager. These types of brushes are great for those with super thick. With it's thick separated soft bristles, you won't get the pain if using a regular old thin bristled brush.It has 7 rainbow colors, S-Curl Wave Design. Make it fun too. Kids will love this brush.

" 5:12 Mins WOW! This diffuser is absolutely amazing. It's even better than the last one I got. My husband even likes this one. He is using it as a humidifier at night. He puts it next to him on his night stand. It's very quiet. The on button light is not bright at all, which is big plus because I like full darkness when I go to sleep.This diffuser puts out a lot of mist to help us sleep at night. I have noticed that over the past 4 nights that we have been using this diffuser/humidifier, we both have been sleeping much better. I didn't think it was going to happen but it did and I must say, I'm amazed.It's very well worth the money if you are using it for a humidifier. Now also take in consideration of your room size too. I would work in a bedroom, but if you using it say in a living room, it might not.Now on another note, this is a great diffuser as well. Because it has a larger hole at the top, more mist comes out and your room will be filled with your favorite aroma of your essential oil choice.I do recommend using 100% pure essential oils. Only put in a few drops and clean it between each use. Cleaning between each use, helps keep the oils from clogging up the hole, which could lead it to stop working.So, read your instructions and follow them.It's stylish and has a cool design.Just set the timer and the diffuser will shut down automatically after the chosen time is over and when water runs out, which can be a long time. The longest setting is 6hrs and that is really long.Features:'Color changing LED: It has 7 colors changing LED night light can be turned on to your preferred color or turned off completely or fade gradually'Wide hole at top for more mist and more aroma'Stays on for long hours because of it's extra large reservoirOverall, it's a really nice product, priced well and I believe this product will last a long time as long as it's taken care of properly.'

" 3:58 Mins These are actually pretty nice. They have 5 interchangeable lens. Which is great for the different times of day sun up to sun down.Even though they are sports style to use for cycling, running, I found them great just for taking a walk. I usually go for a walk every morning. My eyes are very sensitive and trying to find a good pair of sunglasses that I can see and not be too dark but also keep the sun out, is very hard for me, especially at a reasonable price.These sport sunglasses fixed that problem. I can wear these and not have to worry about sunrays. They keep just enough sun out and lets just enough sun in. I like that I can change them if it's cloudy day or a sunny day.You get a really nice hard shell case to take with you on travel, to store them safely away. Leave the case at home and just bring the little bag it has and put them in your back pack or cycle bag.They are unisex so they fit comfortable for both male and female. You have the adjustable nose piece to aid in fitting them comfortably on your nose.Pros:they look cool on.light weightShatterproof Flexible Polycarbonate Frame5 different color lensCons:you only get 1 polarized lenswhen I first tried changing the lens, I found it very difficult. Takes a little wearing in to get them changed out easilyOverall, I feel they are a nice product, price point if good, make of quality material and I believe they will last a long time if taken care of properly.

What is PU leather?PU leather, sometimes described as split leather is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term ""PU leather"") that is applied to the surface and then embossed. PU leather represents the look and feel of genuine leather but it's not. PU material is far less durable, considerably cheaper in cost, and may not last long if used often.So with that said, that would be my only concern for now.I think that the price is about right, I think it will last for a while as long as you take proper care of it and maybe just use when time is appropriate.â–º I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

"I can't even tell you how much I just love this microfiber towel. It's sooooo soft. It's perfect size to use as a hair towel, but It's also perfect for our car.

Not sure how well it will be with longer hair. When using on your hair, you really just need to leave it on your head for about 10-30 minutes, depending on the length and thickness of your hair and whether or not you want to fully dry it or just absorb the water in your hair. This towel is really absorbent.Microfiber towels absorb water a lot faster than regular towels in my opinion.It's 23"" x 4"" It's made very well.

"*2.5 stars*When the nicest thing you can think of about a story is, ""Well, it wasn't that bad"" then I think you have a problem.I'm not going to lie, the first two chapters were ROUGH. There is an alternating POV, which I normally love, but the first two chapters were near mirrors of each other, just from different perspectives. There was almost no new information, and I was preparing for a VERY bumpy ride. Fortunately, it improved a bit from there, but not all the way to ""like"" for me.Mason, for some reason, is obsessed with his lack of money and keeping up appearances. He insists on pretending that he is well off, and he hides the fact that he has to work for enough money to get the tutoring that he needs. This all made no sense to me because I went to a pretty elite college and most people there were saving their pennies for beer money and working during the summers or on weekends. The whole ""rich kids are the cool kids"" was too ""Pretty In Pink"" for my taste.Carter has a bizarre relationship with his parents. His dad wants him to follow in the family business and doesn't want to face facts that his son is gay, and Carter wants to be a photographer. His mom appears timid and a little afraid of her husband. I didn't get the characterizations of Carter's parents (and their weird 180 in their personalities near the end), and I didn't fully get the chemistry between Carter and Mason. It seemed a bit forced for my taste.While this book was a quick read, and honestly pretty pleasant overall, it had lots of cringe-worthy issues for me.

"*3.5 stars*A.M. Arthur loves angst. She loves it so much that she usually doesn't know where to stop, and her characters end up getting murdered while escaping drug addicted mothers WHILE overcoming dyslexia, or something to that effect. There is good angst and there is bad angst, and this author always just steps over the line for me. This book was less angsty (but think about the scale here!), which I really appreciated.I really enjoyed the slow way that the relationship between Boxer and Riley developed. Riley is hesitant to trust and very skittish, having lots of baggage in his past. Boxer is VERY patient, very giving, and extremely kind. He is a gentle giant, and he uses his calm nature to win Riley's trust and bring out his kinky side.A warning for all readers, there is a near non-con scene here so if that is a trigger for you, be forewarned. Other than that, I really enjoyed seeing Riley come into his own and discover his toppy side. I think the sex could have been a bit hotter and a bit more confident, if I'm being honest, but it was still pretty decent.Communication-wise, these guys were very good. However, my main issue is that I just didn't feel that special umph of a 4 or 5 star book. These guys were nice together, but not something I'll think on later.I can't wait to read Elliot's story, though.

"A little historical, a little paranormal, a little fantasy, a little cowboy, a little kinky... and a whole lot of AWESOME!! Holy shiznit, I loved this. When Marie Sexton and I get our mind-meld thing going, she can do no wrong.This is another book that I started in the bath, and I didn't want to ever get out. I read until I was all pruney... I got ultra-pruney for you, Marie Sexton!Song of Oestend takes place in a fictional historical western town. It is pretty similar to our wild west, with a culture like our Native Americans, but with a paranormal twist: wraiths rise up and kill those who are unprotected at night.This story was very beautiful. A very slow burn romance with some expected and some unexpected twists. First of all, I didn't see the type of BDSM coming... and I loved it. I have a huge weakness for the bigger guy being the bottom, especially if they have a place in their kinky hearts for being bossed around, ESPECIALLY if they are butt virgins! I mean, could it get any more perfect???The romance between Deacon and Aren was truly lovely. Tender, meaningful, interesting... just everything. The plot also worked. The ranch scenes were very atmospheric, and I got into it right away.Don't be scared by the mention of a menage scene. I'm not a big fan of menages but I was okay with the small play scene here. It was pretty hot, if I'm being honest.Gah, this was just SO well done and right up my alley!

"I hate to upset fans of Me Before You (hell, I'm a huge fan of Me Before You), but this was a very underwhelming sequel. I think if you are expecting the emotional punch of the first book you are going to be sorely disappointed.I'm not ashamed to say that Me Before You had me up reading until very late at night and then crying my eyes out until very early the next morning. It was the kind of book that sticks with you, the kind of book that is extremely hard to follow up. It ended on a very powerful note, so any book that calls itself a ""sequel"" has to match that kind of power. This didn't, not even close.We follow Lou's life a year and a half after the death of Will, and we see what her life has become. Honestly, I didn't enjoy this Lou very much. Gone is any spark, any vitality, any humor, and without those aspects of her personality I had trouble staying engaged with her. I didn't like this pushover Lou, and I barely recognized her from the previous book.Her life is wholly depressing. Lou is stuck completely in this sort of limbo, and reading about her mostly boring day to day things felt one note and tedious. Lou's family details, like her mother's newfound feminism and her sister's meddling, seemed contrived and almost silly. I didn't get what those side plots added to the story, and I didn't find them compelling.Lou's love interest was just... there. He was sexy in a classic romance way- the patient, motorcycle-riding savior- but I simply didn't feel the chemistry between him and Lou. It felt like a relationship without weight, certainly without the intensity of Lou's relationship with Will. If you are going to present a love interest to follow the one from Me Before You, it would have to be absolutely epic... this wasn't.And don't get me started on Lily. No spoilers from me, but Lily just irritated me to no end. She was SO selfish, and I struggled to feel much sympathy for her rich girl plight. I know the author tried to give us reasons to empathize with Lily, especially near the end with her convoluted backstory, but I was rooting for Lou to branch out and have more of the story-line to herself.However, this book's greatest crime, IMO, was that it was boring. I kept putting this book down and starting other stories, only to force myself back to this one after a few hours. And though this book has brief moments of greatness, and it wasn't bad or offensive in any way, it also failed to grab me the way I was expecting it to. After the way Me Before You gripped me, I think this was the biggest let down of all.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R220HHFARV5KA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101980397#wasThisHelpful","R220HHFARV5KA6","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*4.5 stars*Woah, Vanessa North, pain sluts are SO not my kink, but you made pain sexy and you OWNED this book!I solemnly swear that Vanessa North is the ONLY author that can make me like first person, present tense. When other authors fail and make this format painful to read, this author thrives. She has skills, ladies and gentlemen. I am a HUGE fan of this author and Rough Road just confirmed why that is, yet again.I was interested in Kinky Eddie from Double Up and I LOVED him in this story. Eddie is amazing. Rich, flamboyant, loyal, and knows what he wants, I fell in love with every swishy ounce of him. While his pain kink made me a wee bit uncomfortable at times (some of the scenes made me want to run for an ice pack!), I recognize that it turned the MCs on, so, in turn, it turned me on. Despite the kink thing, I just loved being inside his head, and I loved his interactions with Wish.Wish. I adored him, too. First of all, I LOVE me an age gap, and I really liked how Wish didn't care one iota about the pretty sizable difference in age between him and Eddie. He was sexy, self-confident, and kinky as hell.The tension in the story was pretty much the perfect amount. Everything felt effortless and flowed naturally. Sure, I could have used a bit more length (heh), but overall, this author didn't make a misstep. While this isn't a gushy romance, it was romantic enough for me for sure, and I think it reflected accurately on the characters.For all fans of this author, get excited for this one.

"Everyone has their favorite kinks. As some of you may know (those that pay attention to the nonsense I blurt out of my face), I am drawn to some specific kinks in the BDSM realm, namely domestic discipline, daddy kink, chastity, and humiliation kink. I actually cringe reading about flogging or whipping, and tying someone up does nothing for me. I get why some people love certain things, but a lot of those things are not for me and I don't love reading about them.If you analyze it further, all of my kinks are in the power control category. I just like it when someone has control over else that has nothing to do with pain or restraints. With domestic disciple, the idea that someone else is in charge and is keeping you in line feels just so... freeing, in a way. Now, in real life I don't think I could handle that, but I TOTALLY get the desire and it is very easy for me to get into a DD character's headspace.I found both main characters to be really, really interesting. The beginning was a little hard to read. Anyone could recognize the signs of an abusive relationship between Scott and Aiden, but I liked how the author made it a slow progression, like a real abusive relationship, so that we saw why Aiden was sucked in. I wanted to save him soooo badly, but it set the stage nicely for Aiden and Keaton's relationship. Keaton was a great guy. He was patient, loving, and gentle, and he took his role as a partner and DD top very seriously. I liked how he let things sort of evolve between him and Aiden and didn't push him too quickly.I did have some minor complaints. For one, Aiden was almost unbearably bratty at times, and I thought that he acted too immature at certain parts of the story. Also, I didn't get the weird personality shifts in Scott. I didn't find him acceptable in any way, and I wasn't sure if the author was trying to set up a future book with him as the MC so she decided redeem him a bit. It was odd.Overall, this book is a very quick, lovely read about the journey to a DD relationship. All DD fans should try this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y0LV131YH2P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VXAZKA#wasThisHelpful","R2Y0LV131YH2P7","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*3.5 stars*Woah... I mean, where to begin? Do you like angst? I mean ANGST? I'm not talking about baby angst, I'm talking about serious, advanced-level angst. Like addiction, mental illness, abuse, rape, neglect, priesthood... the whole angst package.I'm a huge, HUGE fan of Mel Bossa. Mel Bossa can write her ass off, and is, to be frank, above and beyond the skills of most writers out there right now. This story is... just insane, and she makes it so compelling that you won't be able to put it down for a second, I promise you that.For all of it's brilliance in writing and amazing, crystal-clear characters, it is also probably medically wrong, or at least it felt that way to me. The whole mental illness thing, which was barely touched upon in the blurb, is a HUGE factor in the book. I felt iffy about its treatment, and I'm not sure how I felt about the whole religion thing as well.I also still can't tell if this book is pro or anti-religion? Maybe both? Either way, religion plays a strong roll in this book, so if that is a turn off for you, be aware.The part of the story, however, that bumped my rating down is that I found Ryde and Alister's relationship to be so obsessive and insane that it was almost scary. To be fair, the characters know that their relationship is not normal, but it was hard to relate to such a desperate, strange, crazy dynamic. I'm not sure what these two had for each other, but I'm sure it isn't healthy.Again, this book is extremely hard to rate because it was so beautiful in it's gritty, screwed-up-ness that part of me wants to 5 star it, but another part of me was saying, ""NOOOOOO"" for a large portion of the story. I think if you are a Mel Bossa fan, like me, you have to at least try this one.

"*4.5 stars*Lesson learned: never doubt K.J. Charles.There is no getting around the fact that the start of this book is sort of slow. At first, I was feeling a little iffy about the story and having a really hard time connecting to the characters, which was freaking me out because this author is usually SO on point... like ALL of the time.Then things started to get interesting.The plot of the book is deceptively simple. A poor man comes into a fortune and needs to be tutored in the ways of London high society. However, the author makes this story so utterly compelling and way more nuanced than you'd expect.The character development really makes this story come alive. The MCs are such divided, flawed characters and I adored every bit of them. But as much as I loved Henry's rags-to-riches story, it was Julius who stole my heart. Julius was so contained, so in charge, that I just DIED with joy when Henry broke through that exterior, bit by naughty bit.This series has so much potential. I liked how the side characters were included (and how their own individual stories were teased) but didn't take away from the main couple's story. K.J.

"*4.5 stars*The 4th book in the Lost and Founds series takes place in 2002 at Burning Man. Now, I was only vaguely familiar with Burning Man before this book (I watched a very sandy flash mob marriage proposal there on youtube and that was the extent of it), but with a little help from Wikipedia, I got the gist. Burning Man is SO the logical place for Vin to be. It is eccentric and full of life and energy, so I wasn't surprised at all that he gravitated there. Through a set of unusual and fortuitous circumstances (duh, it's a Lost and Founds book), Vin meets a man named Alistar, who recognizes Vin and insists that Vin king him.I think I start off every book in the series the same way. I always sort of loath the main character, the guy getting Kinged, for the first half of the book. The Lost Kings always seem so selfish, so indifferent to my man, Vin Vanbly, and his obvious sacrifices. I'm always indignant on his behalf, and with King John, it was no different. Alistar is eager, way too eager, and too big, too inquisitive, just too. I had trouble loving him, and I was impressed when Vin found a way to love him.For about 40% of the book I was feeling a bit checked out. The writing was amazing, but I was getting frustrated with the back and forth between Vin and Alistar. Then, things took a turn for the worst. Something HAPPENS. Something big. After that point, when the action started really going, I could NOT put this book down.Many things happened that really made me love this book. I learned to love Alistar, like really love him, which I doubted I could do at the start. We also learn so much about Vin, more than ever before, though everything we learn about him is heartbreaking. We see Vin's humor, his resilience, his self-loathing, his generosity, and his spirit. There are some magical elements in this one, to be sure, but I liked them a great deal more than in The Butterfly King.That ending though... be prepared for a major cliffy. You'll finish this book not sure if you want to strangle Edmond Manning for leaving you in the lurch or love him for dreaming up such an emotional, well conceived story.**Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6EV0TIO1621/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OI7MZY#wasThisHelpful","R1E6EV0TIO1621","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ava March, my sweet, sweet Ava March. You are usually so spot on! Perhaps my own personal feelings came into play here but I wanted to SLAP Gabriel for most of the story!I'm the kind of girl who doesn't forget easily. You screw me over and I'm going to glare at you for the next bazillion times that we see each other. Now, I'm too much of a wimp to actually say or do anything, but you can bet I'm telling you off inside my head. Harshly.When Gabriel broke Anthony's heart as a teenager, I was ready to see some serious groveling the next time they met face to face. I was almost gleeful waiting for it. It never came. When Anthony sort of sucked it up and was friendly to Gabriel, giving him another chance so easily, I was like WHAAAAA?? I would have been one cold lady in those same shoes.Gradually my ire wore off. Gradually. But I still didn't like how Gabriel played hot and cold with Anthony, and I have no idea why Anthony put up with his crap.In terms of their secrets, I thought that Anthony's was a pretty clever plot element, but I was irritated by Gabriel's excuses and borderline abusive behavior.As usual, Ava March's writing was extremely readable and her sex scenes were hot (though less kinky than usual). I liked this story, in many ways, simply because Ava March wrote it and she is such a queen of historicals. But in terms of this series, this one was fairly lackluster.**Copy provided in exchange for an honest review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30UNCSJPZTBRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQVDZ98#wasThisHelpful","R30UNCSJPZTBRX","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So beautiful that it will make you cry. This is Kim Fielding's best work, I'm telling you.I'm going to tell you folks a story about patience.Once, I started a book by one of my favorite authors. It was a little slow going at first, and I wasn't sure if I was going to connect to the main characters. I was pretty sure that it was going to be a middling read for me, despite the gorgeous prose. But I stuck with it and, little by little, it just grew on me.At about 30% in I was feeling pretty good about it. By 50% in, I had a serious crush on the story. At 75%, it was love. By 100% I was crying because I didn't want to let it go.This is absolutely not a razzle-dazzle story. It isn't in your face in any way. The sex is hot and sweet, but you wouldn't read it for that alone, and there is almost zero drama in the story. It is simply a character study of two men in a small town who have lived and lost and how they come to fit in each others lives.I'm not kidding when I say it isn't action-packed. These guys spend most of their time tending bar, fixing things around the inn where the story takes place, doing mundane chores, really. But you know what? You will love reading about the mundane stuff because, at the same time, the real stuff is happening beneath the surface.Jimmy... just such a complex, perfectly imagined character. He starts off the book coming across as a aloof drifter, but then he becomes so much more. We find out what shaped him, and I simply loved having only his POV. Sometimes single POV books can be tricky, but it worked here.Shane, he just stole my heart. Disabled from an accident, he is still unflaggingly brave, loyal, interesting... I can't stop thinking of positive descriptors. I loved his sense of community and family and how willing he was to open his heart to Jimmy.If you are a Kim Fielding fan or a fan of well-crafted, slow burn stories, you must pick this one up. I can't stop thinking about the characters and you won't be able to either.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIL1XU6YM0U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JT4QV6#wasThisHelpful","RWIL1XU6YM0U4","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Retellings are so hard to get right, but when you combine a retelling from a borderline unlikeable character and you don't add anything new to the table, things go downhill VERY quickly.Just in case anyone was wondering, this CANNOT be read as a standalone. It is completely dependent on Every Day for context and plot. In fact, if you are expecting any sort of story structure, look elsewhere.""Another Day"" jumps around from notable event to notable event from ""Every Day"", just from Rhiannon's perspective. And let me tell you, I almost wish I'd never gotten a glimpse at her POV. First of all, her relationship with Justin was painful to read. PAINFUL. It is so clearly an emotionally abusive relationship that I wanted to shake Rhiannon. Justin is an epic douche, and I simply wanted to punch him in the nads the entire time.But what was most difficult to read were the details about Rhiannon herself. She is just less... special than she seemed in the first. More shallow, more insecure, less unique. It was disappointing, if I'm being honest.Despite knowing some more unsavory things about Rhiannon from this book, I would still have said that this story had merit except for the fact that this retelling brings very little extra to the table. The purpose of a companion piece is to shed new light and bring new information to the original book. Instead, I think this book and this author tried to milk an already successful book for more than it could give (ahem, ""Grey"").**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSJBTRGKO3ELL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385756208#wasThisHelpful","RSJBTRGKO3ELL","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series of Heidi's is a tricky one for me. I really want to love each book, but I always have some stumbling blocks that make me pull back on my ratings.I was pretty much dying for this book before it came out. I mean, BAZ AND ELIJAH!! So much angst, so much sexual tension, so much POTENTIAL! My rich, dreamy, cool guy gets it on with my angst-ball kinky sex snark-monster... le sigh. But while parts of this book were pretty awesome, I also didn't enjoy other parts of it.I'll start with some good stuff. Baz and Elijah don't skimp on the personality or the emotions. I mean, the FEELZ in this one... just off the charts. I really got a sense of Elijah's feeling of loneliness (hence the title, duh), guilt, and anguish from all that he's been through. I liked the fact that he was skittish and afraid, especially around Baz. Baz was also great as the reformed player struggling to find his place and path, and also trying to come back from some pretty serious physical and psychological injuries. Really interesting, well thought-out stuff here.So what's my beef? Well, for one thing, I found this book to be overly long and somewhat preachy-feeling. The preachiness is something that I've come to expect with this series. A lot of heavy-handedness with the messages of openmindedness, which is a great message, to be sure (!), but it gets a little after-school-special after a while. As far as pacing, the story really dragged towards the end for me, and I struggled a bit to pick it up again. This book took me DAYS to read, which isn't ever a great sign.Also, there were too many side characters for my liking. I like a lot of focus on my MCs and this book felt spread too thin. The side characters get a ton of playtime, and while I like visiting with characters from previous books of Heidi's, I really want to get to know the two MCs more and I sort of want to ditch the distractions.While this book was good, and I'm sure it will please most Heidi fans, it wasn't the Elijah-Baz explosion of awesome that I was looking for.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US9Q62G8SSXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3M5ZRS#wasThisHelpful","R1US9Q62G8SSXX","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your favorite Market Garden books were the ones featuring Nick and Spencer, than this book is for you.Do you remember Red Tie guy from Nick's book? He is back and needs a spanking in the latest HOT edition from the Market Garden series.In my opinion, this isn't as intense as Nick and Spencer's books and the chemistry isn't quite as strong. However, it is a surprisingly tender story about the evolution of a BDSM-themed relationship. I liked both MCs and the interplay between them. The mix of the real life driver/employee relationship with the bedroom dominant/submissive relationship made for an interesting dynamic. However, the strength of this book lay in the sex scenes. Like all of the books in this series, it delivered on the heat. Hello limo scenes! I love the way these authors write BDSM and they did a great job, once again, with this book.Though it made me a bit nostalgic for book 4 (my fave in the series), ""If It Drives"" was a very satisfying and successful read that set my Kindle on fire.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5Q91W6UXIVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JD1PLHE#wasThisHelpful","RB5Q91W6UXIVQ","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 very conflicted stars...Gahhh! What to say?! Parts of this story were REALLY good, just like the incredibly charming Knight of Ocean Avenue. However, parts of this book made me want to tear my hair out.Some people categorize this as a gay-for-you... it really isn't. Only someone deaf, dumb, and blind wouldn't have realized they were gay for 27 years when they secretly wacked off to yaoi and had trouble getting erections with women. Jim, come on, man.I liked Jim, overall. He was a very well-meaning, sexy, rough-edged guy who won me over throughout the course of the book, despite drunk driving...just NO, and faking a relationship with a woman who deserved better. I also liked Ken, the multi-talented doctor who feels pressure from his traditional mother to make a approved marriage. Their chemistry was... decent, though I've read much hotter, but I liked the contrast of them together. I also liked that they both had some history and mystery about them.What I didn't like was how Jim was so easily manipulated by everyone. He was like a puppet with other people pulling the strings for the majority of the book, and I HATED the fact that the two MCs didn't really get together until the very end of the story. Not nearly enough time, IMO, for them to develop ""love"" feelings; they just didn't spend enough one on one time together sober!!When I think about the particulars of this book, I get sort of angry. There are many of my pet peeves present in this story. But when I think about my overall feeling that I got while reading this book, I realize that I liked it, despite some of the choices that the author made. Apparently, I have a soft spot for this series.Looking forward to the next book where the two characters actually date EACH OTHER a little bit instead of other people.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYC4E4C4E4JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012JCCS92#wasThisHelpful","R1GYC4E4C4E4JS","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*2.5 stars*Charlie Cochet, why did you do this to me?! Ash and Cael's story was supposed to be epic!!I'm having a pity party over here, folks. I've been waiting on this story for the past few mediocre THIRDS books, and I was honestly expecting greatness. I've seen some glowing reviews, so I guess some people loved this one, but for me I think I'm being generous with my rating.What really bothered me was Ash's lackluster and totally wimpy excuses as to why he wouldn't or couldn't be with Cael. It was just... lame. I've heard some excuses in my day but this just took the cake. Gimme something real, something that makes sense, because you guys have been pining after each other for YEARS!Also, there is barely any sexual tension in this story. There are a lot of miscommunications and lots of missed opportunities, but sexual tension is just out the window. It was all so... boring.And was I the only one who thought that Ash treated Cael like a little kid, or a little girl? He always calls him ""blushing"" or ""sweet"" or ""cute"". Cael felt very neutered for me. I didn't get the fire and passion between them, and the relationship dynamics felt very M/F romance in a bad way.The plot... ugh. It is getting so muddled and confusing. Stop complicating the story, Charlie Cochet! This isn't Inception over here!I think I need to tap out of the THIRDS world. When my favorite character isn't even the main focus of the book (love you Dex, my boo), I think it's time to move on to greener pastures.

"Every once in a while I want to read something low drama. No pain, no angst, just two people meeting, romancing, and falling in love. This fit the bill perfectly.I want to state for the record that this story is NOT perfect. Some might call it slow (it is a pretty slow-burn romance) and it has a very abrupt cliffhanger ending, but I still found it utterly charming and totally smile-worthy.I sort of knew I was going to like this when I realized that James was as close to a virgin as you can get, despite fathering a child at 14. He was blushing, inexperienced, and really adorable. I liked the leisurely way that James and Gabriel got to know each other, and I liked the slooow corruption of James. *grins* I'm a dirty girl.Sometimes I'm not into meddling family members, but I really liked James's son, Dylan. He was supportive and just everything you'd want your son to be. I give Dylan the highest of fives!Easy to read, nice dialogue... I simply enjoyed this one.

"*3.5 stars*Remember that time I read the first five books in the Fever series in three days and dreamed about the characters for months? I certainly do. This series will always have a special place in my heart, and though I think that the series ended perfectly at the end of Shadowfever, I will never complain about more Mac, Barrons, or even more Dani.I also maintain that Karen Marie Moning is a genius. She created a world that worked so amazingly well and enraptured me so much that I feel like I own her a boot kissing. I'm so just grateful for the reading experiences that she gives me.When many readers hated Iced, I was one that stood firmly in the ""woohoo!"" camp. It wasn't perfect, for sure, but it was still pretty freakin' awesome.This book... a little less so.Yes, there were some amazing twists and turns, and yes, the writing was still very engaging, but I'm with other reviewers that said that they didn't like Mac as much in this book. She was certainly more... whiny? Bratty? Immature? Not overly so, but not exactly what I was expecting.It also felt very much like a middle book in a series because there are a LOT of cliffhangers at the end of this one, which was just maddening.

"I hate to crap on newish writers, but this just didn't work for me.This novella was a pretty political story about homophobia in the Republican party and a budding romance between a chief of staff and his intern. For the majority of the story, the MCs are not dating or really interacting, which I found to be a bit odd. I also wasn't really into the plot in general, though I thought the concept was cool.My first issue with the story is that the writing style was a little awkward. It felt a little too... planned? Ostentatious? Distant? Hard to describe, but I didn't connect at all with the author's voice.However, my real issue was with the characters. I found Brad to be sort of mean-spirited and self-involved, and I wasn't rooting for him at all in the end. I'm not sure what Sam saw in him, and I'm not sure really why they even got together (no sex content, BTW). They didn't have a lot in common, and their interactions were stilted and formal.There were also a lot of plot elements left unexplained or unexplored which I had an issue with.Not horrible but not the story for me.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K05NFQVDKXSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011A0STW4#wasThisHelpful","R3K05NFQVDKXSM","A1CDENNZT61W4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CDENNZT61W4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a big fan of Kursonâ€™s prior non fiction book Shadow Divers, and this is another excellent book about a similar topic. Pirate Hunters includes some of the same characters who populated Shadow Divers, but this time they are looking for an even more elusive quarry: a real pirate ship. I was not aware how few of these ships have ever been located. It makes sense after reading this story: pirates were secretive, and never advertised their location, their ships, or their cargo. After a space of a few years, a ship on the bottom of the ocean can be completely covered over, and never seen again. To find any remnant would be a major historical feat.Kurson gives a lot of background information on history, pirates, the Caribbean, diving, searching for sunken ships, and the men who do this. I enjoyed every page. He makes the material interesting, understandable, and entertaining. I was not particularly interested in pirates when I picked up this book, but before the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. Perhaps the author occasionally adds a little drama to his descriptions, but the story he tells is a true one, and the technical details are accurate. I could read anything this author writes, and be entertained as well as informed.I recommend this well written book to everyone, pirate lover or not. You will be sucked into the story, and come out on the other end with a lot of knowledge, some happy memories, and perhaps an ambition to do a little wreck diving yourself. At the very least, you will remember this as a very good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJ1B0VMEZJ1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400063361#wasThisHelpful","RLJ1B0VMEZJ1N","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a medium duty hammer tacker that handles 3/8 inch staples with ease. I used it to staple grade D building paper to wooden studs, and after a few swings I figured out just how much effort I had to put into the swing so that the staples would bury themselves. It weighs just under five pounds empty, and that is the proper weight for the job. The handle is well contoured and textured for my hand, which is small for a man. My wife has very small hands, and found this tool to be too large and heavy for her, but she doesnâ€™t share my love of toolsâ€¦I have arthritis in all my joints, and this tool did not bother me in any way. After tacking up the paper, I went over the staples with a hammer, to make sure they were all buried. It took very little time, since most of them were fine. It was an unnecessary step, but my OCD took over.The tool is well made, of quality materials, and feels solid in my hand. The staples load easily, and it did not jam once during my single day use.

"This is a highly readable novel about the aftermath of a terrible auto accident. The driver finds herself in a mysterious diner, peopled by dead celebrities, a kindly owner (Vinnie), and a mysterious, kindly man who turns out to be, well, I wonâ€™t give away the whole story. We learn the story behind her life, how she came to be in the accident, and how her life was full of misunderstanding and unnecessary suffering. In other words, she is just like every other human. She is full of plans for her future, but God has other plans for her.The story is well written. The characters are realistic, at least in their personalities, and the story moves along quickly. I read the entire story while on a long plane flight, and it made the flight seem very short. It is a Christian novel, and it is realistic without being didactic or preachy.Most of the action takes place in the diner while she lies in a coma. There are many flashbacks to her past, and her parentsâ€™ past, which help her understand how she got there, and help her to make the most important decision of her life. The story is full of Godâ€™s saving grace, hope and love. This is not great literature, or a sure-fire best seller, but that is irrelevant. This book brought me closer to God, and that was its great purpose.

"This is a highly unusual subject for a graphic novel. It consists of short scenes in the life of Iwan James, a GP in a small Welsh town. The doctor doubts himself, struggles with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), hates and resents his senior partner Dr. Smith, and obviously yearns for the attractive Dr. Lois. Dr. Smith mistreats and frequently puts him down, especially in front of Lois. Iwan fantasizes about telling Dr. Smith off, but never summons the courage to stand up for himself. He mostly gets along with his wife, although he feels unhappy in the marriage. He dreams of buying yet another bicycle (his wife tells him he doesnâ€™t need to have four bikes). The story is intensely personal, with flashbacks to his youth, the early days of his marriage, and above all his struggle with self-doubt, a common manifestation of OCD.The story is disjointed at times, with abrupt beginnings and endings. I had to check back sometimes when a character reappears after an absence of many pages. The artwork is ok, although details such as facial expressions are usually missing. As good literature does, this book reveals the inner life of a human being. Doctor Iwan is a pathetic creature at times, but who isnâ€™t?In one scene, while Iwan is laughing with Lois in their lounge, Dr. Smith enters and announces that â€œyou are way behind, Iwan, and losing us money.â€ That is his performance review for the day. When someone collapses on a bus nearby, Dr. Smith says he is too busy, and Iwan has to go, even though he is with a patient. Upon his return, he finds Dr. Smith reading the paper. Of course, Iwan had just left the nurse alone on the bus to patch up an uncooperative bleeding patient. His outrage is a bit tainted.This story is preoccupied with the psychology of the main character. The novel is more about obsessive compulsive disorder, and the daily struggles that OCD people face, than it is about a doctor.There are lots of patients in the book, ranging from tragic to annoying to menacing. You get to see what Iwan thinks about them. Some of the scenes make you cringe, some make you laugh, and some make you shake your head. Iwan is a real human being, and he exposes himself more than a doctor normally would. Most patients donâ€™t want to know all the stuff that might be going on in their doctorâ€™s heads. This book will show you what goes on in one doctorâ€™s mind. You may be sorry that you asked. Is Iwan a bad doctor? No, although he feels like a bad doctor. As a doctor once said, if you donâ€™t feel like a bad doctor sometimes, then you probably are one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ETIFTDH4R3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0271067543#wasThisHelpful","R37ETIFTDH4R3A","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I relied on this guide as my sole real world book when travelling in New Zealand. It is colorful, with beautiful pictures, large pages and enthusiastic writing by natives who live there. I read the book before leaving on my vacation, and I felt very excited to be in one of the most beautiful places on earth. The great outdoors did not disappoint: this is an incredibly beautiful country. Unfortunately, the book might have been written by the New Zealand board of tourism. It heaps praise on things extraordinary, and equally on things quite ordinary. My final conclusion was that this is not a guide to be trusted, and I left it behind in Queenstown.The writing is technically competent and well organized. There is background information, not in detail, but adequate for a travel guide. The writers enthuse about their happy New Zealand history, Maori history (glossing over the violence) and culture, and how New Zealand is a nation â€œwith a proud tradition of enlightened social policies.â€ My conversations with New Zealandâ€™s people leads to a very different conclusion. There was plenty of sorrow in their history, and there is plenty of trouble today. A tourist can ignore this, and simply enjoy the sights and adventures. But if you get into conversation with the locals, youâ€™ll discover that life here is not any more problem free than it is in San Francisco or New York.The book directed me to several attractions that did not deserve a stop, especially museums. I did enjoy a few museums, but concluded that New Zealand is a country with natural wonders, and a paucity of manmade attractions.Some of my most sublime moments in country came while visiting places I had discovered in other sources. A written book is at a disadvantage when compared to online sources: each page adds weight and cost. For that reason, I hope that a written guide would select special sights and places. It just didnâ€™t work out that way with this guide, on this trip.I do not mean to condemn this book, because it has a lot of good information. I simply found the information was questionable at times. On vacation I do not have unlimited time, and after a few obvious mistakes, I had to discard this volume. I did not read the whole book, or visit the whole country. When I return, I will carry a different guide.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16YIA6FC1G87Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178005176X#wasThisHelpful","R16YIA6FC1G87Y","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lonely Planetâ€™s latest take on Scotland is a good review of the highlights, plus some sidelights that you might otherwise miss, covering the entire country. It is generally well written, by locals, in clear, concise language. It comes with the usual Lonely Planet mix of eco-tourism, subdued lefty attitude, and good basic research that make these guides so beloved by some, so loathed by others. If you are of a certain age, you already know what to expect. If you are under 35, you probably wonâ€™t read this review, because anything current about travel will be online, naturally and inevitably. As a co-worker explained to me recently, â€œWho would carry a book when they travel?â€ Having just stormed the aisles of a discount airline, I see her point. These days, you need to travel light.Still, when my cell phone battery is low, and my service provider warns me that I have exceeded my international data allowance, I still like to have a real world reference, one that doesnâ€™t need a cell plan or a signal. Call me regressive, but I love the feeling of real paper, even the heft of it. This guide fits the bill.With chapters on all of the major cities and regions, plus details about those boring practicalities, you could rely on this guide as a single stop guide. It does give good suggestions on food, lodging, and entertainment, plus overviews of the cities, attractions, and culture. I didnâ€™t find any significant errors in this guide during my travels. It did alert me to some things that my online links failed to highlight.Although I still used my cell phone for finding restaurants near me, and online maps, I felt reassured by having this guide in my bag. There were times when I didnâ€™t have a cell phone signal, and times when I just didnâ€™t want one. If you can relate to that, you should probably take this guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4OP5QQ7QLTWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743215703#wasThisHelpful","R4OP5QQ7QLTWB","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oscillating tools are a bit mysterious. I didn't see a need for one, but once I got it, I began to use it  more and more. Now I donâ€™t remember how I did without it. Any cutting, sanding or grouting job that involves a small piece or a small place calls for the oscillator. Being a cheapskate and a skeptic, I bought mine at Harbor Freight. It works just fine.I didn't know at the time, but most of the expense with these tools is not in the purchase price. It is in the accessories. Imperial blades makes this metal and wood cutting blade, claiming that it can fit any oscillator out there. I canâ€™t verify that, but it is just fine on my Chicago Electric unit (Harbor Freightâ€™s brand). It fits snugly, cuts well, and hasn't worn out after a few Saturdays cutting wood with nails hidden inside. I am only a family handyman, not a pro. I use this episodically. For my purposes, this is a good blade. It doesn't stand out as any better than my previous blades, and I donâ€™t know if it will last a long time, but it easily cuts through metal and wood. Sixteen dollars seems like a lot for a single blade, but that is what the marketplace demands right now. Soon it will cost even more!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19VD7IK6KX0WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMAQ4K2#wasThisHelpful","R19VD7IK6KX0WE","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is well written, gripping, and fascinating. Sometimes it is sad or gruesome. It is accurate in the descriptions of medical details, surgical procedures, and the life of brain surgeons. If you like to think of your physician as a demi-god you should not read this book. If you can handle the truth, read on.As an anesthesiologist, I read with a mix of amusement and rueful resignation. Dr. Marsh is a true representative of his species, the neurosurgeon. They are by turns kind, irritating, cocky, courageous, arrogant, brilliant, obsessive, awe-inspiring, and lonely. They usually graduated at the top of their medical school class. Their residency did not end until they were well into their 30â€™s. Many hospitals have lots of pediatricians, intensivists, internists, and hospitalists, but they only have one neurosurgeon. Even in a field of doctors, a collection of brainy nerds, they stand alone.Their arrogance is undeniable. Henry Marsh relates how he was stuck in a line of shoppers at the grocery store and thinks with irritation that none of them could do what he just did today, so why does he have to wait behind them? Like fighter pilots or Special Forces, society is not comfortable with such people, but when we need them, we need them desperately. And we always need them.There is a moment before every invasive medical procedure when you could pause and contemplate the enormous consequences of failure. If you spend too much time doing that, you will end up paralyzed, and the patient will suffer. If you spend too much time thinking about the appalling human carnage that will result from surgery gone wrong, you will never take up the knife. No matter how skillful, knowledgeable, and careful you are, there will be carnage. No one knows this better than the neurosurgeon. To cut into a human brain takes enormous hubris. Every procedure includes the risk of death, but there are worse things than death. Most doctors will see worse-than-death only rarely during their career, but the neurosurgeon sees it often. It is the nature of their specialty. It is beyond extreme. For example, I induce a death-like coma in my patients daily, then rescue them from it. Yet I could not abide such a life of enormous risk.Dr. Marsh is a writer of depth and skill. He probably does everything well, if he does it at all. If you think that neurosurgery is fascinating, you should read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSJ6XOLXUEIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006581X#wasThisHelpful","RKSJ6XOLXUEIL","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lightweight, slim-bodied protector for the i-Phone 6. It fits around the sides of the phone, and covers the back, but there is no protection for the glass, which is the part most likely to break. I think that the otter is a more protective (and expensive) solution, if you are really worried about damage. This is much smaller and lighter than an otter. You have to balance protection against size and weight. The edges are easy to grip, and provide a more positive feel than the naked phone itself. I did not test it by dropping the phone onto a hard surface, because I didnâ€™t want to risk one of these infernally expensive things. The case seems to be made of a resilient material, which is flexible but strong. It snaps on and off the phone easily. There are holes for all of the buttons and controls, as well as the camera. It does not interfere with the function of the i-Phone.My sons thought that the gold on this case was too gaudy for their tastes. It does have a reflective quality to it. I didnâ€™t mind, but I am not a fashion guy. It looks exactly like the picture, so you get what you see.

"This is a well written, action packed novel that kept me reading compulsively until the end. It is full of suspense, and the main characters became people that I cared about, although they have major flaws. Although this is science fiction, there is a lot of real life detail about the importance of water in the western United States. I would have given this book five stars. But there are some problems.There is a lot of graphic violence, and graphic sex in this novel. The author has written books for young readers, but this is aimed at adults, and would not be appropriate for teens. The relationships between the main characters were not realistic, and required a long stretch of the readerâ€™s imagination. The author paints a bleak future for the United States, in line with the current beliefs of progressive environmentalists. His scenario of water scarcity is a real possibility, regardless of the debate over climate. The prospect of states going to war with each other, while still nominally part of the United States, presents another exercise for the imagination.I thought that the book was excellent in many details, but the problems make me reluctant to recommend this to many readers. If you are not put off by violence, and enjoy a wild tale, well told, this may be a great read for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PF3RPTZ2UY5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352875#wasThisHelpful","R3PF3RPTZ2UY5L","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This handy little speaker runs off of batteries, which can be recharged by USB or any AC outlet. It connects to your audio device via blue tooth or via an aux cable. As advertised, it allows you to enjoy external audio playback without draining your playback system's batteries.The setup was easy, intuitive and self explanatory, which was good, because the package insert was brief to the point of extinction. I charged the unit overnight, and the next morning had it playing in less than two minutes. The controls are on one end of the device, four simple buttons. Unfortunately the symbols that reveal the functions of these buttons are engraved into the buttons, black on black, which made them difficult to read, even with my glasses on. You can discover their function by pressing them, but this is a minor design flaw. The unit is very compact, lightweight, and portable.The sound is underwhelming, not as full or as voluminous as my simple PC speakers. You can't expect a concert hall for this price, but I expected more than I heard. Speakers are a highly variable personal product, and you should listen to them before buying, whenever you can. I would not buy this at the current price ($46.00), but might spring for them if they were under $30.

"I was afraid this book would be a poorly written diatribe about Christians in a hostile world. Instead I encountered a well written, well documented account by an accomplished and professional author. I admit that I should have been better acquainted with Mr. Shortt, the religion editor of the Times Literary Supplement, and author of a biography of Rowan Williams. He writes clearly, concisely, and skillfully.The introductory and concluding sections are the best part of the book. Shortt makes some revealing statements.  Christianity is not a ""western"" religion, and most Christians are not westerners. By sheer numbers, Christians are the most persecuted people in the world today. Most telling is the revelation that secularism is being soundly trounced by religion in the public sphere of our world. Residents of the US and Europe may assume that the secular and scientific viewpoint is ascendant today. That is not a valid assumption.The middle chapters each deal with one country, or one region. They are comprised of a brief history, followed by a catalogue of oppressions and atrocities against Christians. The reading of these chapters is difficult, depressing, and ultimately numbing. There is not a strict narrative structure to the bulk of the book. It is in large part a summary of events. This is not a casual or enjoyable read.Christianophobia works as documentation of the excesses of governments and ethnic groups against the people of that faith. It is not destined to become a best seller, but it is an important entry on a topic that will surprise many Americans. The major news media ignore this story. It doesn't fit their view of the world. Nevertheless, the story unfolds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZL90VCHCEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802869858#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZL90VCHCEA","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a lifelong user of electric shavers, and I have owned this shaver for over one year. I use it every morning to shave. I also use the trimmer to cut longer hair around my face. I have never used it in the shower, always shaving dry, with no shaving cream or oils.This is an effective shaver, although the cutting ability has declined moderately over time. It takes me longer to shave now than it did when new. I have had no other complaints with the quality of the device. The foil has been remarkably durable, more so than the remington micro foil shavers I had in the past. The cutting action is about the same as my prior remington shavers, and slightly better than norelco electric shavers. It cuts better on the flat surfaces of the face than it does on the curves.The battery allows me to shave four or five times before requiring a recharge. My main complaint with this unit is the battery recharge. Unlike some other electric shavers I have used, this unit does not function while recharging. If the battery dies, it requires at least 20 minutes to recharge enough to finish the shave. Since I can't wait that long on most work days, I have to finish my shave with a conventional razor.I would buy this unit again.

"Mr. Thomas knows the Irish, in a way that they only know themselves. He is one of the tribe, but being fatally afflicted with the writer's curse, he cannot keep the secrets. They are out there for all to see in this novel. He is a good writer, crafting characters who live and breathe, dialogue that rings true, and a family history that tells it as it was. Some have hailed this as a great American novel. It is premature to say or write those words, but it is a fine book, skillfully wrought, knowingly plotted, full of truths mostly told.It starts slowly, but gathered momentum by the fourth chapter, and  became a winner. If you come from an Irish family, you will read this with some pain of recognition, but you could do much worse than to read it. Anyone can read it, because it tells a universal story, one that should appeal to all readers.

"This novel took me by surprise, so accomplished was the writing, so skillful the plot, and so memorable the characters. Ms. Mandel is a writer of considerable style and acumen. The story revolves around an philandering actor named Arthur, who dies of a heart attack just before a devastating flu  kills over 99% of humans on earth, ending modern life, throwing us back about one thousand years. The plot bounces back and forth between the years before the event and a couple of decades after, tracing the development of several key characters, their lives intertwined in important and surprising ways.  There is a sustained level of tension, a suspense that kept me turning the pages. There is some violence in this story, and the flu is described in general terms, although not with graphic detail. Mandel depicts the discomfort and hardship faced by the survivors in vivid imagery. Some details of this story are farfetched. Nevertheless I was satisfied with the degree of realism, and I enjoyed the novel as if it were a true story.I felt a special affinity for several of the characters. The author makes them into real and complex individuals, even if they don't get a lot of time in the story. Other characters are frightening in their cruelty and cunning, which is also realistic. Although the story is sad in many ways, it is also has moments of great beauty. I agree with reviewer  J W Kennedy that this book is not especially ""fun"" to read, but I am glad to have read it anyway. Some of the best books are not fun, yet they leave a lasting impression, and stimulate your thinking for years after.

"Michael J Sullivan is a decent writer. He has some problems with plot transitions and occasionally lapses into awkward dialogue, but he is a good story teller. He creates two believable characters in this novel. Their story is affecting, engaging and occasionally delightful. They represent the high points of this novel.The other characters are mere props, including the main villain. The author missed a chance to make the villain a real human, someone with complex motives, understandable flaws, or just a characteristic that would allow the reader to have some sympathy for him. This is the heart of my disappointment with Hollow World, and with other Michael J Sullivan stories. The villains are people who hold a particular view of the world. The author disagrees with that view. So much does he disagree with them that he makes them mean, nasty, narrow-minded and murderous creatures. This is otherwise a good story, with some moments of exciting action, genuine emotion, and an uplifting message.The author wades into contemporary politics, making his villains into a caricature of right wing bible readers. It is difficult to strike a blow for tolerance by demonizing your fellow Americans, but Mr. Sullivan makes a gallant attempt. He assumes that his readers will agree with his prejudices. Like many political partisans, he believes that he is above the narrow minded opposition. Unfortunately for this novel, he is not.I enjoyed the adventure of this novel, the time travel element and the suspenseful action. The world which the author creates is a beautiful and fascinating one. I wished that he had explored it further. The story devolves into a struggle between two contemporary humans, with the future world as a backdrop for the action, the future humans as mere background. It is a conflict between a liberal and a conservative from present day Michigan., a peaceful, flawed but reasonably likeable liberal and a crafty, violent, destructive right winger.  The conservative misunderstands the bible, while quoting it in a, dare I say it, liberal fashion. This is not an entirely one-sided tale, as the author allows the protagonist to muse about the possibility of God. The main character dispatches more than one villain with a gun, so this is not a philippic on handgun violence. Still I was disappointed with the author's parochial world view, and his focus on contemporary politics. It marks the novel with the stain of prejudice, and denies the universality of the human struggle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJMC7E2ZTKIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161696183X#wasThisHelpful","RAJMC7E2ZTKIO","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fine and engrossing novel, based upon real historical events, fashioned into a human story by the skilled pen of Ms. Christie. The main character is not Gutenberg, because this story focuses on Peter Shoeffer, first a scribe, then an apprentice, and ultimately the world's first widely successful printer. He was instrumental in the making of the Gutenberg Bible, the world's first book published by means of a printing press. He founded the Frankfurt Book Fair, and published the Mainz Psalter. I especially enjoyed the wonderful description of that ancient book fair, which is still in existence today.This novel has a solid plot, realistic characters, and an engaging story. The first printing of the bible was a perilous undertaking, and very well might have failed utterly. The men who accomplished this herculean task had to work in secrecy, often under threat of arrest, imprisonment, and worse. There was never enough money, and the constant danger of bankruptcy.  Adding to this was the unstable nature of Gutenberg himself, and the constant bickering that went on within the small company. All of these elements lead to a memorable story, one that I read in a single long airplane flight. In spite of several flight delays, I was happy enough with this good book.The only complaint I would mention, and it is a minor one,  is that the constant fighting between two of the characters became tiresome. This may have been the way it really happened, but I was a bit tired of them by the last chapter. Nevertheless, this is a fine story, one which I recommend to bibliophiles and general readers alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPXBTYJS7M22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062336010#wasThisHelpful","RIPXBTYJS7M22","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this story. It had the mechanics of a good novel: an experienced, award winning writer, a good plot, a story of adventure and constant danger, and a claim of historical accuracy. Unfortunately, this novel is a wasted effort. The claim of accuracy does not survive the first chapter. The author creates a world of noble savages, the eco-heroes, with organic diets and lives of happy harmony.  Although they live in constant warfare with each other, under continual threat of starvation or torturous murder, they are depicted as happy, nearly flawless creatures. They greatly exceed the white men in strength, knowledge, wisdom, even in appearance. Their propensity for torturing the members of nearby tribes to death is described by the author as the way to pay a wonderful compliment to their enemies. The only wrong they can do is to become friends with white men.But oh the white man! It is fashionable to depict them as evil, to attribute the bad things in history to their misdeeds. Mr. Boyden excels at self hatred, and he has done a yeoman's job at that dubious task. He is so much the yeoman that he loses any semblance of verisimilitude. The white men in this novel are evil minded, small, scrawny, disease ridden (although it is the native population that is devastated by disease), incompetent in every way. Champlain's bodyguards hold muskets at the ready, but the author says that his Huron guests could easily kill them all, such great warriors are they. In fact, they laugh at the white men, because they are such ineffective, insignificant fools.Christophe, ostensibly the protagonist, is a Jesuit priest full of ignorance, prejudice and fumbling misunderstanding. The priest thinks that the epidemics sweeping through native American tribes are God's plan to eliminate ""the weak and the wicked."" He tries to win the Hurons over to Christianity by trickery and bombast, never quite realizing that they laugh at him. Why did the author need the priest to be a fool and a stinker, at best a crafty villain? Apparently Mr. Boyden is still angry about his expulsion from a Jesuit high school. The only positive aspect of Christophe's character is his ability to die well.As other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are caricatures. There is a lack of balance in this novel. There was no suspense in the later chapters, because there were no real human beings here to capture the reader's imagination. The author tries to pay tribute to first nation people by describing them as demigods, idealizing their culture and their character. He does them a disservice. This novel is so unbelievable that it is not even effective as propaganda. I was hoping for an historical novel that would immerse me in a distant time and place.

This, the second in a series, centers on the captain of a small but stealthy destroyer, his friend the brilliant medical officer, and the formerly demoralized crew of the ship.  They are engaged in a desperate struggle against a larger, better prepared alien foe. Humanity is losing the war, and extinction is a real possibility. This is no Star Trek with its idyllic view of the universe.The action is fast and intense, with the deadly Krag forces menacing them at every turn. The author builds a believable story, with friendship, rivalry, honor and treachery enough to keep the reader wanting more. The author also displays a good knowledge of history, culture, and naval tactics, expanding and adapting them to the three dimensions (and sometimes more) of space. The danger never lets up, making this a true page-turner.Honsinger writes extraordinarily well for a self published author. If you look at the distribution of the ratings for this book, you will see that his readers appreciate him. Although you can sometimes tell that the editing was thin in places, it is a totally readable and enjoyable novel. There are some abrupt transitions, and some places where the action bogs down in discussion, but I enjoyed this book immensely, and you will too.Some reviewers have noted that the story is told from a particular point of view. The tone is very gung-ho, and mostly uncritical of the military. This series is almost a celebration of the navy, albeit a future navy. There are no shades of grey, no HR reps telling the heroes that they shouldn't shoot at their enemies because we're all peaceful government workers now.  If you like moral relativism and ambiguity, look elsewhere. The title should have warned you off anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TAP9PKLP4S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477849483#wasThisHelpful","R6TAP9PKLP4S3","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Digital calipers are versatile and easy to use. I have a pair that I use frequently, switching between metric and imperial units on the fly. They don't last forever, as I found out. Dial calipers are easy to read, but they can get out of calibration, and they can break when dropped. I wanted a mechanical set of calipers, one that will work well 50 years from now, one that I can hand down to my children. These are excellent, highly accurate and absolutely foolproof. I do need glasses to read them, but other than that, they are very easy to use.

"Rebecca is a once famous photographer who faces a dwindling stream of income, now that her best work is many years behind her. To save money, she rents out her Manhattan apartment, and moves to an inexpensive place in the country.  Things do not go smoothly.Anna Quindlen has a practiced way of nailing her characters. Rebecca's ex husband  is  ""so European""  a short but pregnant phrase. These two words pin him down to the dissection plate, a man who refuses to help around the house, and refuses to stop screwing around with other women.Sometimes the main character contradicts herself. I am not sure that the author intended this. Rebecca hates to think that her bed is now occupied by ""the renter"" a man whom the reader should dislike, because we only learn negative things about him. He is described as a retired executive, the type of man who is used to having things done for him. I laughed when I read that line, because no one is more used to having things done for her than our protagonist. She is an artist though. Maybe that changes loathsome qualities into endearing ones.This is a small quibble. Quindlen has a winning way with her characters, revealing them gradually, by action and flashback, until they become old friends to the reader, people that you can love, people that you root for.  Still Life is a pleasant story, dealing with love, growing older, losing one's past and making new starts. Although I had my doubts at first, I enjoyed it greatly. It kept me up late one night, eyes drooping with fatigue, until I had read the last page. Even though I really needed the sleep, I was disappointed that the story was over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0ZELRJK2M79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400065755#wasThisHelpful","RI0ZELRJK2M79","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The building of the first two subway systems in the United States makes for an epic adventure in storytelling. Doug Most is certainly equal to the task. He presents the story as a rivalry between two cities and two brothers, with obstacles galore, and tragedies by the dozen. It is a story worth the telling, and I enjoyed it. This represents a detailed history of the time, as well as a valuable recording of grand events in the life of two cities, events which still resonate today.Mr. Most has done an enormous amount of original research in preparation for this work. As he mentions in an afterward, in a tribute to the public libraries in Boston and New York, it is amazing  how much history is contained in the papers held in these libraries. Much that is worth knowing is still missing from the pages of the internet, and perhaps perpetually will be out of the digital realm.If you are interested in the history of these two enormous transit systems, a history which reveals much more than the details of transportation, you should get a copy of this book. It is well written and well researched. You will be entertained and informed at the same time. There aren't many ways to do that!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPR4X82AGT80Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312591322#wasThisHelpful","RPR4X82AGT80Z","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an encyclopedic novelization of the relationship between Fanny VanderGraaft and Robert Louis Stevenson. The details and the historical elements are accurate.The characters are realistically portrayed, and the action moves along at a pleasant clip. I learned a great deal about the author and his love, their trials, and even some interesting details about the guilded age. I was greatly pleased to read and review this novel through the Amazon Vine program.My only criticism, and it is a small one, is that the story did not stir my emotions. I enjoyed the book, but it was easy enough to put down when other duties called. Even when a heart breaking event happened, I did not feel a large emotional impact. Ms. Horan is a fine writer, with excellent skills. I simply did not connect with the story in a way that was deeply felt. Hopefully other readers will.

"This is a fine adventure tale by a  writer who is lacks basic writing skills. The plot is wonderful, the imagined future world believable, and the main character is realistic. The writing is badly done. Description, dialogue, and word choice are lacking in many important ways. Although I liked the story, the clunky mechanics were impossible to ignore, and they detracted from my enjoyment in reading this novel.I had read The Maze Runner, which was also a good story, badly executed. I hoped that Dashner's writing would improve with experience,, but that has not happened. Eye of Minds has been compared to Ready Player One, and the story is similar in some ways, but the writing is not nearly as accomplished.I am reluctant to write a negative review, because Dashner has done something that I have not, and probably could not do: he is the successful author of several books. I wish him continued success. His fans do not object to his writing style, so I am left like a vox clamantis in deserto, but I cannot stop the vox clamantis in me. If you love writing, and you are a fan of great literature, you will probably not enjoy this book.  If you enjoyed The Maze Runner, you will probably love it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSQMJ6EB7FS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385741391#wasThisHelpful","R2WSQMJ6EB7FS3","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fictional history of a group of young New Yorkers who come of age during the 1980's. From a summer camp in upstate New York to Manhattan of the 1980's, we watch them grow up, some successfully, others with disappointment, and all with dissatisfaction. The cardinal sin of envy divides friends, but there are other divisions in these pages.The family at the center of this small universe, the Wolfs, is portrayed as attractive, glamorous, capable and slightly mysterious. Once they are revealed, we discover that they are riddled with pathos. The false fronts, the carefully crafted and nurtured lies, the wealth and mismanagement, all collide in a life of pain and anguish. Still, the characters believe that Wolfs are as they seemed, in spite of the evidence. Their portrayal is realistic enough that you can recognize them, but the author sympathizes too much. Each of the main characters is devoid of grace, humor and charity (except Ethan), and without a clue towards the meaning of life. They attach great meaning to their own lives, but for the wrong reasons. When Ash's mother dies, Jules consoles her with ""She wasn't supposed to die so young."" The narrator steps in: ""Or ever, was what Jules meant. Betsy Wolf at sixty-five had still been a beauty. She was a docent at the Met, and taught an art class there for children on Saturdays. Everyone always said how young and elegant she looked."" This is the author taking the measure of Betsy's life. The things that don't matter.The third person omniscient has some pitfalls, and this author falls into one of them: the narrator interjects her own opinions, interrupting the flow of the story, presenting her opinion as fact. The facts may be whatever the author decides, because this is her universe, but the technique disrupts the story in a way that veers from storytelling to preaching. The previously mentioned quote about Betsy Wolf is an example. Another occurs at the end of the book, when Ash's daughter criticizes her parenting. Wolitzer writes: ""That isn't true,"" said Ash, who'd been a tremendous motherâ€¦ If Ash had been a tremendous mother, that should be evident from the story. Writers don't need to tell us- they show us.The characters and the author espouse a view of life, politics, and money that personifies the bitter  divisions of contemporary America. They are ""nice"" people, not the type that transgress the boundaries of polite society. Nevertheless, they display a ready hatred of people who think differently than they do. Their harshest words, and espousals of violence, are directed at their political opposites. This could have been a character flaw that shaped the plot. Instead it is presented as a mundane fact, an acceptable attitude.  Due to her writing technique, I concluded that the author is of a similar mindset. Ms. Wolitzer says that she writes about things that matter. If she could overcome her narrow view of the world, her book would have a greater impact.Great writing embraces the universal in life. Regardless of your outlook, opinions, or character, you can find important truths in the pages of the great books. Meg Wolitzer is a talented writer, but this is far from a great book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300NPXDNE0NQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U4HH54#wasThisHelpful","R300NPXDNE0NQ5","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The American legal system is so complex that most Americans cannot comprehend it. Yet this lack of understanding does not excuse anyone from following the law, even laws that you have never heard of. The easiest way to navigate this minefield is to hire a lawyer, who will happily explain the complexities to you at $400 per hour. This is not surprising, because laws are made by legislators, who are mostly lawyers. Since you can't avoid the law in our increasingly scrutinized and regulated lives, most of us are caught in a bind: we need legal advice, but we can't afford it.Nolo press fills this need with their publications and their website, [...] Nolo books cover a multitude of legal subjects, including financial (How to file for bankruptcy), traffic law (Beat your ticket), and family (Essential Guide to Divorce).This handy little book covers a seldom discussed topic: how to take your money out of a retirement plan. Most people assume that this process is automatic. You retire, stop earning money, start taking money from your IRA or 401k, and live a care-free life. Unfortunately, taking your money out of a retirement account is even more complex than putting it in. If you take it out too fast or too soon, you lose a lot of it to taxes and fines. If you take it out too slowly, you might get a %50 fine. Even after you retire, the IRS will loom large in your life. The government watches retirees closely, to make sure that they can tax all of their retirement savings. Again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, even if you are getting on in years, and becoming a bit forgetful.The time to read this book is now, because decisions you make during your working years will have a huge impact upon your retirement. I wish I had read the chapter on Roth IRA's before I created one. If you have any sort of retirement plan, you should read this book.This is not a page-turner. I didn't stay up late reading this. But it is necessary reading, and it can save you thousands of dollars. It is a reference, so you shouldn't read the whole book, just the chapters that deal with your retirement. You may be very glad that you did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5R9U3BCQ29K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1413319025#wasThisHelpful","R3U5R9U3BCQ29K","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found that it was too short to include enough details about the places I visited, and left it in the hotel after the first day.  It is well organized and written, but the contents gives only a little more detail than the pamphlets and free information available. By far the best guide to Williamsburg are the people who work there, dressing in period costumes, and staying in character through most of the day.

"This is a great story. A callow, cowardly architect agrees to design a hiding place for jews in a Paris apartment during world war two. He has no love for them, but he is greedy beyond his own good sense. He thinks that he might get away with it, but (unbeknownst to him, his mistress is sleeping with an SS officer, and his assistant reports to the Gestapo.

The author has written non fiction books on these subjects, and his knowledge is imparted to the reader in a way that made me want to know more.Unfortunately, Mr. Belfoure is not a good writer. His sentence structure is disastrous, his descriptions clunky, his narration a constant intrusion into his own story.  The characters are mostly flat, one dimensional, and static.

"This is a sizeable collection of essays on scientific topics, stories about scientific inquiry, and personal reflections by a few scientists themselves. Journalists and writers are better represented in this collection than scientists, but these are writings about science, not scientific articles.The topics are varied, but all hew to scientific orthodoxy. You won't find any Galileos or Darwins in these pages, only science writers who stay close to the scientific mainstream. In a brief introduction, the series editor reveals his own limited views, and a tendency to lash out at those on the fringes. He cites Galileo as an example of a real scientist, and in the next paragraph uses the Pisan iconoclast as a club with which to beat the iconoclasts  of today, without a hint of irony. Such are the limitations of the orthodox. Mukherjee's introduction ""on tenderness"" is much more satisfying, and  more engaging.There is plenty of good writing here, and even some science worth reading about, interspersed with a few uninspired chapters. Benjamin Hale writes about the distinction between humans and other species. He reviews the fascinating and disturbing history of language experiments with chimpanzees, experiments that few have considered in detail. The devil is truly in these details. Hale proposes that language is the last dividing line between human and not human, a distinction which is faulty, because there is no true distinction between us and the higher mammals. His thesis is unconvincing.Tim Zimmerman from Outside magazine introduces us to the observation of dolphins in the Caribbean, and the prospects for communication between species. The articles on quantum mechanics and the digital nature of the universe are amazing, and  difficult, because they describe mathematical phenomenon in written language. You cannot read more than a few chapters before you confront the magnitude of the changes that are happening in our natural world, especially the widespread extinction of ocean life.There is a bizarre entry by Oliver Sachs, recounting his midlife drug abuse. Neurologists are a strange bunch, but this story is of surpassing strangeness. The other physician in this volume writes a fascinating summary of the exciting possibilities of immunotherapy in ""The T-cell Army."" Mark Bowden of Blackhawk Down fame introduces us to an extremely inquisitive man who is quantifying his body, and the final chapter reveals the wisdom of psychopaths, and although psychologists don't use that term anymore, it is a good article.I always preferred science to any other subject when I was a young student, so it was predictable that I would like this book. I recommend it to all those who love science, and all those who don't.

"This is an interesting, mostly accurate, but uncritical account of JFK's cabinet. Robert Dallek is a professional, polished and engaging writer, one who has written many books on US presidents. He writes mostly about democrats, and mostly with a measure of deference. He mentions scandals and shortcomings in relation to the 35th presidency, but dwells mostly on the high points. It is a readable but incomplete portrait of the cabinet.We hear about Joe Kennedy briefly, about his rapid rise from the son of an Irish immigrant to the heights of power in the Roosevelt administration. We don't hear about his rum running, or how he turned on his former business associates, jailing them for the very misdeeds that he understood so well, indeed, the very ones that he employed in building his fortune. He mentions Kennedy's Pulitzer in 1957 for Profiles in Courage, leaving out the bit about how Kennedy didn't actually write most of the book, and that Joe Kennedy bought or leaned on the Pulitzer committee, who dutifully delivered the prize. This is strangely similar to another president who won another prize.The subject of this history,the members of the cabinet, garner much praise, some of it deserved, but their faults and shortcomings are downplayed. After finishing Camelot's Court, I was left with the impression that this was a brilliant group, perhaps rarely equaled in American politics. Their lack of achievement can be partly blamed on the untimely death of the president, but only partly.There is still an adoring audience for this tragic president, and many journalists, writers and pundits remain firmly in this camp. Unfortunately, hagiography is not history.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T6JJK2OCDJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006206584X#wasThisHelpful","R25T6JJK2OCDJG","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a translation of an Italian language novel, set during the breakdown of modern society and a descent into lawlessness. It is the story of a passive coward, a writer and English professor, who wakes up to life when it all falls apart. The writing is skillful, clear and beautiful, the characters realistic and well formed, but the writer creates an action tale that is unemotional and dry, the climactic scenes devoid of emotion. The protagonist finds some inner strength, but he remains mainly passive and non violent, except to himself. Terrible things happen as a consequence.The story captured my interest, never quite becoming a page-turner, but engaging my attention and my imagination. The main character was willfully stupid and passive through the first half of the story, then a helpless prisoner for most of the second half. The author allows us to witness much of the brutality and horror that are rampant in this apocalyptic world, but the description of events remained unemotional, even with graphic depictions of sex and violence.The story veers away from realism near the end, when a key event changes everything. I lost some respect for the writer as a result.

"This is a well written history of George Washington at war. Many biographies of our first president have been written, but none have taken this view of the man, a warrior, sometimes reckless, sometimes wrong, but always a man who saw himself in military terms. I enjoyed reading this book, although it was not always a page-turner. It tends to bog down in the administrative details of military life, since those administrative details are the remainders that historians work with. I love history, especially early American history, so this was a natural fit for me. If history bores you, pass this by.There were many details of Washington's life in this book, as well as the momentous events of his time. His troubled and troublesome foray into battle at Fort Necessity, an event which started a world war, is the subject of chapter two. It was an inauspicious start to a military career, but, fortunately for the United States, he learned from his mistakes.The author does not often delve into opinion, mostly sticking to the facts. He presents his own view of Washington at war, but it is a view presented with historical details. I discovered that the straightforward presentation was more convincing than any essay.

"This is a winner on many levels. It is delicious, easy to prepare, takes about 10 minutes, and tastes good every time. As a side dish it goes with many different meals. Couscous is a healthy grain, with a lower glycemic index than rice or potatoes, and it is pretty hard to wreck during cooking. I did not eat pine nuts before trying this dish, but now I love them. Buying  this 12-pack from amazon is much cheaper ($1.94 per box) than buying the boxes individually at our local market ($4.25 each)!As other reviewers point out, this is still an expensive way to eat couscous, because you pay for the little spice packet, the packaging, and probably the promotional budget of Near East as well. For inexpensive couscous you can buy it in bulk, measure it out, season it yourself, plus you can throw in any spare vegetables or fruit you have on hand. If you are like me, some of those spare veggies might otherwise be neglected until they grow fuzzy, and get thrown into the compost heap.When I am tired or rushed for time, this is just the ticket for a well balanced meal. Near East has better quality than the other couscous vendors I have tried, and the pine nut is my favorite of their flavors.

"Nicholas Sparks writes about ordinary people. They are not attractive, rich, extraordinary or extremely evil. They don't run with the rich and famous. They live ordinary lives, like most of us, but their lives touch the extraordinary in all of us, and remind us that we, and those around us, are miraculous. It may not be great literature, but I like to read these stories for a reminder of what is really important in life.  His characters come to life, and you feel for them like you feel for a friend. Their stories may be triumphant or heartbreaking, but they are invariably good stories, well told. I am grateful that Mr. Sparks writes the way he does.I didn't like Ira, the main character, in the opening chapter.

"I enjoyed this story, and felt myself drawn into it at times, but it is not written for adults. Young teens who are good readers will enjoy it. The Tower of the Five Orders is a solid adventure story with strong characters, plus some real history, geography and literature. It is a well written and wholesome alternative to the demonology and death novels that are aimed at this age group.This is the second in a series of mysteries, following The Secrets of Shakespeare's Grave, wherein our heroine Colophon Letterford continues to search for the family treasure, in an effort to save her father's job and her family's reputation. She is an entertaining and likeable character, full of determination and courage. Her adventures take her from Oxford College to the sewers of London, pursued by a nefarious relative who wants to steal the treasure for himself. There is a good buildup of suspense, some action and adventure, one episode of understated violence (a knock on the head) and a satisfying conclusion.The story includes brief mentions of William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe,the Bodlean library, and other literate topics, which might invite the curious to read more on their own. These elements are incorporated into the story without being overly didactic or pedantic. The novel maintains a fast, entertaining pace. Deron Hicks is a quality writer. I recommend this to all young readers, and those who love them. But read the Secrets of Shakespeare's Grave first. That will make everything more clear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RB3LY2WKEX5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547839537#wasThisHelpful","R1RB3LY2WKEX5J","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are artists who can create the likeness of a person or place with a few skillful lines, conjuring up an entire world with a deceptively simple presentation. Haruf is such an artist, although his medium is words, not lines. In Benediction he continues with his spare, precise prose, He brings us into the world of the high plains in Colorado, the dry desert where people try to make a living out of the sun scorched land. He breathes life into a man who grew up desperately poor in Kansas, and although he makes mistakes, pushes people away, and keeps them there, he changes, and he is changed. There are no momentous happenings in the story, just a plain, unadorned reality.The sub plot involving a minister from Denver was an unfortunate distraction in this story. I never had the sense that he was a real character, a person with motivation and personality. Although he gets a lot of time in the narrative, his inner workings and his past remain obscure. He remains one dimensional. His actions came almost without explanation. The reaction of his congregation to his last sermon seemed stilted and artificial. It stood in stark contrast to the main story. If Harup had left this out, his short novel would have been even better.I didn't like this novel as much as Plainsong, but that does not make it better or worse. I recognize the author's considerable talent, his unusual but effective way of telling a story, and the discipline that he applies to his writing. I recommend this to all interested readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5N3BII3EHI81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307959880#wasThisHelpful","R5N3BII3EHI81","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katzen is famous for her Moosewood cookbooks, for introducing vegetarian cooking to a wide audience, helping to bring it out of the earth shoes and granola era into the mainstream. Although the early recipes suffered a bit from blandness, 35 years of experimentation has brought great improvements. Her recipes are mostly simple, easy to follow, and frequently delicious. She writes well, if that can be said about a cookbook, and she gets right to the point with clear, uncluttered prose.I particularly enjoyed her advice on making your own soup stock. I have tried the French Cordon Bleu way, which seems overly complicated and fussy. Katzen's stocks don't take nearly as long, and give you a simple, delicious result. My other favorite recipe is the ginger-pecan mini biscuits. They are easy to make and delicious.There is still something that bothers me about this book. When Katzen writes that the reader can feel ""virtuous"" for their cooking habits, she betrays a prevalent modern attitude. Some vegetarians believe that they represent a higher life form. But humility is one of the heavenly virtues, so she might find a better word than virtuous to describe their behaviors. Katzen softens the smugness with self deprecating humor, which makes this book easier to read, and more enjoyable.There are  many reasons to eat vegetables in preference to meat. Good taste has to be somewhere near the top of the list, or I just won't do it, no matter how healthy it might be. The Heart of the Plate gave me lots of  delicious reasons. I am keeping this one in my kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4M26UD1P4DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547571593#wasThisHelpful","R1M4M26UD1P4DN","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the years leading up to the Civil War, Kansas was a lawless, bleeding frontier, riven by warring pro- and anti- slavery factions. People supporting one or the other side poured in to take part in the fighting. One of those was a wild eyed militant anti slaver from the east named John Brown. He believed that he received messages directly from God, and that he was on a divinely inspired mission to eliminate slavery. Unfortunately he was not averse to killing innocent people along the way. In this fictional account of that brief and violent campaign, a young black slave is caught up in the fight, and narrates his adventures to a later audience.McBride is a wonderful writer. His first book The Color of Water, was autobiographical. It remains one of my favorite books. He brings all of his considerable skill to the writing of The Good Lord Bird. I was engrossed from the first chapter. The plot follows the historical trail of the crazy abolitionist with great accuracy, and although the author has necessarily embellished the details to flesh out the characters, he remains faithful to the actual events and period details. The main character, nicknamed Onion, is invented, but he is a marvelous storyteller and an entertaining adventurer. The tale is darkly violent by necessity, but very funny in unexpected ways. Onion is a lot like Huck Finn, and McBride has far reaching talents as a writer, just like Samuel Clemons.  Reading this book gives the reader an immediate sense of our nation in 1859, bringing to bright life the people and living conditions in our already war torn nation. We witness the strained relations between slaves and free, black and white, pro and anti slavery factions,and all manner of unexpected divisions that people made, and still make.I love the way some authors can bring the past alive for us, transporting the reader to a different time and place. The sights and sounds are important, but more important are the people, their attitudes and  reactions. James McBride has re-created the past in The Good Lord Bird, and we are the willing beneficiaries of his enormous talent. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25B575HKJU44M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594486344#wasThisHelpful","R25B575HKJU44M","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story is full of humor and honesty.

I finished the book in two days. I recommend this story for everyone, especially anyone who has dreams about moving back to nature and growing their own food.

"Theft of rare books may not garner the same headlines as murder, White House investigations, and American Idol, but it is a fascinating subject, one that most people would never imagine. Librarians have been fighting a losing battle for generations against a determined and relentless group of thieves, who steal any book that might be resold for a little money. Many times they try to destroy the record of the book too, so that the library cannot discover that they have been burglarized.Although it is easy to lapse into nostalgia about the long lost book row in Manhattan's lower 4th ave, this story exposes a less salubrious side to the trade: dealing in stolen goods. It is surprising how many dealers were willing to overlook the checkered past of some rare and valuable items.McDade has done a yeoman's job researching this never before told tale of literary larceny. I enjoyed reading about the characters involved, the history of that time and place, and the story of rare books. All are covered in great detail within this volume. I found it enjoyable, but I admit that this is not necessarily a story for everyone.

"Easy Rawlins is an easy guy to follow as he drifts through the underside of Los Angeles, looking for his quarry. The quarry is not always a bad guy, because almost everyone is a little bit bad in these novels, but whomever his client wants him to find. He has a checkered past, having grown up ""in a hard place"" which lends a certain outlook to his character. Unfortunately he has a character fault that ruins the positive aspects of these books. He simmers with a racial hatred that permeates his thoughts and his actions. He tries to do the right thing in most circumstances, except when he is angry, or under the influence. He is not above a fantasy about killing a white liquor store owner who reminds him of Grouch Marx, revealing the racism and anti Semitism that seems to come not just from Easy, but directly from the author.  Misunderstanding, fear, and rage against another because of their race is an evil force in anyone's heart, and Easy has plenty of evil forces surging through him.Aside from that, Easy is presented as a good guy, who tries to do the right thing, sticks up for victims, and rescues those who need rescue. This story moves along at a relaxed pace. It is not a page turner, but it did hold my interest. The plot and the dialogue, the description and the characterization are all skillfully done. Easy makes occasional comments that reveal an active intelligence and a wide ranging intellect. The story is more thoughtful than most mysteries, and more interesting.Mosley is a skillful and gifted writer. I was hooked by the first paragraph. Normally you don't expect good writing in a mystery, particularly a hardboiled detective story like those in the Easy Rawlins series. But Mosley has a way of writing beautifully and brutally in the same sentence. He speaks with an authentic voice, and speaks it well. All the problems and pathos of the urban desert that makes such a large part of 20th century America comes to a boil in these novels. It is a shame that some of those problems damage an otherwise excellent novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27W4483VKNLEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535988#wasThisHelpful","R27W4483VKNLEU","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, a veteran of the Afghan conflict who served in the US Air Force, presents a powerful alternative to our fumbling approach in the graveyard of empires, making an impassioned plea for a novel strategy. She knows the country, the languages, and the customs like few Americans do, since she lived in Afghanistan before 9-11, speaks most of the languages, and understands the people. She also writes beautifully, concisely, and effectively. Before I read this, I felt that we were hopelessly wasting lives, time and money in that far off place.  Farzana Marie convinced me that I was wrong.Published almost simultaneously with William Dalyrmple's Return of a King, a history of Afghanistan that reads like a novel, Farzana's book is a history that reads like a military report, concentrated and succinct. Both authors know their subject intimately, and both reveal the human comedy and tragedy that is Afghanistan. If American military leaders would pay attention to Farzana's ideas, this could be a breakthrough into winning the ""hearts and minds"" of the local people that we once sought. I remain sanguine about our chances there. Even as violence and extremism continue to claim our young men and women, Americans have decided to think about other things. It is sobering to contemplate the absence of Afghanistan in American media and politics during the last election. Our president said that this was a fight worth winning, and that he cared about it deeply, but actions speak louder than words, and he now appears to care more about golf than he does about Afghanistan. I single him out because he is our president; it is likely that most of our leaders will ignore this war, and never hear important advice like that contained in this book. We will become only the latest empire to waste its youth and wealth on a losing cause.This book presents some detailed methods for approaching, engaging and relating to Afghans, taking their culture into account. Although there are some American soldiers who do engage the locals, that approach can be damaging to a military career. Most Americans are intent on getting out alive, a reasonable strategy for an individual, but a recipe for disaster when applied to an army. Our established practice of creating armed camps, dealing with corrupt leaders, and ignoring local people will not win many converts. Even those Afghans who cooperated with the US are in jeopardy since we announced our withdrawal.If you want to know what is going on in Afghanistan now, read this book. If you are interested in an alternate strategy, read this book. It reads quickly, and it reads well. When you finish it you will understand more about our efforts in that unlucky country than you would after months of reading our media, mainstream or otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACHZT1OKIXJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3XIHQG#wasThisHelpful","R3ACHZT1OKIXJY","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love learning about new things, and I have trouble staying focused on anything long enough to become an expert. Therefore I must confess a weakness for the ubiquitous yellow and black ""Dummies"" books. They cover just about everything now. Although I never liked their use of the dummies word, and I could have suggested lots of better choices, it has become iconic, and it won't change. Thirty years hence a movie set in this decade will date itself when an actor waves one of these books around.Urban gardening is hot right now, with failed cities like Detroit turning back into farmland, and lots of bytes spilled about climate change. Environmentalists mostly live in cities. Although we really care about the environment, we find it inconvenient to actually live in it. So we can grow lots of stuff in our tiny plots of yard, porches, balconies or windows. This is the right book for getting started, telling you what you can grow, where to put it, and how to tend it. It assumes no prior knowledge. If you have lots of prior knowledge then you should not buy this book: it is mostly concerned with the basics.I like this book series because they offer quality at a reasonable price: good, informal writing, excellent organization, instructions I can understand, and a sense of humor. These are not page-turners, unless you are really into the subject. Nor do they have pictures. I have several expensive gardening books full of nice pictures, but they didn't tell me what I needed to know. Now they sit on a shelf, waiting to be donated to the friends of the local library. My Dummies book is already getting dog-eared.

"Trans Atlantic is historical fiction. It starts with several disparate stories that are separated by many miles and many years, seemingly unrelated to each other. Each is completely adsorbing, but I could not see the connection for quite a while. Eventually the author ties them together in a fascinating and satisfying way.McCann's storytelling is immersive, with vivid portraits of people and places. He maintains a tight focus each scene, like a series of snapshots. You get a lot of detail, but you only see what the author wants you to see. The point of view goes from person to person, while the voice remains the same. Much is left unseen and unsaid. The sentences are spare, short and devoid of artifice. They are occasionally expansive and poetic, but more often prosaic, carefully trimmed. He requires some adaptation from his readers, an effort that I was glad to provide. The rewards are considerable.Using historical people is a difficult challenge in a work of fiction, because the author loses a lot of freedom. If the author deviates from the known personality, the story loses its verisimilitude. McCann handles these characters with consummate skill. He plunges into their minds, revealing their thoughts, impressions, and feelings. I was fascinated by Frederick Douglas' journey through Ireland at the onset of the great famine, his ambivalent reaction to the Anglo-Irish, his shock at the wildness and poverty of the great mass of people.Transatlantic does not contain straightforward plotting and prose, geared for the popular fiction market. It is nevertheless easy enough to read. One of my friends related that her book club rejected his previous novel, Let the Great World Spin, because it was ""too intense.""

"This is a wonderful and true story about the 1936 University of Washington varsity crew, eight young men who rowed into history. Daniel James Brown writes so well that history becomes personal, the distant past becomes immediate, and the now dead men and women are alive again in the mind of the reader. He describes the sport of rowing in great detail and with accuracy, no mean feat for someone who never rowed. His writing is comparable to David Halberstam, author of The Amateurs, in quality and in scope. In fact, Mr. Brown has surpassed him with this book. The author, who is unfortunate enough to share a name with Dan Brown of DaVinci Code infamy, does a thorough report on the men in the boat, their families, their coaches, the history of the 1930's, and the science of sport.Many of the old luminaries of American rowing are in this story, the good, the bad, and the legendary, including Hiram Conibear, Tom Bolles, Al Ulbrickson and George Pocock. The story of the Pocock racing shell, which was still the best racing boat in the US when I started rowing, is detailed, along with the life story of George Pocock, his personality, and his contributions to Washington crews.At times the author gets a bit over enthusiastic, and comes close to melodrama. Some of the rowing details were overwrought, particularly during the races. He describes the crews as ""furiously hacking at the choppy water..."" That doesn't describe the sport of rowing, except for raw beginners. Nevertheless, I only have minor complaints: it is a well written story.This is a recommended read for anyone who has suffered through a season of rowing. It brought back all the anxiety of fighting for a seat in the boat, the hours of self doubt, the pain of training in bad weather, with bad combinations of rowers, and the joy of getting it right, feeling the boat fly. This is an inspirational story, one that will lift you up, and it is wonderful, not only because Brown is a great writer, but because it is true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MKJMC75VMFTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067002581X#wasThisHelpful","R3MKJMC75VMFTH","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main character of this novel, Hannah Price, is based on Maria Mitchell, a woman born into a Quaker community on Nantucket in 1818. She eventually leaves to pursue her dream of becoming a leading astronomer and the first female professor at Vassar College, an extraordinarily difficult feat for a woman in that time and place.The author has studied the history and the location, because many of the details align with actual events. She includes small details from Sweeper in the Sky, the occasionally melodramatic 1949 biography of Miss Mitchell. Some of the characters are invented, especially Edward, her brother and Isaac, her love interest, which may bother readers. In defense of Ms. Brill, much of Mitchell's personal life has to be imagined, because after her death, her sister destroyed all of her writings that she considered personal, ""to make it proper.""The story suffers from anachronisms. I hoped to hear the voice of a 19th century woman, but Hannah often thinks and talks like a 21st century person. When Hannah's father (mildly) objected to her walking at night with a dark skinned sailor, Hannah reacts angrily, because she always considered her father ""tolerant, even progressive"" about race. The reaction was realistic, but is a modern discussion, not something a person would say in 1840. The progressive era was 50 years in the future, and even then the word progressive meant something radically different than the way people use it today. More jarringly, I doubt that a father in that time and place would have reacted mildly in that situation. Especially a father in a Quaker congregation that forbid marriage to non-Quakers, one that expelled women for wearing a colorful bow in their hair.The story takes place in a deeply religious community, but only rarely in 370 pages does a person mention God. His name is not invoked in daily conversation, or even in church. Was Hannah a believer, an agnostic, or an atheist? The author avoids this question for most of the novel. Hannah's decision to leave the congregation is a central event, but it was not a crisis of faith.Amy Brill is a good writer, but for all of the passion in the life of Maria Mitchell, the novel has an emotional flatness to it. One reviewer remarked upon her desire to like this story more than she actually did, because it was ""right up my feminist alley."" The author describes a woman who lives more in her head than her heart.  The final effect of the writing leaves the reader with a catharsis of emotion. Catharsis is fitting in Greek tragedy, but I had hoped for more in the life of Maria Mitchell.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207Y66MYDFESU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487448#wasThisHelpful","R207Y66MYDFESU","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected a light hearted comedy about a pair of brothers who were con artists, and that is what this movie represents, but only in part. It also has a slightly serious side, with some real emotion and sadness. The lack of morality that underlies the entire premise of the movie bothered me, however. This is true of many movies about the (somewhat) bad guys who are supposed to be the good guys. You have to be willing to pretend that the bad things they do don't matter. The characters build their lives on lies, which makes it harder to believe anything they say. It also makes it harder to sympathize with them. Once you do that, a friend assured me, the movie becomes very entertaining.I did not reach that oblivious place. My problem is not with the nature of the characters, for many great stories are built on flawed characters. My problem was with the nature of the screenwriters, who want you to accept the lies as just another lifestyle choice.This is a professional production, with excellent acting, plotting and filming. The plot is complex, with lots of unknowns, revelations and head scratching on the part of the viewer. In the end there is some ambiguity. If you watch the movie a second time, you will understand more, but there is lots of room for discussion and disagreement.

"I was looking forward to this book with great anticipation, so some disillusionment was inevitable. I found some chapters difficult to follow, and re-read a lot, because  I would find myself repeatedly in the middle of a page, with no idea what the writer was going on about. Often this happens because I am not paying attention, but in this book it happens because the author cannot stay on topic.This is not a novel, nor a nonfiction tome, but a series of disconnected musings on life, literature, and meaning, told with lots of personal asides by the author. In fact his personal life and inner musings are not really asides, they are the main course.The tone of the writer put me off. I don't have to like a writer or their writing to acknowledge ability, or greatness. David Shields has ability, but not greatness. He can be smug, as when he compares himself to Bart Giamotti (but as a parent, not as an actor). He can be creepy, as when he stole into his girlfriend's room to read her diary, not just once but repeatedly. Then he used that knowledge to woo her. He does not excuse this behavior, but he is not exactly penitential either. I simply could not trust this man.In everything he thinks about it, analyzes it, exhausts it, until he becomes a bit like his own version of the greatest book ever written.  Maybe I am not a good enough reader to appreciate this writer.

"This new author has great talent, the ability to create a scene, a world, or a character that absorbs the reader and transports them to a new place, the place of the author's creation. There is a genuine skill in her prose that invites the reader into her stories, bids them sit and stay, takes their imagination and fuels it with ready sustenance. She reads like a writer who has been perfecting her craft for many years.The author uses her talent to create a tale of woe. The world that the author creates is one of debauchery, despair and death, fueled by alcohol, racism and constant conflict. There is plenty of casual sex, straight and gay, lots of sweat from the Georgia swelter, and a shadowy presence of evil, personified by the thinly described white people. In this story men and white people vie for supremacy in evil deeds. The main characters endure years of misery, oppression and hopelessness.The Oprah book club has chosen the subject it usually chooses. The story illuminates just how awful the United States was, how awful it is, how awful men and white people will always be. But it really isn't their fault. They are all victims. Like the young, disfigured boy named Six, the preacher, who was ""especially wronged and especially indignant."" This author creates a nation of Sixes. Some of the details of Ms. Mathis' stories are skillful wrought and believable, but she gets other things jarringly wrong. In this world of Ms. Mathis, even the gift of the Holy Spirit can be evil. Fair is foul and foul is fair.My best friend read this for her book club, and advised me not to read it. I should have taken her advice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMAOMTESH7JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350287#wasThisHelpful","R2DMAOMTESH7JE","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are pictures spanning the century, showing people in every decade, under every condition, engaged in everyday life, the struggle for survival, and outright warfare. You cannot look through this book without being enormously affected. The prose is well done, a personal summary of the century by the author, who writes well, never pretending to be impartial, but completely involved and knowledgeable, telling a story that is worth reading. If you want a one book summary of Ireland during the 1900's, I don't think you can find a better one than this.

"This movie was a bad concept, a Hollywood version of a modern, wealthy Manhattan power couple who are forced to go to a red state. They have to be forced, because who would go to a red state voluntarily? There they are flabbergasted by all kinds of new experiences, like a visit to a Costco/Wal-Mart store. The portrayal of small town America is pathetic, but I shouldn't have expected anything else. I blame myself for even considering this movie.I used to be a Hugh Grant fan. He did a wonderful job in About a Boy, and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Unfortunately, he does not just play awkward and aging badly, in this film he really is awkward and aging badly. Sarah Jessica Parker, never my favorite actress, does herself no favors. Mary Steenbergen  is unconvincing as a gun toting, horse riding country woman. Sam Elliott looks like he is resigned to his fate.They must have realized how bad the scrip was, because the actors are so uncomfortable that I actually felt uncomfortable watching them.

"Initally I had trouble with the title of this book, because it seemed awkward and meaningless. The explanation comes in the early chapters: ship it is a poker term meaning push my winnings to me, and Holla is a word that a young poker champ, nickname Raptor, uses as an online greeting, because Eminem uses it, and he believes that Eminem is really cool. Ballas are a rap term for cool guys, although they would certainly sneer at ""cool guys.""This is a real life example of how an advance in technology changes the lives of a few talented and opportunistic individuals, allowing them to exploit something that didn't exist a few years ago, making themselves rich and famous, if only for a while. The U.S. government swooped in and shut down the party. It is a good story nevertheless, even if it is history now. Perhaps online poker will rise again.The authors follow the lives of several online poker wizards, men who could make a small fortune by cranking out game after game, winning more often than they lost. You never do find out what their strategy was, how they maintained an edge over all the other players who thought they could strike it rich. You won't even learn the mechanics of poker here. For that information the authors provide a few references, but few details. This is the story of the winners, not the story of how to win. It is well written, entertaining, and reads quickly.

"This is a funny, entertaining, and scientifically literate introduction to the life of an astronaut, or more precisely, the way to keep an astronaut alive and well. Far from the romantic ideal of a star trek adventure, life in space has often been uncomfortable, disorienting and just plain boring. I enjoyed reading as Ms. Roach tagged along in parabolic flight (which gives a temporary sense of weightlessness), rode in Tom Cruise's stunt plane (did she really hurl her lunch into his chiseled face?), and After reading this book, I had a much understanding of the technical details of astronaut life, which adds to my fascination with space travel, but makes me happy that I never actually got on board.Some parts of this book are not for the faint of stomach. Skip chapter six if you are the least bit susceptible to suggestions of nausea. There she dwells on the topic to the point of obsession. I once viewed a lecture on the subject by an anesthesiologist, wherein he rattled off over a dozen silly euphemisms for the act of losing your lunch, at which point the crowd had grown abnormally silent, except for a few anesthesiologists who were still laughing. Ms. Roach, I suspect, would be one of them. This is not a chapter to dwell upon.The author writes well, with a slightly excessive use of footnotes, which are required reading, because that is where a lot of the humor resides. I confess that I love the way Ms. Roach writes, and consider her a kindred spirit, but I admit that this is not for everyone. If you are a nerd, in any slight degree, or full on, this is a book that you will treasure. I was going to pass it on to someone, but after reading it, I have to keep it in my personal library.

"These water storage units are at the upper limit of size for portable water storage. Selling for approximately $2.50 per gallon of storage, they are a fairly good internet deal (another reviewer says that Wal-Mart sells them for 12.99). They are tough, durable, and yet weigh next to nothing when empty. I bought them for emergency water in case of an earthquake, or similar disaster. They stack (although the manufacturer says only stack them when empty, I have them two deep and full for several years without a leak) and take up little floor space, but I put them against a wall for stability.They are good for casual camping, if you have a nearby water source. Seven gallons will satisfy a city-slicker family of four overnight, unless someone wants to take a shower. When full, they weigh almost 60 lbs, and they are too wide to carry easily: they dig into your leg and essentially hobble you. You can put a pole through the handle and make them into a two person carry, but it would be a lot better to have a pack mule. The mule probably won't like them either. This is not a practical backpacking solution, because they are just too big.I have had mine for over four years now. There was an initial plastic smell and taste, even after washing out, but that is long gone. Now the water comes out tasting like it went in. Aside from some dust, they are as good as new: there is no evidence of degradation of the plastic yet.The spout is a handy design, on the reverse face of the screw-in cap. As others have mentioned, it doesn't always face downwards when tightened. You can take it off and restart the threading process at a different rotation, but it won't always face straight down. We just put a rock under one side of the container to realign the spout when necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5F0LQZP6A3DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QC31G6#wasThisHelpful","R5F0LQZP6A3DD","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good movie, one that I watched on DVD. My kids are too old to watch Disney movies now, but I'm not. My wife watched it with me, and we were captivated by the story, the brave, bold young woman who makes a foolish choice, then pays for it, makes amends, andâ€¦ well I won't ruin the story. It was well done, with a strong story line, good, believable characters, an adventure that will keep you watching, a struggle between good and evil, both internal and external.There are lots of sly jokes for the adults, which were truly funny. All the males in the film are treated like bumbling simpletons, which is a pernicious but officially sanctioned form of sexism today. I was willing to overlook it here, because the story was such a good one. The true story of the making of this film is a cautionary tale, because Brenda Chapman, the person who conceived this story based on her relationship with her daughter, started as the director of the film, but was shut out from the final product. Doesn't seem fair, but that is the way they do business in the movies. The final product is a good one, no matter how many bodies lie beneath the parking lot at the studio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK4BPPF86ZOV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YWY0HK#wasThisHelpful","RK4BPPF86ZOV9","A1QQEFV51EMD7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QQEFV51EMD7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author spent many years in a state of severe deafness, unaware of his hearing problem. This is the story of his life, an unusual life to be sure. Shea provides a lot of information in an entertaining and easy to read format. He describes the science of hearing and language, the history about the deaf community, the history of education in that community, and most importantly, his own personal history.It was difficult for me to accept the author's cluelessness about his hearing problems. I too have an acquired hearing loss, not as severe as the author's,  and I am reminded of it daily. I remember sitting in class, hearing very little, wondering how I would ever pass this course. But there was never a moment's doubt that I had a hearing loss. Mr. Shea went on for 30 years without a clue about his profound deafness. I am not saying it didn't happen. I just have a hard time believing it.I didn't like the author's voice. I didn't enjoy this book, although I found a fellow sufferer, someone who shares a common experience with me. Someone close to me suggested that it hit too close to home, but I don't think that is the reason for my dissatisfaction. I found the writing style to be highly idiosyncratic. I suppose you should expect that from a social outcast, a person who misunderstands most of what people say to him.

"I only have the Brandenburg Concerti from this Andrew Parrott set and normally wouldnâ€™t review a re-released set that includes the Suites which I havenâ€™t heard.  But I wanted to add a few comments because Amazon shoppers are faced with two wildly divergent evaluations so far, the negative one with the usual bunch of down-votes for critical opinions.Well, I agree with the negative review.  This is a mechanical and thoroughly mediocre version of JS Bachâ€™s six famous Brandenburg Concerti from Parrott and the Taverner Players.  The recording is not helped by a shallow sound engineering job with no trace of richness or depth.The performance flaws involve Parrottâ€™s typewriter-like presentation of Bachâ€™s meter and rhythm as well as flawed playing by many of the individual Taverner Players.  The orchestraâ€™s technical weaknesses are exposed in the finale of the 1st Brandenburg Concerto, where the sections put the spotlight on the isolated groupings.  There are ensemble problems, sloppy cut-offs and, over and above these problems, a general lack of finesse.  The inexpressive and metronomic rhythmic aspect of the performance can be heard in the very beautiful opening movement of the 3rd Brandenburg Concerto.  The rhythm punches along, nary a sign of expression anywhere.  For example, the Vivaldi-like section (at 3â€™45â€) is rushed through, the warm sound of the massed strings intended to provide a climax. In Parrottâ€™s hands, it is done at mezzo forte with clinical metronomic precision.These flaws all seem to exacerbate each other.  The orchestral playing can be ragged and lacking in richness â€“ this is compounded by the poor sonics. The Brandenburg Concerti, as fine as they are, can sound machine-lie â€“ this is compounded by Parrottâ€™s metric insensitivity.  You can tell I didnâ€™t like this recoding one bit.  Not recommended.  The Suites may be better but theyâ€™d need to be a whole lot superior to the Brandenburg Concerti to make this set worthwhile.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14APK2F5LJDN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002ZZ58#wasThisHelpful","R14APK2F5LJDN9","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This disc is marked for me by the three impressive chorales, each very different, which open the cantatas.  The biggest and most ambitious composition here is the â€œO Ewigkeitâ€ Cantata (#20, 1724) and the eponymous chorale with which it begins shows JS Bachâ€™s contrapuntal mastery on full display.  Bach writes a full French overture for orchestra, with the slow sections distinguished by dotted rhythms opening and concluding the chorale, and faster fugal section comprising the inner core.  On top of this overture, he layers a hymn-like composition for chorus, in slow even notes.  The idea harkens back to medieval forms using the cantus firmus, but in its high baroque incarnation in â€œO Ewigkeitâ€, it is an imposing and majestic creation â€“ as if two different compositions were welded together - from a great polyphonic writer.The opening chorales for Cantatas 2 and 176 are shorter and less ambitious â€“ but they are beautiful, too.  Cantata 176 is introduced by a very dramatic chorale which reminds me of the more impassioned parts of the Brandenburg Concerti.  The chorale for Cantata 2 is more plaintive and emotional, and is affecting because of that.The performances are thoroughly and consistently top notch, as one would expect from Philippe Herreweghe and the Collegium Musicum.  Bass Peter Kooy is very strong, of course.  The duet â€œO Menschenkindâ€ from Cantata 20 (track 16) is one of the best numbers in this release and soprano Johanette Zomer and tenor Jan Kobow do very good work to bring out its beauty.  The orchestral playing and choral singing from the Collegium Vocale is strong and accomplished throughout and the sound engineering is excellent.  All involved are pros and the results show it.It took a while for me to warm up to this disc.  The Cantatas found here, all written for the Trinity services in 1724 and 1725, are not as accessible as others from Bach.  There is something austere and ungiving about some of the recitatives and solo numbers.  So I would recommend the disc for cognoescenti.  I am an admirer of Herrewegheâ€™s efforts in his consistently excellent partial survey of Bachâ€™s sacred music and would recommend the â€œTrauer Odeâ€ CD (cantatas 78 and 198) or the release on Virgin Classics (cantatas 73, 107 & 131) as better choices for less involved listeners.  I compared Cantatas 2 and 20 here with the performances in the Ton Koopman complete cycles and, while I preferred the Koopmans opening chorale in Cantata 20 to Herrewegheâ€™s version due to its liveliness and sense of occasion, Herrewegheâ€™s is overall more beautiful and certainly more consistently polished across the cantatas.  (For example, the soprano/tenor duet in Cantata 20 which I describe above is in Koopmanâ€™s version rough and not always very attractive.)  This is a successful and very worthwhile effort from Herreweghe and his musicians.  Kudos to everyone involved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQS5TTRRFB4E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008DHRJ#wasThisHelpful","RQS5TTRRFB4E7","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I donâ€™t consider this release to be quite up there with Maria Joao Piresâ€™ very finest recordings, that is a high standard.  This 1996 selection of Frederic Chopinâ€™s beautiful Nocturnes is worthwhile and at times terrific, exhibiting Piresâ€™ sensitive musicality and her wonderful rhythmic fluidity.The pair of Op. 9 Nocturnes that open the disc particularly successfully fit Piresâ€™ strengths.  Consisting almost entirely of melody and accompaniment texture â€“ the right hand presenting the melody supported by arpeggiations in the case of Op. 9/1 and chords in Op. 9/2 â€“ Piresâ€™ ability to sensitively introduce rhythmic inflections into the lead line heightens the Nocturnesâ€™ expressivity and variety.  Piresâ€™ mastery of touch and color is also impressive.  In the crescendo that concludes Op. 55/1, she shifts from one timbre to another to create an effect of two different voices alternating, something which I had never heard before.  I also very much liked the playing of the Op. 32/2 Nocturne where Pires presents the outside section in an utterly musical way and then transitions into that awesome middle section which she presents with sweep and power.  Piresâ€™ Op. 32/2 may be the best recording of this Nocturne Iâ€™ve heard and justifies the release just by itself.While there are many terrific Nocturnes here, not all of it in my opinion works so well.  I was expecting the limpid Op. 15/2 Nocturne to be an awesome version given Piresâ€™ talents, but I thought it was taken a tad too quickly and aggressively, with the pacing just not quite right.  An alternative version of Op. 15/2 by Yuri Egorov captures the magic of this Nocturne, which epitomizes Chopinâ€™s efforts in the genre.  The two big Nocturnes gathered together in Op. 27, forming some of Chopinâ€™s best music, would also seem to be perfectly suited for Pires.  While she does a good job, her performance doesnâ€™t capture the power and mystery of my favorite interpretation of Op. 27/1 (Arthur Rubinstein) or the heart-wrenching sadness of Op. 27/2 (Dinu Lipatti, of course).  This is high level criticism; I am unfavorably comparing Pires to some of the great piano recordings ever set down on tape, so take it in context.  Piresâ€™ approach to Op. 27/2 is quite a bit different from Lipattiâ€™s, in fact, emphasizing the sensuous atmosphere of the main section and the dynamic build-ups rather than emotional intensity and sadness.  I imagine some listeners would prefer it.  One of the other weaknesses is a substandard sound engineering job from DG, unfortunately typical of this label.  Piresâ€™ sound is muddied and the pedal thumped in my subwoofer.Expectations always matter.  Given my profound admiration for Piresâ€™ pianism and how her natural gifts and inclinations match Chopinâ€™s writing style in the Nocturnes, I had anticipated this would be one of the best Chopin recordings I had ever heard.  Instead, it has some wonderful and sublime tracks mixed with other overaggressive, even hasty ones.  Canâ€™t win them all -- but Pires certainly wins some of them.  The high points are what really matters, though, so Iâ€™m assigning this 5 stars without hesitations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STIOTVNIN0K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013816GA#wasThisHelpful","R2STIOTVNIN0K7","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This installment in Masaaki Suzukiâ€™s cycle of JS Bach cantatas features one of my favorite of all of them, BWV 64, an austere and tragic work with an exceptional soprano aria (â€œWas die weltâ€) along with BWV 25, a cantata that was new to me but which I very much enjoyed discovering.  The three other works, the celebratory BWV 69a, the BWV 77 and a fragment for chorus designated as BWV 50, struck me as less impressive while still being solid Bach.  The five were all written in 1723 and 1724, so are unified chronologically.  The cantatas included range in quality but there are some real highlights in Bachâ€™s cantata writing.How is the performance?  This is my first exposure to Suzukiâ€™s performances and Iâ€™d rate it as good but not great.  The performances are well executed throughout, with very adept solo singing, but the interpretations sometimes donâ€™t present the full intensity and power inherent in them.The Cantata 64 is stunning, from its initial and gripping chorale through the soprano aria I mentioned to a very beautiful alto aria with obligatto oboe solo.  Suzuki takes the work faster than in my favorite interpretation, an old German LP,  making the presentation a tad pedestrian.  The opening chorale flows along nicely but without special intensity.  The soprano aria (â€œWas die weltâ€), with its memorable ritornello in the strings, is walked through a pretty nimble pace.  This robs the music of its full meaning, a protest against the cruelty of the world.  The bass recitative is underperformed, a bit lackluster and neutral.  But Suzuki does better than what I think is another flawed interpretation, the inelegant one from Nikolas Harnoncourt.This levels sets the Suzuki. It is not as good as the really excellent or profound Bach cantatas I have heard, but itâ€™s better than quite a few alternatives.  For example, I compared the very attractive Cantata 25 to the performance led by Ton Koopman in that conductorâ€™s cycle.  Suzuki is more musical and sensitive than Koopman, and benefits from some fine solo performances.  Soprano Yukari Nonoshita gives us a technically accomplished version of the BWV 25 soprano aria (â€œOffne meinen, track 13) and star bassist Peter Kooy is mostly outstanding, with a light touch in the bass aria from BWV 69a, (â€œMein Erloser:, track 19), which, though it lies high in his range, he goes through without the slightest difficulty.So this is a solid but not exceptional release which you will likely enjoy, especially because of the wonderful Cantatas 25 and 64.  The release is from 1999 and is done in very good sound.

"This 1950 collaboration between three stars â€“ Jascha Heifetz on violin, Grigor Piatigorsky on cello, Arthur Rubinstein on piano â€“ features two very similar piano trios written in the key of A minor.  The disc begins with the later Trio from Maurice Ravel, written in 1914, and concludes with the hefty example from Piotr Tchaikovsky, from 1891.  The Ravel is a fine piece, sleek and moody, while the Tchaikovsky is melodic, with a particularly memorable set of theme and variations making up its central movement.The performance is very good.  Relaxed and natural, the Ravel is done fairly slowly, a sense of ease throughout.  The Ravel Trio surprised me by reminding me quite a bit of my favorite recording of this piece, led by Andre Previn (on BMG), which is also brings out the composerâ€™s relaxed and elegant side.I have never heard a really perfect recording of the Tchaikovsky Trio.  If a reader has a version they think is outstanding, Iâ€™d welcome a comment recommending it below.  But Rubinstein, Piatigorsky and Heifetz come closest among the other versions I have.  The Tchaikovsky is done more passionately than the Ravel, as is appropriate given their respective compositional styles, yet never feels rushed or particularly agitated.  I attribute this approach to Arthur Rubinstein, a performer with an effortless style who always projects musically.  He sounds as if he had been playing piano since he lay in his crib, something which is close to being true.Piatigorsky does excellent work as well, with a rich tone.  I am less enthusiastic about Heifetzâ€™s violin playing.  As elsewhere, I find him wooden, lacking in expressivity.  Though this is a â€œsuper-groupâ€ ensemble â€“ made up of three musicians famous from their solo careers â€“ a sense of pressing and striving to be on center stage is nowhere to be found.  The trading off between the three is unpressured, with the performers putting Ravel and Tchaikovsky first and their egos in the backseat.The Trio had a short-lived career, partly thrown together because each of them, a Jewish Ã©migrÃ© from central Europe, had relocated to Beverly Hills in California, where they began rehearsing together.  Besides the exigencies of their busy solo performing careers, Rubinstein and Heifetz did not get along particularly well on a personal level, apparently.  This friction, if it existed, wasnâ€™t audible to me, although Heifetzâ€™s fiddling sometimes recedes into the background, which is surprising because the violinist is so often the lead in piano trio interpretations.The recording was made in LA in 1950 but sounds very good.  Though not a modern recording, it can be bought without fear of poor recorded sound.  This is a very good historical disc.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJ99BG7BVO2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000054276#wasThisHelpful","R1UJ99BG7BVO2I","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Italian presentation of one of Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s most important and personal collections, the 6th book of Madrigals (1614), is handicapped because it exists as an alternative to what I consider a downright great early music release, the version of the 6th Book from the Consort of Musicke led by Anthony Rooley and headlined by soprano Emma Kirkby (on Virgin Classics).  I recommend all listeners interested in madrigals to seek out the Rooley/Kirkby, a stunningly beautiful, ornate and polished interpretation.  The disc under review, recorded in 1992 in Bologna and conducted by leading early music specialist Rinaldo Alessandrini, is very strong in its own right and offers a type of performance and sound world distinctly different from the Consort of Musicke.There will be some listeners who in fact prefer the Alessandrini.  With the Concerto Italiano vocal group, Alessandrini avoids homogenizing the vocal timbres of the different singers in the ensemble, making for a rich variety of sound colors.  This is different from what the Consort of Musicke tries to do â€“ they present a unified texture, with the individualâ€™s vocal types subsumed into a blended texture.  There are pluses and minuses to both approaches.  The Concerto Italiano allows a quilt of different sounds to come through at all times, giving each phrase and musical paragraph a large range of colors.  I also received an impression of different people joining together to sing the ensemble pieces while preserving their individuality, a pleasing sensation.  But the Consort of Musickeâ€™s tightly controlled blend of vocal color better distinguishes between the different sections.  The tight blend also permits some of the spectacular vocal ornaments they introduce to bet set off particularly well.  The Concerto Italiano highlights the moment but variety can end up sounding ever the same; the Consort of Musicke builds large coherent spans of music, but a sense of freedom is gone within the discipline of the group.This contrast is heard in the second madrigal from the group, â€œZefiro torna,â€ a wonderful work opening with quick canon entries and ending with an ascending chromatic texture down in the ensemble range, a luxuriant and adventurous section that is the epitome of Moneteverdiâ€™s compositions.  Both versions are good, with the Concerto Italiano shining in the fast beginning.  But the Consort of Musicke succeeds in building to the chromatic concluding section, the layered sound done a bit more slowly and with greater impact.I have been commenting about the performance so far, but itâ€™s worth mentioning that the Sixth book is a truly great collection of music.  Though published in 1614, it seems to have been written over several years as a response to personal tragedy.  The collection is separated into two mini-cycles, each commemorating the death of a woman close to the composer, his wife Claudia Cattaneo in 1607 and a young adoptee and singer Caterina Martinelli the next year.  Judging from this music, Monteverdi felt the loss deeply.  The two mini-cycles each begin with a â€œmega-madrigalâ€, an ambitious setting about 15 minutes in length, elegiac in mood, complex musically and structurally.  These mega-madrigals are followed by four or five madrigals of more conventional length, each mini-cycle capped by a duet between male and female soloist.  Monteverdi is at all times a creative thinker in terms of form and structure but the layout of the 6th book points to a special intent, a personal memorial to the two women.  And the music is luscious and perfect.So this disc from Alessandrini and the Concerto Italiano is a very worthy release.  The singing strikes me as technically accomplished, with a sense of conviction throughout.  The label has given the ensemble very good engineering, to aid matters.  Texts and an interesting set of comments from Alessandrini are included with the disc.

"The first volume of Bernd Glemserâ€™s Alexander Scriabin cycle, recorded in 1994 for Naxos, is uneven.  At times, the playing is inspired and absorbing; at others, flat and wooden.The Fantasy in b minor, Op. 28 from 1900, one of Scriabinâ€™s best works, encapsulates the strengths and weaknesses of Glemserâ€™s playing.  The stormy, slow opening is inexpressive and Glemser doesnâ€™t sound fully engaged.  Then, the Fantasy transitions into a lyrical and very beautiful melody in the treble register, marked â€˜Piu vivoâ€™ and about 2â€™ into track 7, and suddenly the playing is alive and sensuously beautiful.  There are some very fine moments later on.  The complex â€˜three handsâ€™ passage about 4â€™ in, fortissimo and rousing, is presented with passion.  Later on, the â€˜Piu vivoâ€™ lyrical section is reprised and to my ears Glemser loses intensity, before he regains his enthusiasm to give us a fiery concluding section.  So the interpretation of the Fantasy is uneven.This mix of quality can be heard elsewhere.  Glemser presents a first rate 5th Sonata: the sonataâ€™s mysticism and grasping at the elusive is fully apparent, with a nice build to the final climax in the central section before the music evaporates into smoke.  The 5th is followed by one of my favorite Scriabin efforts, the 6th Sonata from 1911, with its arch-like principal melody rising up, â€œwith heatâ€ as the composer marks in the score.  The 6th was almost feared by Scriabin, who described it as â€œnightmarish, murky, uncleanâ€ but that weighted meaning, the attribution of evil to an inanimate object, is not to be found in Glemserâ€™s distracted and neutral interpretation.Glemser is clearly a talented musician but he is off and on here.  Naxos provides him with mediocre recorded sound, typical of the labelâ€™s below-par efforts from the 90s.  Distinct weaknesses combined with sections that are very nicely played.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POHGROMXENG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000145B#wasThisHelpful","R1POHGROMXENG7","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Maria Pires performance of Franz Schubert impromptus and other short pieces was expanded into a double-CD set by the label and given a separate title, â€œLe voyage magnifiqueâ€, to set it apart from rival versions and point to its special quality.  In my opinion, this is well-deserved.  Pires has given us one of her best recordings, one that ranges from the very good to the downright sublime.Piresâ€™ version of the long theme-and-variations 3rd Impromptu from the Op. 142 set illustrates her inspired playing.  She is extremely musical throughout the contrasting variations, playing with a remarkable rhythmic subtlety and fluidity.  The lead melodic line is never pat, often with slight anticipations or delays that make it really sing. But this fluidity isnâ€™t soggy; it is combined with a snappy tempo that allows variations like the 5th, marked by running sixteenth triplets in the right hand, to flow with momentum and charm.This performance of the 3rd impromptu is enough to justify the entire recording by itself but there are other terrific moments throughout.  I thought the performance of the 4th impromptu from Op. 90 was easily the best Iâ€™ve ever heard.  Just inspired pianism.  After a charming outer section, fleet and projected with utter command, Pires imbues the minor central Trio with weight and desperation.  Itâ€™s one of those outbursts of melancholy and dismay that crop up throughout Schubertâ€™s later music and Iâ€™ve never heard the Trioâ€™s intensity projected quite like it is here.  The melancholy of the Trio is in fact enhanced by the crisp approach to the delicate outer sections, so the large scale form building is there, too.One of the setâ€™s benefits for me was drawing attention to the often-overlooked D 946 pieces, which are as long individually as the more famous Impromptus.  While not quite in the Impromptusâ€™ class, there is delightful and delicious writing here.  The long first piece in E-flat minor is rendered wodnerfully by Pires.  Her utter musicality and knowledge of the piece allows a beautifully integrated -- yet soulful -- performance to come through.  I have pointed to three tracks that attracted my attention but the others are worthy, with for example Pires playing the notable 1st impromptu from the Op. 90 set very well, and generally excellent pianism throughout.The only criticism I have is that the sound engineering provided by DG is somewhat hazy and certainly not ideal.  I have gone through several performances of the Impromptus over the years, listening to the older Jorg Demus recording earlier on and listening to Alfred Brendelâ€™s strong 1970s recording more recently.  Those are worthy alternatives but the Pires is in another class, frankly.  Itâ€™s a downright great Schubert recording and one of Piresâ€™ best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YO931YWFNNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GZY#wasThisHelpful","R5YO931YWFNNM","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I certainly donâ€™t own every early music recording but do have a collection of about fifty and this 1992 recording from Anthony Rooley and the Consort of Musicke, helped by notably great singing from soprano Emma Kirkby, is at the very top.The music is sublime.  Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s 6th Book of Madrigals, published in 1614 but written over several years, is separated into two mini-cycles.  Each cycle commemorates the death of a woman close to the composer, his wife Claudia Cattaneo in 1607 and a young adoptee and singer Caterina Martinelli the following year.

Monteverdi is at all times a creative thinker in terms of form and structure but the layout of the 6th book points to a special intent, a personal memorial to the two women.  And the music is luscious and perfect.  The 6th book may be the apex of the madrigal form.The performance is splendid.  Rooley and the Consort of Musicke take a blended approach to their ensemble, one in which the individual voices are shaded into a unified sound, different from performances which accentuates each individual singerâ€™s idiosyncratic tone color rather than the groupâ€™s overall sound.  This blended approach struck me as helping to project the madrigalsâ€™ structure, allowing the building blocks and differentiation between sections to come through clearly.  The sound is lush and perfect, supported by a larger-than-normal instrumental continuo.  In his notes, Rooley sounds almost defensive when discussing his choice to use this continuo, but based on the results, he neednâ€™t have been, because it complements well the singerâ€™s full sound and the luxuriant aspect of the madrigals.  Added to this is a wonderful performance by Kirkby, technically assured and making the most of her outstanding high range.  Kirkby is an esteemed singer and her rep is certainly supported when you hear her work as lead soprano across this release.Special and memorable moments occur throughout.  One of the most spectacular is the decision by the Consort of Music to embellish some of the cadences in â€œSestina,â€ the second of the two â€œmega-madrigalsâ€, with exotic scale runs high up in Kirkbyâ€™s upper register.  This is something that stood out to me immediately when I first got this recording a couple of decades ago and I think it will stand out to most listeners, too.  The ensemble is capable of terrific coloristic touches.  Take the stanza â€œO chiome d'or,â€œ towards the end of the Sestina, where the accompaniment voices descend to a very warm and palpably solid texture while the soprano enters on a high note.  The final madrigal, â€œPresso in Fiume tranquilloâ€ contains coloristic touches used to evoke running water, another effect that is done superbly.The interpretation of â€œZefiro Torna,â€ a more bouncy and less reflective madrigal following the â€œLamento dâ€™Ariannaâ€ which opens the 6th Book, features some really nice fast passage work from the sopranos.  â€œZefiroâ€ encapsulates this recordingâ€™s excellence.  About 2 minutes in, very fine upper register singing is followed by a chromatic progression lower down with all singers engaged.  The brilliant high passage followed by the warm chromatic progression is strikingly beautiful.  The singing is musical, technically top notch and fully attuned to Monteverdiâ€™s sophisticated and luxurious pre-baroque style.The sound engineering is pretty good though not excellent.  Full liner notes including texts are included.  Despite Monteverdiâ€™s many achievements, including the wonderful â€œCoronation of Poppeaâ€, the Vespers Mass of 1610, and other fine madrigals, this 6th Book is for me his defining achievement.

"I recently had bought Rafal Blechaczâ€™s version of the Fredric Chopin Polonaises and found it one of the most gripping, wonderful piano solo recordings Iâ€™d heard in the last few years.  It had made me eager to hear more of this highly talented young Polish pianist and so I moved on to this set of three piano sonatas from the grand masters of the Vienna school, Franz Josef Haydnâ€™s 52nd sonata, Ludwig van Beethovenâ€™s Op. 2 no. 2 sonata and Wolfgang Mozartâ€™s earlier 9th sonata, K. 311.  Blechacz presents us an accomplished result but it is not a particularly exciting one, so isnâ€™t quite up to his Polonaises recording.The three sonatas are each on the drier side of the composerâ€™s efforts.  This dryness is underlined by Blechaczâ€™s performance approach, underemphasizing any sense of romanticism and even drama, in favor of a clear and objective presentation. The Haydn sonata which opens the disc (dating from 1794), one of his best known, is given a clear-eyed and utterly unsensual reading by Blechacz.  Iâ€™d never put this sonata among Haydnâ€™s more emotional pieces but it does have a sense of grandeur, but this interpretation is very neutral.The following selection, Beethovenâ€™s A-major sonata Op. 2/2 (1795) is among his most objective and purely classic efforts.  I thought this represented Blechaczâ€™s strongest effort here.  There is very little tonal variety in the pianism here and I found it welcome when Blechacz introduced a timbral effect in the thrice-repeated three repeated D#s in the conclusion of the Scherzos A section, setting off these higher notes by projecting another color.  The performance is lively and technically assured, as is all of the playing here.  The Mozart sonata is played well but hews to the same idea.DG has provided Blechacz with very average sound, not up to current standards.  Based on the Chopin Polonaises release, Blechacz is a gifted and often inspired pianist but that level of playing isnâ€™t found in this Haydn/Beethoven/Mozart disc, which is a solid but unmemorable effort.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAVU32ZPE9BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EO2UIG#wasThisHelpful","RQAVU32ZPE9BW","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this set of four JS Bach cantatas presented by Philippe Herreweghe and his musicians extremely beautiful and consistently excellent across all parameters: the cantatas themselves are terrific, the soloists are all very strong, and the choral and orchestral work is likewise excellent.  The performance is complemented by excellent sound engineering.All 4 cantatas date from the 1720s, with BWV 22 & 23 written in 1723 and BWV 127 and 159 later in the same decade.  Consistent with the cover of the suffering Christ, they are generally very serious in character although BWV 127 is in major and is more joyful.  All are unified by being intended for performance in the last Sunday prior to Lent, which provides a basis for their serious tone.The cantatas are simply ravishingly beautiful.  Iâ€™ll point to some of the highlights but I predict that you will find other tracks and passages that are just as striking.  The Aria â€œâ€Ich folgeâ€ from BWV 159 (track 16) for countertenor accompanied by chorus is striking, as is the succeeding Aria â€œEs is vollbrachtâ€ presented by star bass Peter Kooy (track 18), a grave and majestic aria.  Kooy is just excellent, perfect technically and singing with feeling. â€œEs is vollbrachtâ€ also features a major part for the solo oboe, performed Marcel Ponseele, who is highlighted often in this disc.  Ponseele and the other oboist, Taka Kitazako are also featured in one of my other highlights, the opening duet â€œDu wahrer Gottâ€ from BWV 23 (track 6), for a sort of concertante ensemble piece for the soprano, countertenor and oboes.  â€œDu wahrer Gottâ€ encapsulates this recording: serious in tone, each detail nailed, the technical aspect done perfectly.  The overall effect is wonderful.  Iâ€™m just pointing to these three movements, but there are others.  The opening chorale of BWV 127 is just wonderful (track 10), to point to another instance.Obviously, I love this disc.  The only criticism I can make is that Herreweghe, a conductor with a restrained style, doesnâ€™t try to accent the musicâ€™s passion.  The performance is highly musical throughout, but it is on the neutral and balanced side emotionally.  This is consistent with Herrewegheâ€™s style throughout his large catalog of recordings.  But for me the sheer beauty and consistent excellence of every part of the release made Herrewegheâ€™s restraint unimportant.  I think you will love this release.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31RZHN7FPLSHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L15C8W#wasThisHelpful","R31RZHN7FPLSHY","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This release represents a very good pick if you want just one collection of Anton Webernâ€™s music.  Pierre Boulez includes several of Webernâ€™s best compositions and the performances are very strong, with Boulez stepping outside of his comfort zone and delivering interpretations that fully express the angst and expressionism of terrific works like the Op. 5 movements (1909) and the Op. 1 Passacaglia (1908).Iâ€™ll point to the performance of another major Webern score, the Op. 6 pieces for orchestra (1910), as a highlight.  The hyperexpressive, fleeting moments of darkness and pain that permeate this set are brought out particularly well.  The uncharacteristically long â€“ at 4 minutes â€“ march written in response to the death of Webernâ€™s mother, has never in my experience sounded so urgent or meaningful.  It repeatedly led me to reimagine the shrouded terror and physical details of the funeral ceremony.  Boulez takes the piece quicker than other recordings I have, and the drama is put forth without any of the intellectualism that Boulez sometimes brings when he steps onto the podium.  The disc would be worth it just for the Op. 6 but I found the playing of the Op. 5 movements inspired.  Boulez also presents a very successful and dramatic version of the Passacaglia, a work I have always associated with hysteria and noir drama, almost like a musical evocation of Sigmund Freud.Boulez and the Berlin Philharmonic also present us with a nice performance of that early score, â€œIm sommerwindâ€, a 1904 effort done when Webern was just 21 and then controversially reconstructed by scholars after the authorâ€™s death. Whatever the musicological complaints about this reconstruction, I found it an interesting pre-modern score which shows Webern working interestingly in a chromatic but tonal idiom.The release has just one drawback â€“ a pallid, thin record engineering job - especially detrimental because of its impact on the miraculous transcription Webern made of JS Bachâ€™s Ricercar.  Done in 1935, the transcription is remarkable, bringing Bachâ€™s complex contrapuntal conception into the timbral arena, with the â€œpolyphony of notesâ€ extended into the â€œpolyphony of sound colorâ€, the strands of melody split up among different orchestral instruments to create a kaleidoscope of sound.  Boulez and the Berlin Philharmonix give us a strong interpretation.  The engineering drawbacks are particularly unfortunate because the same flaw afflicts the earlier and equally superb version of the Ricercar Boulez did around 1970 with the London Symphony.  So we have two versions of this hard piece led by maybe the leading conductor of modernist music, both performed exceptionally well by the musicians, and both ruined by subpar sound engineering.  Very unfortunate.But besides this flaw, and the irrelevant inclusion of some uninteresting transcriptions Webern did of Franz Schubert German Dances, this is really an exceptional recording, with terrific performances of the major original Webern orchestral pieces.  (Only the short Op. 10 pieces are left out.)  Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307RETM54MQIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GPO#wasThisHelpful","R307RETM54MQIQ","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Letâ€™s start by evaluating this CD without any mention of the pianistâ€™s biography.  An outstanding, consistent and technically highly accomplished 2013 recording of the 24 Frederic Chopin Etudes included in Opus 10 and 25, Jan Lisiecki takes a lyrical approach to the etudes, algned with Shura Cherkasskyâ€™s wonderful older recording.This lyrical approach is heard well in the 2 wonderful etudes which open Op. 25.  I havenâ€™t heard more taking, affecting versions of these two works.  Lisiecki doesnâ€™t slow them down too much and yet gently brings out their emotional component while preserving momentum.  The lyricism can also be heard in some of the more active pieces.  To take one impressive moment, Lisiecki slows down the portion towards the end of the famous opening Etude, Op. 10/1 where the bass shifts into fast even half-notes walking through the circle of fifths.  I know this Etude very well but have never heard that passage brought out to such great effect.Lisieckiâ€™s technique is also world class.  The â€œthree handsâ€ effects in Op. 10/10 are done with command and lucidity.  Lisiecki brings out of the central line in the complex texture so as to make it sound easy and clearly delineated in what I count are three different streams of accompaniment.  The passagework in the most famous track here, the â€œRevolutionaryâ€ Etude Op. 10/12 in c minor, is remarkable in its precision, the runs done effortlessly and perfectly.  This highly impressive technical ability is heard throughout the disc.  These pieces are hard to play, but you wouldnâ€™t know it from listening to Lisiecki.I compared Lisieckiâ€™s vision of the Etudes to Shura Cherkassky earlier.  As much as I love Cherkasskyâ€™s performance, at times he bogs down and loses the overarching sense of structure and momentum heard in Maurizio Polliniâ€™s brilliant recording.  Cherkassky at times seems to meander off the path; Lisieckiâ€™s similar interpretation never loses its sense of forward motipon.  The structure is palpable and it never drags.So here I am comparing Lisieckiâ€™s Etudes favorably to one of the master performances from the 20th century.  A few minutes ago I looked Lisieckiâ€™s bio up and was absolutely gobsmacked to find that he was born in 1995 and was 18 (!)â€¦ ok, one more exclamation point â€¦ (!) when he set down this interpretation.  Listening to the recording, I was under the impression Lisiecki was an emerging pianist, maybe in his early 30s, impressive enough on the basis of such a coherent and individual approach to the Etudes. That this performance could come from a teenager is scarcely believable.  This has to be among the top handful of performances ever to come from a teenage pianist.But Lisieckiâ€™s age is besides the point, given the quality, originality and technical mastery displayed in this Etudes.  The only complaint I have is the slightly fuzzy and mediocre sound engineering from DG.  I have several Etudes recordings in my collection, and they are a strong group overall.  Lisieckiâ€™s is up there with the best of them.  Amazing and strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NY95UAUUPR6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCCE3VM#wasThisHelpful","R3NY95UAUUPR6I","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three versions of Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s 1643 historical opera â€œThe Coronation of Poppeaâ€.  One is an outstanding and austere version of â€œPoppeaâ€ reissued by Brilliant Classics, a live performance done in Corsica in 2004 and conducted by Sergio Vartolo.  The Vartolo performance is purer, lasts about 4 hours and makes no concessions to personal schedule, luxuriating in the beauty of early baroque monody.  Because of its lack of concessions, I recommend the Vartolo to convinced early music fans â€“ itâ€™s a remarkable recording.  Vartolo and his musicians also take things very slowly; the tempi taken in the version headlined by soprano Arleen Auger in the title role and conducted by Richard Hickox (Virgin Classics) is generally snappier and swifter.  The Auger is overall an easier version to digest, and features some outstanding solo singing from both Auger and others.  Generally very beautiful, I recommend it for more general listeners or those just getting to know â€œPoppeaâ€.  Both the Auger and Vartolo are significantly better than Nikolas Harnoncourtâ€™s earlier recording, under review here.The issue with the Harnoncourt is some shaky solo singing, with problems occurring throughout the opera.  Act II of â€œPoppeaâ€ is the heart of this wonderful opera, featuring the suicide of Seneca, Neroâ€™s tutor.  This suicide â€“ with Seneca presenting his noble sense of duty â€“ is emblematic of the operaâ€™s big theme, the decline of the Roman empire into moral decay.  The ensuing scenes, including some beautiful â€œcourtâ€ ariettas and duets, are capped by the long set of scenes involving the courtier Ottoneâ€™s attempted assassination attempt on Poppea.  This stretch of music, key to the dramaâ€™s success, are lacking in vocal precision, making for some downright unattractive moments and quite a few other numbers which are mediocre, but could be better.  In the scenes showing Senecaâ€™s last moments on earth, the opening scene of Act II done by Giancarlo Luccardi (as Seneca) and Enrico Fissore (Mercurio) is slipshod, with erratic pitch.  Or the very taking and beautiful court scene between an amorous page and â€œdamigellaâ€ is not helped by somewhat sloppy singing (Act II, scene 4).  Famed soprano Elizabeth Soderstrom takes the â€œpants roleâ€ of Nero; I found her very shaky in this role, with pitch issues, and a feeling she was struggling with some of the passages.  The next scene (5 in Act II) has an exchanged between Nero and Lucano (done by Philip Langridge) that is all over the place, passage work slipshod enough to really detracted from enjoyment.Iâ€™m selecting from many examples of subpar singing:  Helen Donath takes the title role as Poppea and she is pretty good, but she strains in some of the higher passages, as in the final love duet in Act III (scene 5).  Another famous singer, Cathey Berberian, takes an important supporting role as Ottavia, and while she does well in the upper ranges, she struggles with the lower passages (again in Act III, scene 6).  Paul Esswood takes another key supporting role as Ottone, the lovelorn and wannabe-assassin, and he exhibits that lack of fluency and deft technique I associate with an earlier generation of countertenors. The countertenors who take on this role in the Auger and Vartolo versions I mention above are far better, and make the most of what is a great role.  Generally, the first Act shows the singers doing ok, but the quality level drops with Acts 2 and 3 marred by so many issues with the soloists that I am wondering whether a lack of rehearsal time prevented the performance of this very long and complex opera from coming together.  Whatever the cause, I heard problems throughout.Iâ€™m assigning this Harnoncourt release 3 stars.  The audio engineering is actually very good.  Overall, this isnâ€™t a terrible release, but itâ€™s fair to say that itâ€™s been superseded since its release in 1974.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NA5DL7GLRMTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008F0F7#wasThisHelpful","R3NA5DL7GLRMTO","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Any 3-disc release presenting complex music like Anton Webernâ€™s with many different performers contributing is bound not to be perfect in every respect.  But I have been listening and comparing this Sony collection with alternative Webern performances recently and found it stands up very well, with several performances being downright brilliant and many others falling in the good to very successful range.  I have no hesitation in rating the set 5 stars and, if you are interested in Webernâ€™s fascinating music, recommend it.Highlights include the performance of the 4 Orchestral Songs, Op. 13 from 1918.  Heather Harper sings the lead vocals with passion and a strong sense of the expressionist feeling, with Pierre Boulez and ensemble providing effective accompaniment.  I compared Harperâ€™s version with the more recent and very fine Boulez recording done with Francoise Pollet (on DG) and found Harper on a higher plane of performance, more naturally expressive, communicating the musicâ€™s feeling.  Itâ€™s impressive when you compare two performances and find one excellent and the alternative inspired in comparison.Turning to Webernâ€™s abstruse later twelve-tone work, the two Cantatas, finished in 1939 and 1943, are done very well.  This is extremely difficult music to perform so you have to credit Boulez and soprano Halina Lukomska for both the technical execution and the musicality they bring to these cantatas.  I also need to single out baritone Barry McDanielâ€™s performance in the longer 2nd Cantata â€“ long within Webernâ€™s world of fragments and miniatures â€“ which struck me as exceptional.  The performances of the Op. 21 Symphony (1928) and the freely atonal 6 Piece for orchestra Op. 6 (1910) by Boulez and the London Symphony are worthy and stood up well in relation to alternatives.  Finally, Iâ€™ll also point to a sensitive performance of the Piano Variations (1936) from Charles Rosen.  The Variations are certainly not my favorite music but Rosen presents them in the best possible light.There are less successful portions here as well.  I found the Juilliard Quartetâ€™s performances of works like the Op. 5 Movements (1909) and Op. 9 Bagatelles (1913) to be inferior to alternatives I have, due to some clumsiness in the technique and a relatively unpolished sound by todayâ€™s standards.  The Op. 7 piano and violin pieces (1910) featuring Isaac Stern and Rosen are also mediocre in my opinion.The sound engineering is mostly pretty good â€“ the recordings took place across a half decade in a variety of locations â€“ but there is one notable fail.  Webernâ€™s orchestral transcription of JS Bachâ€™s Ricercar from the Musical Offering, done in 1935, is a remarkable achievement, extending Bachâ€™s complex contrapuntal music into the timbral area, with the â€œpolyphony of notesâ€ extended into the â€œpolyphony of sound colorâ€, the strands of melody split up among different orchestral instruments to create a kaleidoscope of sound.  Boulez and the London Symphony give us a very strong interpretation, accurate and musical, of this fiendishly difficult piece but the sound on this release is washed out, a key negative in a transcription dependent on sound color.  That engineering fail detracts from the actual performance in an important way.The set includes a very thorough booklet.  It does not include that orchestral reconstruction of â€œIm sommerwindâ€, a youthful post-romantic work from 1904 which was reconstructed by scholars subsequent to the original release, or a number of youthful works Webern completed in his early 20s.

"Franz Josef Haydnâ€™s transition from the rococo style â€“ relatively unstructured, florid, with more fluid forms â€“ to the high classical style â€“ the long-term structure developed â€“ took place in the late 1760s and early 1770s.  Both sonatas selected by Ivo Pogorelich in this 1992 recording come from before the transition period.  My first reaction to this recording was that it didnâ€™t sound like the Haydn I know and love, but as I looked into the dates of the two sonatas, with the 19th dating from 1767 and the 46th finished in 1770, it came home that the music had more in common with Domenico Scarlattiâ€™s mid-century rococo sonatas than Haydnâ€™s later music.  So this release is in a way an extension of Pogorelichâ€™s fine Scarlatti disc.Pogorelichâ€™s performance is both effective and a bit weird.  The style of the 19th and 46th sonatas allows him to show off his sensitivity of touch, clean yet colorful passagework and beautiful sound.  Pogorelich is keen on making the most of the timbral effects, which he plays gorgeously, taking the emphasis off the harmony and meter.  But it is also a bit weird.  Pogorelich plays the sonatas very slowly â€“ I mean very slowly.  Beyond the tempo selection, the meter is further bent out of shape by his occasionally slowing down.  This happens repeatedly throughout the disc.  To take one case, in the exposition of the 19thâ€™s opening Moderato, the 3rd measure contains an interruption of the opening dotted rhythm strain and Pogorelich inserts a pause, stopping the momentum.  The same sort of pause is made at the end of the 11th measure.  The sounds are very nice but they are isolated, with the pace, momentum and metric structure of Haydnâ€™s later style absent.While I partly attribute this lack of cohesion â€“ much of both sonatas sound like a series of pretty yet disconnected phrases â€“ to Ivo, I think this basically transmits what Haydn wrote faithfully.  When Haydn takes a more traditional approach, Pogorelich really shines.  The best individual track in my opinion is the last one, the finale of the 19th sonata, still done slower than one would expect from the Allegro assai, but not that much more slowly.  Pogorelichâ€™s precious and exquisite passagework provides very attractive color to set off the contrasting phrases here; yet the sense of structure sounded clear to me.  This finale is built out of short 8 measure phrases, each set off and marked with double bars, so it is a more organized than the other five movements.  Within this music, weird Ivo becomes much more normal, like a wild child tempered by a regimented school day.Pogorelich is helped by a superior audio engineering job from DG.  This is a strong disc, often beautifully done, but be aware it is of atypical Haydn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8I1YK42WYXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GGB#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8I1YK42WYXA","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1995 release led by Pierre Boulez is a well-executed compendium that traces the Austrian composer Anton von Webernâ€™s evolution from a young, developing composer writing in a late romantic style through the free atonal works circa 1910 and then on to the vocal works which he wrote as he adopted the twelve-tone method conceived by his mentor, Arnold Schoenberg.  In this way, it serves as a very good overview of Webernâ€™s work as a whole.  As youâ€™d expect from Boulez, the performances are perfectionist and accomplished, the most prominent being what I think is an outstanding and downright powerful interpretation of the Op. 10 Orchestra Pieces (1913), which is also probably the best single opus in this collection.The disc opens with a 1907 Piano Quintet written in a chromatic late romantic style.  While accomplished and clearly revealing Webernâ€™s ability at the age of 24, it isnâ€™t memorable.  Webern quickly developed in the next 5 years, producing major mature works within a couple of years of writing the Quintet.  Boulez next programs a choral piece named â€œEntflieht auf leichten KÃ¤hnenâ€ for a capella choir which is well done by the BBC Singers, followed by the Op. 10 orchestra pieces, written in the compact, freely atonal and expressionist style that Webern adopted in this part of his life.  Then â€“ and this is the center of the disc â€“ sopranos Francoise Pollet and Christine Oelze and the BBC Singers presents a series of vocal works written from 1914 and 1926 where Webern transitioned into the twelve-tone style.  The highpoint of this portion for me were the 4 Orchestral Songs Op. 13 (1918), which are sung very well by Pollet.  I compared this newer Pollet interpretation, where she is accompanied by the Ensemble InterContemperain led by Boulez, with the older Boulez version on Sony headlined by soprano Heather Harper and found that older version to be a special one, marked by the sort of heightened awareness and sensitivity to each event I associate with Webern music and performances in peak form.  Still Pollet and the Ensemble do well, as does the talented Oehlze in her numbers.  These vocal works are capped by two compact instrumental works, each about 6 minutes long, the 1930 Quartet for saxophone and other instruments and the 1934 Concerto for nine instruments, both done in the fully-developed twelve-tone style Webern, characteristic of him in the 1930s.So why do I rate this worthy and well performed disc at only 4 stars?  I found the music selected to be of uneven quality and interest.  I have been reading for decades in various music history books that Webernâ€™s adoption of the twelve-tone style represents a very natural evolution of his personal style; with the twelve-tone method adapted to his own ends.  While this is certainly an accurate appraisal as far as it goes, this disc brought home to me the fact that something very important was lost as Webern discarded the free atonal style of works like the Op. 10 orchestral pieces.  The twelve-tone pieces lose the emotional power and sense of grasping towards the ineffable that these free atonal pieces intimate.  The twelve-tone works, like the Saxophone Quartet or the 6 Georg Trakl Songs (op. 14, from 1921), seemed hemmed in, preoccupied with technique rather than expression and meaning, too cerebral.  The magic disappears.My reaction was this generously-filled disc starts with so-so developmental works like the Quartet and â€˜Entfliehtâ€™, hits a high point with the Op, 10 orchestral pieces and the Op. 13 orchestral songs, than grows less and less interesting as it goes on.  The quality of much of the music is light, in other words.  If you are interested in these exact works, Boulez and the other musicians do an excellent performing job, making this a good choice.  The audio engineering from DG is acceptable although no better than that.  I found the two other Boulez discs in the Webern trilogy he set down for DG to contain Webernâ€™s better music with this one a mixed bag.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7J96E8R432C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GIU#wasThisHelpful","R3K7J96E8R432C","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would characterize Mstislav Rostropovichâ€™s conducting as sensitive to timbral nuances, highly musical and relaxed rather than passionate, and often very successful in sustaining long paragraphs of music in a coherent way.  Iâ€™ve heard these things in the very worthwhile interpretations of Dmitri Shostakovichâ€™s 4th and 10th symphonies that Rostropovich set down with the London Symphony and was curious to see how he would approach the authorâ€™s most famous symphony, the 5th, here leading the National Symphony, from Washington DC.  The results are good but not really exceptional.This performance is musical, reasonably emotional and technically executed well, but it isnâ€™t outstanding in any of these individual parameters, in my view.  One thing I was expecting based on my very positive experiences with Rostropovichâ€™s conducting across the Russian repertory was a very finely done Largo, all the subtleties of this complex and stunning slow movement presented with care and a balanced musicality.  Instead, itâ€™s a successful but not memorable performance. The memorable high string melody in the long opening Moderato is done with finesse, but I couldnâ€™t help comparing it to the well-known recent version Vasily Petrenko did his Liverpool orchestra on Naxos, which holds an exquisite Largo, spooky and rich, and a whisper-soft Moderato main theme.  And while the more assertive, powerful sections are done well, they are without a sense of overriding dramatic power.The spooky interlude 5 minutes into the Largo (track 3) illustrates this performanceâ€™s general character.  This is that almost spooky passage where the music settles down into the gloom with the flutes presenting a sad melody in the middle of their register.  Rostropovich and the National Symphony play the music in a perfectly fine way, but it has neither a special intensity that the section can hold or particularly finesse in working out the delicate orchestration.  This encapsulates this performance.So this is a bit of middle of the road performance.  It is a good one but not outstanding in what is a crowded field.  The partnership of Rostropovich with Teldec, a label with a history of very strong audio engineering, would seem to be ideal given Mstislavâ€™s interpretative style, but the sonics in this release, while good, are not especially striking either.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E2TT6A0MRY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVZABA#wasThisHelpful","R25E2TT6A0MRY1","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because it combines strong work from the solo singers, a very capable instrumental group, good sound and cuts down this lengthy opera down to about 3 hours, I recommend this very beautiful version of Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s 1643 opera â€œThe Coronation of Poppeaâ€ to all listeners who arenâ€™t familiar with the work.  I have two other versions.  One is an outstanding and more austere version of â€œPoppeaâ€ reissued by Brilliant Classics, a live performance done in Corsica in 2004 and conducted by Sergio Vartolo.  This Vartolo performance is purer, lasts about 4 hours and makes no concessions to personal schedule, luxuriating in the beauty of early baroque monody.  Because of its lack of concessions, I recommend the Vartolo to convinced early music fans â€“ itâ€™s a remarkable recording.  Vartolo and his musicians also take things very slowly; the tempi taken in the Arleen Auger version being reviewed here are snappier and swifter.  The Auger is overall an easier version to digest.  Both it and Vartoloâ€™s are significantly better than Nikolas Harnoncourtâ€™s earlier recording, which is held back by uneven singing.This recording is headlined by soprano Arleen Auger, a wonderful singer at the peak of her powers.  Auger plays Poppea, the homewrecking seductress whoâ€™s ambition and luring away of the Emperer Nero is used to symbolize the moral decline of the Roman Empire, the potent theme of this ambitious historical opera.  It is traditional today to cast Nero as a soprano in a â€œpants roleâ€, filling in for the castrati who did the part in the 17th century.  In this version, British mezzo-soprano Della Jones is Nero and she is consistently good, doing her best work I think in the concluding marriage sequence in Act III.  The duet that initiates the marriage scene, â€œAscendiâ€, features some especially good stuff from Jones.  The supporting cast is quite strong although not perfect.  Gregory Reinhart is assigned to the crucial supporting part of Seneca, Neroâ€™s tutor.  Reinhart has a bass voice on the lighter side of things but does well, singing with precision and feeling in the 2nd Act, which to me is the heart of the opera.  The choral sections marking Senecaâ€™s suicide are well done, with effective part singing that throws us back to the madrigals Monteverdi wrote in the earlier part of his career, several decades before the aging composer set down â€œPoppea.â€  The sensual and attractive â€œSentoâ€ duet in Act II (scene 5, track 7 of the 2nd disc here) receives an adept presentation and the supporting work is generally strong.  I also enjoyed the playing of Richard Hickox and the City of London Baroque Sinfonia, who give us an instrumental accompaniment that is beautiful without being obtrusive.The performance isnâ€™t perfect -- although none of it is bad. Besides Seneca, one of the other key supporting roles is Ottone, the enamored courtier tied in knots by love and honor. James Bowman is the countertenor who takes this part.  While he is OK, he suffers in comparison to the brilliant Ottone, William Mateuzzi, who does so well in the Vartolo version I mentioned above.But for such an ambitious staging, weaknesses as neutral as this are to be expected and donâ€™t overall mar a very strong release of what is an intriguing and frequently awesome drama.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXU50ZC7PIAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008FZPD#wasThisHelpful","RXXU50ZC7PIAP","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This recording from 1999 presents Finnish mezzo Monica Groop in three JS Bach canatatas for solo alto, numbers 35, 169 and 170, all of which were written within a few months of each other in 1726.  Groop has a lustrous dark mezzo that is often quite beautiful but she is also not a particularly expressive singer.  The accompaniment provided by the Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestra led by director Juha Kangas, also from Finland, is just as important in setting the performance tone as Groop but the same tendency is present in the instruments.  Kangas has a tendency to flatten out all tempi to a moderate pace - fast and slow sections are blended - which unfortunately accentuates Groop's lack of emotional dynamism.  The organ obligato part provided by Hakan Wikman is also more important in these cantatas than in other Bach works in the genreand seems to be done well.The lack of dynamics and tempo variation -- and ultimately emotional range â€“ is very clear in the performance of the beautiful Cantata 169 (â€œGott soll alleinâ€).  To take an example, in the recitative â€œWas ist die Liebe Gottesâ€ and the following tragic aria, â€œStirb in Mirâ€, Bachâ€™s mood of tragic sobriety isn't matched by a rather monotone solo vocal interpretation.  In Cantata 170 (â€œVergnugte Ruheâ€), one of the most striking numbers is the almost mystical â€œWie jammernâ€ aria, with a featured organ obligato part but without continuo, apparently a symbol representing those who lead a God-less life.  I feel this aria has much more potential than in this performance, which takes it at a moderate pace restricting its impact.  The best part of the release I think is the opening Sinfonia to cantata 169, which I thought Kangas and the Ostrobothnian orchestra do pretty well.I hope Iâ€™m not coming off as excessively critical.  This is technically well-executed recording.  Groop has the chops and she has a very nice voice.  The orchestra is technically able if not dazzling.  The recorded sound is actually very good, as youâ€™d expect from the Finlandia label.  But itâ€™s not an inspiring recording and doesnâ€™t do justice to three Bach works from his prime.

"Nikolai Lugansky, aged 27 when this recording was made in 1999, gives us a promising and generally pretty good set of Fredric Chopinâ€™s magnificent Etudes, including the Op. 10 and 25 sets as well as the three Nouvelles Etudes written later on in 1839.  Lugansky is a somewhat emotionally restrained performer but he is a musical one.  Technically, he is strong without being outstanding, at least among the current field of pianists, many of whom are dazzling in this area.Some of Luganskiâ€™s best playing comes in the two first etudes of the Op. 25 set.  In the â€œAeolian Harpâ€ op. 25/1 etude, he shows real feeling in presenting the luxuriant melody.  The turning triplets that make up the foundation of the Op. 25/2 are done with delicacy and a sense of rhythmic nuance that is wonderful.  I enjoyed Luganskiâ€™s playing of the three nouvelles etudes and think it is one of the better portions of this release.  In the amazing first etude, Luganski very affectingly presents the main melodyâ€™s cresting to the high C-flat  that marks this compact pieceâ€™s highest point in the register.  In the Op. 10 set, the main section of Etude 9 possesses a well-presented forward momentum with the transition into the brooding contrasting sections paced perfectly.But quite a few of the etudes donâ€™t have the emotional power I have heard in alternative performances.  Op. 25/4 is played by the numbers with the sense of tragic momentum I hear in this Ã©tude absent.  The Op. 10/2 etude lacks the Ã©lan and sense of momentum it can bring.  I also found Luganskiâ€™s version of the big 25/7 Ã©tude pedestrian; Luganski has a leaden unengaged feel in this etude, a centerpiece of the set.  The desolate Op. 10/6 etude is presented nicely but the poetic conclusion can be more emotional and overwrought than Luganskiâ€™s staid conception shows.I made a comment about Luganskiâ€™s technique earlier.  He is a strong pianist but not a perfect one, at least here in this Chopin. For example, both Op. 10/4 and 10/5 etudes shows a lack of tightness between the faster passagework and the accompanying chords.  In Op. 10/4, the passagework and chords are presented in alternation in the right and left hands; in Op. 10/5, the chords are restricted to the left hand.  Now anyone who can play these etudes professionally is a very good technician â€“ they are hard â€“ but the issue is that stronger technical alternatives exist (see Maurizio Polliniâ€™s famous set).  Recorded sound is very good.You get the idea of my reaction.  This is a promising and accomplished recording from a young pianist who has no doubt developed greatly since setting down these sessions.  Itâ€™s good and enjoyable but lacks emotional impact in etudes scattered throughout the disc, so it varies between the good and the very good.  I recommend alternatives such as the Pollini I mention above and the older and very different recording from Shura Cherkassky.

"This exquisitely beautiful version of Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s â€œThe Coronation of Poppeaâ€ (1643) is for purists.  A fair bit longer than other versions of the opera I have, it emphasizes the beauty of the declamatory monody which makes up most of â€œPoppeaâ€, with the sung and instrumental portions appearing as breaks within the action, rather than the opposite.  I generally found the reviews here on Amazon donâ€™t do justice to just how excellent and ravishing this recording is.  It comes from an obscure source, a 2004 performance in Corsica, so we can thank a perceptive A&R person at Brilliant for hearing its quality and reissuing it.  The recording seems to have been done on a tight budget, with many of the singers serving in multiple roles; despite these constraints, the sound engineering is audiophile quality.  Itâ€™s certainly one of the best sounding opera releases in my collection.The cast is on the whole very good.  Patrizia Biccire does well as the conniving Poppea.  I very enjoyed Raffaele Costantiniâ€™s work as Seneca, one of the most rewarding of the parts, and Gabriella Martellaci gives us a successful Arnalta.  The weakest solo singing I thought came from Liliani Rugiero, who does the â€œpantsâ€ role of Nero in Acts I and III (surprisingly, a different singer does Nero in Act II).  Apparently, castrati singers handled the part of Nero in the 17th century, so the common adaptation for modern stagings is to give this part to sopranos.  But Rugiero isnâ€™t bad, so itâ€™s a pretty high floor for a cast recording.But the real stand-out for me was countertenor William Mateuzzi in the role of Ottone, a surprise for me as Iâ€™m not usually taken with this vocal type.  He truly shines in several luxuriant numbers towards the end of Act II, including the solo raging number in Scene 7 and the foiled assassination attempt on Poppea presented in Scene 13, foiled because the god of love appears to defend the immoral but amorous target.  The 2nd Act is for me the heart and the best part of â€œPoppeaâ€.  Besides the latter sequence, concluding with the assassination attempt, the suicide of Seneca, symbolizing the death of Roman republican virtues and the growing decadence of the empire, is very attractive music.  The performance here is excellent and Costantini is both expressive and sonically rich, with a wonderful bass voice.  The austere tragedy of the suicide gives way to a contrasting supporting scene, in which a page and lady-in-waiting from the Roman court engage in a duet celebrating their very physical love.  Itâ€™s a measure of the quality of this performance that even such a scene, with two supporting singers, is highly attractive and executed with such panache.For general listeners, I would generally recommend the â€œPoppeaâ€ released by Virgin with Arleen Auger in the title role.  It is a more colorful and condensed rendition.  But this version, led by Sergio Vartolo from the harpsichord, will greatly please early music or baroque opera fans.  The release contains the text in both Italian and English along with informative notes.  It sounds great, the singing ranges from the good to the exceptional, and the art of Monteverdi is presented in a pure, unapologetic way.

"Anton Webernâ€™s mini-miniatures arenâ€™t just short, they are condensed, with each phrase often taking the place of an entire section in other, more normal music.  In such a telescoped environment, the details and intensity of focus on each individual note is all-important.  Though outside their normal repertory, the Quartetto Italiano seem to understand the importance of detail.  The final moments of the 4th of the 5 Movements Op. 5 (1909) illustrates their success.  This fourth piece, a one-page fragment, ends with a rising phrase in the viola, followed by a slow-moving pianissimo passage constructed from harmonics ending with a lower pizzicato, and capped by an echo of the violaâ€™s brief line, this time higher up in the 2nd violin part.  In this performance, the different timbral effects are precise and I had a palpable feeling that time had slowed down; the Quartetto makes each note count.The famous 6 Bagatelles (Op. 9, from 1913) are even briefer than the dense Op. 5.  The Quartetto brings admirable attention to the sound color changes, which Webern creates using many special string special effects, and rhythmic placement.  The 5th bagatelle, whisper soft, is a series of allusive dynamic surges, but not surges from piano to forte, rather, surges from triple piano to double piano, often done over a single note.  In such a context, the pizzicato F in the 1st violin arriving mid-way through the piece is a major event.  Played here, this beautiful Bagatelle, clocking in at well under a minute, has the same Zen-like attention to each detail in the hands of the Quartetto that I heard in the Op. 5 movements.This is a beautiful performance.  I hadnâ€™t taken it off the shelf in well over a decade but listened to it recently and, unsure what to expect, was taken with the result.  The Quartetto live up to their reputation as one of the best quartets ever and have given us a precious and utterly successful disc that I warmly recommend.  The performers are helped by outstanding analog engineering from Philips.  This engineering is a significant contributor to the releaseâ€™s success as it allows the spacing of the instruments to come through, something which creates a special presence and helps the timbral effects so important to Webernâ€™s atonal music to come through.I compared several of the pieces presented by the Quartetto Italiano to the recordings by the Juilliard Quartet on the Sony complete Webern set.  The Juilliard versions are pretty good, but they donâ€™t have that focus and sense of intense attention to the moment found in the Italiano version.  The Juilliard plays the music; the Italiano seems to live, not just play, each note and gesture.The disc is not a long one.  It is filled up by a formative post-Brahmsian Langsamer Satz (1905) which Webern wrote when he was 22.  Then â€“ and this is really remarkable â€“ from the same year, we have a String Quartet close to 20 minutes in length very different from the Langsamer Satz.  It is still tonal, but written in an adventurous chromatic language that I would compare to Franz Schreker.  Then we jump four years into 1909, the Op. 5 set and a completely different world, of compact, allusive atonality.  The speed of Webernâ€™s development is astounding.  Also included is the late twelve-tone String Quartet, a very abstract, almost inscrutable work from 1936, commissioned by an American patron.  So the disc doesnâ€™t give us a wonderful interpretation but presents to us Webernâ€™s voyage from immaturity to adult achievement.  If you are a fan of Webernâ€™s abstruse art, you will want to hear this recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9CLEI085OAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E3LM#wasThisHelpful","R2P9CLEI085OAX","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coming back to it after several years Iâ€™ll shy away from such hyperbole - the greyness and moderation of age interferes -- but Maurizio Polliniâ€™s achievement in this justly celebrated performance remains inspiring.  It isnâ€™t a perfect recording, but it has many tracks which are incredible.Polliniâ€™s interpretation is characterized by both his awesome technical ability and a relatively strict meter and sense of beat, with less tempo flexibility than many other pianists in these etudes.  It isnâ€™t fair to view Polliniâ€™s stricter metric approach as machine-like; he applies great sensitivity to some of the Etudes.  The wonderful Op. 10/4 Etude receives an emphatically dramatic treatment from Pollini.  In the dark and brooding Op. 10/6 Etude, Pollini builds towards the sigh that is the concluding theme in a way that doesnâ€™t show a detached or emotionless interpreter.  That said, the objectivity Pollini brings has its less successful moments, notably in the long and lyrical Op. 25/7, a wonderful composition which I think can use more sensitivity.But a freer, less rigid frame for the Etudes has its downsides as well.  One of my favorite alternative recordings of this set comes from Shura Cherkassky (included in the Philips Great Pianists series).  Cherkassky brings a wonderful freedom and sensitivity, especially successful in some of the slower Etudes.  But this freedom and lyricism also lessens the impact of Chopinâ€™s contrasts and makes both the Op. 10 and 25 sets more homogenous and unstructured. Great interpretations shape the music in a strong way and this shaping both produces insight and a downside.  Pollini creates momentum, drama combined with utter technical command, but at a cost of sometimes underplaying the emotion and lyricism in the Etudes.I havenâ€™t mentioned Polliniâ€™s performance of the final 3 etudes of the Op. 25 set, number 10, 11 and 12.  Now whatever criticism can be made of Pollini, when you have performances of this caliber anywhere in any release, it marks it as a success.  Polliniâ€™s passagework is incredible.  The ff octaves in Op. 25/10 are frighteningly intense.  His fiery performance of the â€œWinter Windâ€ (no. 11) is sweeping and gripping.  The tragedy and grandeur of the final etude, 0p. 25/12, is revealed in a way I havenâ€™t heard from any other performer.  I donâ€™t believe this sense of climactic ending would exist without Polliniâ€™s strict frame and his careful treatment of textures and tempo contrasts.  Itâ€™s a memorable and intense conclusion to this great release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UCZ5IDY2IUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001G5H#wasThisHelpful","R32UCZ5IDY2IUX","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 3-star rating applies only to the sound quality of the new â€œOriginalsâ€ release of Maurizio Polliniâ€™s celebrated performance of the Chopin Etudes.  Polliniâ€™s Etudes remains a justly famous and pre-eminent interpretation of this wonderful music and one of this famous pianistâ€™s signature achievements.  This remastering unfortunately doesnâ€™t do anything to elevate the experience.I am baffled by how Deutsche Grammophon could let this pass release through any sort of reasonable quality control process.  The original CD release has richer sound with a more impactful bass.  The remaster has a thinner and less rich sound, with more distortion in treble.  Some harshness is present in both the original CD release and this Originals remastering pointing to weak origjnal engineering â€“ so we arenâ€™t dealing with a perfect original recording from an engineering standpoint -- but the remastering doesn't improve matters.  The more lyrical Op. 10 no. 10 Etude has a broader and more flowing texture than many of the other more technically-focussed etudes; the remaster does nothing to make Polliniâ€™s sound richer or more true to the sound of the instrument.Youâ€™ll have to excuse me for something of a rant here.  Iâ€™ve recently been listening to a digital recording of a baroque opera produced in an obviously resource-constrained setting at a provincial opera house in Corsica at about the time this remaster was released.  Yet the engineers generated a recording with audiophile-level sound.  In contrast, the producers of this Original remaster worked for one of the premier classical labels with much more expertise and money available, and they produce an inferior product like this reissue. And once they produce it, they donâ€™t examine it self-critically and decide that it needs to be redone because [underline] it doesnâ€™t sound as good as the original unremastered CD release [end underline] no, they release it.Great pianism.

"Herbert von Karajan.  Pierre Boulez.  Two great conductors, one steeped in the music of romanticism; the other a prominent modernist, both as a conductor and as a composer.Based on their background, youâ€™d think Boulez would be clearly superior in presenting the music of arch-modernist Anton von Webern, yet I don't find that to be the case.  Coming back after a few years to Herbert von Karajanâ€™s short release of four Webern orchestral pieces done with the Berlin Philharmonic, I was at first taken aback by how much I liked the performances.  Karajan shouldnâ€™t be good at this repertory, right?  But what I was hearing was incisive music-making that showed genuine understanding of Webern and presented him in a new light.Listening to the Karajan was not just enjoyable, but also thought-provoking.  Emphasized overwhelmingly in the writings about Webern and the New Viennese School is their move towards atonality, placing the changing treatment of pitch and harmony at center stage.  But coming from a more practical and traditional world of classical performing, Karajan to my ears highlights two other aspects of Webernâ€™s art which, once you consider them, are just as important to the composerâ€™s artistry as the pitch/harmony angle.One is the barely suppressed subcurrent of emotional hysteria.  This is readily apparent in the longest of the Op. 6 pieces for orchestra (1910), the fourth, an acknowledged funeral march written when Webernâ€™s mother passed away.  It is also at the forefront in the Passacaglia (1908), marked as Op. 1 in certainly one of the best debut works in the classical repertory, a tonal work about 8 minutes in length.  Karajanâ€™s performance is brilliant.  It is a melodramatic and always gripping version, stinting at nothing.  It evokes a recurrent image of a careening car from a 1930s black & white movie about crime and madness; this is â€œnoirâ€ music before the genre was created.  None of this is surprising or novel â€“ after all, Expressionism was the most prominent artistic movement in the Vienna of this time -- but I think itâ€™s fair to say that many Webern performances de-emphasize it, including the performances from Boulez.Then there is the concision.  Nothing new here, again, but Karajanâ€™s dramatic and forceful performances emphasize it.  His version of the 3rd of the Op. 5 pieces, a later orchestral transcription of a set originally written for string quartet (1909), exemplifies this.  It is as if a lengthy violin concerto has been distilled into gestures, each condensed into a few seconds and not repeated.  The accompaniment begins with a tense pattern, repeated just a few times, then the soloist comes in, with the just the opening gesture presented â€“ and the rest of the concerto follows, taking up just two minutes.  Karajanâ€™s sense of drama highlights the charged nature of each note.  Expressionist hysteria and Webernâ€™s telescoping to time into brief moments â€“ â€œa novel in a single gestureâ€ -- are common associations in the artistâ€™s music, but I found Karajan stressed those ideas with particular success.The odd Symphony Op. 21 (1928) is different from the three earlier works included here in terms of emotional temperature, the twelve-tone technique used to create a more neutral and objective palette.  Karajanâ€™s performance is charismatic and forthright.  The way he brings out the long held notes in the first movement, emerging from the kaleidoscope of pitches in the rest of the texture, grabs me each time I hear it.  To return to the Boulez comparison, the French conductor is superb, but his interpretations donâ€™t seem as incisive as Karajanâ€™s.  Thereâ€™s something a bit fussy and inhibited. In particular, I found Boulezâ€™s Symphony a pale shadow of Karajanâ€™s robust vision.  (I listened to both Boulez earlier London Symphony version and his later one done, like Karajan, with the Berlin Philharmonic.)  I found the same to occur in the Op. 5 Movements, where Karajan seemed to penetrate deeper than a perfectionist but somewhat sterile Boulez performance.  Itâ€™s as if Boulez had read too much about Webern and had attended too many seminars analyzing the pitch language of the New Viennese School.  Something has been lost.The only complaint I will make about the Karajan disc is the mediocre sound, a common problem with his recordings from around 1970.  But this is a perceptive interpretation that engages with Webernâ€™s art in a sympathetic and profound way.  It may come from an unusual source, but remains very worthwhile.  Recommended for fans of 20th-century music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28CXZHST5GQAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E3Z6#wasThisHelpful","R28CXZHST5GQAZ","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Straight from Poland, Rafal Blechaczâ€™s set of 7 Chopin Polonaises is an exciting, alive recording, the performerâ€™s tremendous technique married to a sense of drama and a palpable enjoyment in presentign this repertory.  I consider it the best of three sets of Polonaises I have heard, more exciting and cleaner technically than the excellent one from Arthur Rubinstein, who takes a more relaxed and low-key approach, and the less satisfactory one from Maurizio Pollini, which has nowhere near the passion Blechacz brings to the music, despite the Italianâ€™s undoubted technical excellence.  The Blechacz recording also benefits from first-rate sound.One of my â€œguilty pleasuresâ€ is the â€œSerbianâ€ Polonaise (track 2 here, Op. 26 no. 2 from 1836), with its heady melody and dramatic exposition.  I loved the way Blechacz builds up from the somber opening, exploding into the 2-octave run that leads into this melody.  This Polonaise is just terrific throughout and brims with excitement.Another reviewer had pointed to Blechaczâ€™s way with the long Op. 44 Polonaise (track 5, from 1841) as notable.  I agree â€“ this interpretation is vivid.  Like the â€œSerbianâ€ Poloniase I mention above, the big Op.  44 Polonaise begins with almost ominous octaves in the lower range and then surges into the main melody, this time through a difficult octave passage.  The playing of this opening section here is brilliant and exciting.  Although Iâ€™m not convinced that the more lyrical ascending secondary theme marked â€œsostenutoâ€ is up to the quality level of the rest of the Polonaise, Blechacz makes the best case for Op. 44.  Other tracks are also consistently very good, including the final â€œPolonaise Fantasieâ€ (track 7, Op. 61, from 1846), with its more complex structure typical of Chopinâ€™s later works, and a successful Op. 53 Polonaise, one of the authorâ€™s most famous pieces.This is my first experience with Rafa' Blechacz and I now plan on buying all of his recordings.  Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291LYUSIVLBBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7OXZTY#wasThisHelpful","R291LYUSIVLBBP","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Bach solo piano recording from Piotr Anderszewski I have purchased.  The first one â€“ an earlier 1990s vintage recording including the Overture in the French Style on Harmonia Mundi France â€“ is terrific and whetted my appetite for more from Anderszewski, who has such a strong reputation in this repertory.  But I am mildly disappointed; the present recording has its moments but it also has its dull sections and, overall, it never seems to lift off.  Certainly not a bad release, but I was expecting more.Among Anderszewskiâ€™s strengths is his very strong and deft left hand.  This allows him to create vivid and times marvellous textures, as he has such control and sense of touch in the lower registers.  Maybe the highpoint of this release for me was the very concluding fugue that caps the ambitious Gigue of the 6th Partita.  The fugue almost seems three dimensional as the different voices are each presented with different touches.  Another success is the Allemande (2nd mvt) of the 1st Partita, nicely played with a liveliness and sense of attention.But Anderszewskiâ€™s attention comes and goes.  Often, the dances seem to just pass by; thereâ€™s an automaton-like quality to some.  The lovely Air from the 6th Partita (4th mvt) is taken sluggishly and presented without any feeling.  How could Anderszewski transform such an interesting and attractive movement with this dullness?  The Sarabande that follows the Air is a majestic and contemplative dance that Anderszewski plays without a sense of drama and grandeur and I thought the same occurred in the long Sarabande in the 1st Partita.Anderszewski sounds authoritative at times and elsewhere he sounds a bit disengaged.  He is helped by a very nice sound engineering job from Virgin.  This is a decent release but I expected more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FCE2N1DAKN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005UV9B#wasThisHelpful","R36FCE2N1DAKN7","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This RCA compilation of three different recordings from American pianist William Kapell is of uneven value.  The highpoint is the set of 10 Fredric Chopin Mazurkas, which are outstanding and distinctive and fortunately done in very good sound despite the fact that the sessions took place in 1953.  Also included are a 3rd Sonata with very dated sound from 1951/2 and finally a live 2nd Sonata from Australia where the sound is downright problematic.  My short review then: get this one for the Mazurkas, but not for the Sonatas.Kapell has a reputation for technical prowess and professional intensity, but for me what stands out about his best performances is their emotion.  This is very true of the Mazurkas here.  I also hear it in the memorable version of the Sergei Prokofiev 3rd Piano Concerto Kapell did with Antal Dorati conducting, which highlights the Concertoâ€™s emotional power.  I have been sampling a number of different Chopin Mazurka interpretations recently and each pianist brings something different to them, from Rubinsteinâ€™s natural directness to Arturo Benedetti Michelangeliâ€™s eccentric technical perfection.  When I turned to Kapellâ€™s Mazurkas, what I heard was the powerful emotions and moods that lay at the heart of Chopinâ€™s conception.  Take the A-flat Major Mazurka Op 17/3 (track 12 here); Kapell presents the outer A section with strength and a sense of tragedy matched by a particularly dramatic central â€˜Bâ€™ section.  The Op 33/1 Mazurka (track 14) is jubilant yet swinging into moody contrasts.  Kapell fully conveys the disappointed depression of the Op 41/2 Mazurka (track 16).  Kapell has something unique and personal to say about this repertory and, combined with unusually good engineering for their vintage, it justifies the entire re-release in my eyes.The 3rd Sonata has received several great recordings, including a classic version from Romanian pianist Dinu Lipatti contemporaneous with Kapellâ€™s.  The question here, as it always is for historic reissues, is whether the defects in sound are outweighed by the playing.  It most certainly is for the 10 Mazurkas but I didnâ€™t find the 3rd Sonata from Kapell distinctive enough to compensate for the dated though not awful engineering.  It is a good interpretation but just doesnâ€™t stand out.  The 2nd Sonata is to my ears more successful playing, with intensity and a sure sense of structure.  But it fails the cost/benefit balance because the session, done on acetate at a radio performance in Australia, sounds downright lousy.A very good and individual Mazurkas makes this a release Iâ€™m glad I own. Hopefully, this helps you make an informed decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUD7HOOVPAP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003EOL#wasThisHelpful","RUD7HOOVPAP4","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went back and compared this more recent Pierre Boulez recording of Anton Webern with the the older complete Webern set on Sony, done in the late 1960s with the London Symphony.  My summary is that the performances are similar â€“ Boulez has a very strong and idiomatic interpretive style â€“ with the later DG release holding a minor marginal edge over the earlier performances.The older LSO version on Sony stresses the metric regularity heard in certain portions of Webernâ€™s 12-tone work a bit more than the newer DG Boulez, which is a bit more romantic and impressionistic.  I heard the biggest difference in the orchestral Variations, the only piece where I had a clear preference for the new DG alternative.  Otherwise, differences are small.  The new DG has marginally tighter orchestral playing; it has marginally better engineering;  Christiane Oelze, the terrific soprano in the DG, is a bit more technically secure and nuanced than Halina Lukomska, the soprano in the older version.  The way Oelze confidently hits the final high note about 3â€™ into the final track of the 1st Cantata (1939) is a plus for the DG.On the other side of the ledger, I have a marginal preference for the older LSO version of â€œDas Augenlichtâ€, that very interesting short choral piece Webern wrote in 1935.  The two numbers for bass that open the 2nd Cantata (1943) are handled a bit more musically by the fine soloist, Barry McDaniel, who fronts the older LSO version.  But the quality of the performances is close.  If you already have the older version, you shouldnâ€™t necessarily spring for the DG if you are interested in the four major works from Webernâ€™s last decade included here.This disc also contains two pieces that were only discovered in the 60s, the Five Pieces for Orchestra and a set of orchestral songs, here sung by Oelze.  They date from around 1910 so have that more impressionistic sheen of Webernâ€™s purely atonal works, before he adopted his masterâ€™s 12-tone technique.  I found them a very nice discovery.  Though they had been tucked away in a folder and forgotten, they strike me as first-rate Webern.  Oelze is absolutely terrific in the 3 Songs; her strong performance is key to making this recording work.For a lark, I compared Boulez performance of the Op 21 symphony, with Herbert von Karajan's, both done with the Berlin philharmonic (and both on DG ).  I realize some readers will stop taking me seriously for saying this but I was surprised to find I preferred Karajan's -- and by a fair bit.  Karajan simply projects more personality.  It is a bold performance, the long held notes in the middle part of the 1st â€œRuhig schreitendâ€ movement rising out of the kaleidoscope of sounds assembled by Webern.  In contrast, Boulez is clearly more familiar with the musical language of the symphony, but he leads a somewhat fussy and antiseptic interpretation, that doesnâ€™t have the impact or personality of Karajanâ€™s.Although I find Webernâ€™s music â€“ especially his late 12-tone works â€“ positively inscrutable, there are very many fascinating and impressive moments in this very strong Boulez release.

"Arthur Rubinsteinâ€™s talent and origins tie directly to his approach to Frederic Chopinâ€™s music.  A native of Lodz in Poland, a few miles from Chopinâ€™s birthplace, he grew up in a culture with an intimate closeness to the composer and his musical language.  Besides being connected to Chopinâ€™s background, Rubinstein was also a phenomenal musical talent, developing perfect pitch at the age of two and showing astounding technical prowess untied to any rigorous practice regimen.  Rubinstein once presented a Franck piece with a Spanish orchestra without ever practicing it on a piano (!) and he frankly admits that he achieved his early successes on the stage without doing much practicing, only beginning to seriously learn and perfect the music in later years.  So everything suggests his having a natural and direct relationship with Chopinâ€™s Mazurkas, the set of works which perhaps most directly spring from the authorâ€™s Polish heritage.  And this is what I hear: Rubinstein is relaxed and utterly at ease playing the Mazurkas.Take the interesting and dissonant opening to the well-known Op. 24/4 Mazurka, which can -- and has been -- presented stringently.  Rubinstein is gentler and tapers off the initial tempo as he takes the introduction into the main section; this slowing down is done with wonderful effortlessness.  The dotted rhythms in the main section of this Op 24/4 are done with perfect grace, yet Rubinstein still inflects the piece with drama and emotional power at the minor climaxes which conclude the main A section.  The slightly mysterious wistfulness of the Op. 33/4 Mazurka is similarly done with ease and sensitivity, the left-hand interjections in the bass presented in an uncomplicated way.Deft handling of the metric and rhythmic ambiguities is found throughout this set.  Chopin inserted a sort of shift into the contrasting passage in the â€˜Aâ€™ section of the Op. 59/3 Mazurka.  Rubinstein presents it so naturally that one can forget the difficulties the shift presents.  This is just a sampling of the beautiful playing in this set.  I could go on for much longer.But Rubinsteinâ€™s easygoing charm does imposes a few limitations. Intensity varies: the great C#-minor Mazurka Op 50/3 lacks the passion of certain other interpretations.  Some other more serious Mazurkas fare better.  The quietly tragic Op 56/3 Mazurka is done with genuine feeling.  Any interpretive approach will de-emphasize musical or emotional dimensions of great music like the Mazurkas â€“ and the downsides of Rubinsteinâ€™s take are few and offset by instance after instance of wonderful sensitivity and directness.I have been sampling a number of Mazurka performances from other pianists, using the Rubinstein set as a reference with all of them included.  Rubinsteinâ€™s is the one I enjoy most.  The sound engineering though from a few decades back is actually very good.  This is one classic version that surpasses expectations.

"I was recently bowled over by Khatia Buniatishviliâ€™s Franz Liszt disc, an honest-to-god great recording, even a landmark one.  Based on that experience, I hurried to get her Chopin disc.  It is not quite up to the Liszt but nevertheless is very good and has a few tracks that are memorable and outstanding.The interpretation that caught my ear was the 2nd Sonata, where Buniatishvili emphasizes its lyrical side.  This sometimes terse and dramatic Sonata can sound very different.  Evgeny Kissinâ€™s excellent 2000 recording on RCA shines by emphasizing the aggression and energy of the opening â€˜Doppio movimentoâ€™, the outer sections of the Scherzo and the terse finale.  Buniatishvili shines on the other hand in the more lyrical sections.  Her version of the slow central â€˜Bâ€™ section of the â€˜Scherzoâ€™ is ravishing â€“ just this couple of minutes justifies the entire release.  Equally exquisite is the famous slow section of the Funeral March which follows â€“ this is playing that makes time stand still.The 4th Ballade is also presented very well.  This is one of Chopinâ€™s best compositions, in my humble opinion, and the Ballade can be presented from many angles.  Buniatishvili does it both a bit more quickly than many other competing versions but also more gently.  The idea of distant lands in the Ballade is a call from far away in her hands and not an adventure.  There is also a sense of large-scale architectural thinking here, something very apparent in Buniatishviliâ€™s powerful Liszt Sonata in B minor.  Even 3 or 4 minutes into the 4th Ballade, Buniatishvili is still building towards something, finally realized in a fiery concluding coda.  This is a terrific performance, to set next to my own favorite, Bela Davidovichâ€™s glamorous version, and displays Buniatishviliâ€™s particular strengths, her ability to construct long paragraphs of music and to re-think familiar repertory from the ground up.Also included are very appealing versions of the famous Op 17/4 Mazurka and the Op 64/2 Waltz.  The weakest part of this release is the performance of the early 2nd Concerto, done with Paavo Jarvi and the Orchestre de Paris.  Iâ€™m at a bit of a loss to explain why this interpretation doesnâ€™t work for me.  All the musicians involved play with energy and commitment, but they arenâ€™t helped by a very mediocre sound engineering job from Sony (thereâ€™s a surprise â€“ yes, Iâ€™m being sarcastic).  Itâ€™s one of those presentations that puzzlingly sounds a bit rushed, the moments in between different phrases not quite right and the pianist and orchestra, though all the notes are done perfectly, not aligned perfectly in terms of timing.Buniatishvili is clearly a major talent; I look forward to her future releases with anticipation.  This disc is uneven but the performances of the 2nd Sonata and the Ballade make it a notable release.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2101ZDTT1RNEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085MK2BM#wasThisHelpful","R2101ZDTT1RNEG","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a master class several decades ago, I heard Janos Starker deliver the following advice: â€œStudents often ask me how to prepare for a concert.  I tell them to leave plenty of time.  Dress at home, slowly.  Make sure youâ€™ve had a small meal before the event so youâ€™re not hungry.  Drive to the concert hall slowly, leaving plenty of time for mishaps and arriving well ahead of time.  When you get to the concert hall, warm up a lit, leaving time to become comfortable with the hall.  Next, you go into the rest room and throw up.  Now, youâ€™re ready to go onstage and perform.â€Clearly the guy had a sense of humor, but his musical personality is different, stark and severe.  These famous recordings of the six solo JS Bach Suites for cello, paired with two of Bachâ€™s Sonatas for cello and piano done with fellow Hungarian Ã©migrÃ© to the American midwest, Gyorgy Sebok, are cornerstone midcentury baroque recordings.  Dating from 1963and 1965, the engineering holds up pretty well and still sounds good, not surprising coming from the esteemed Mercury label, although the sound of the cello is bare rather than lush.Starkerâ€™s interpretation of the very beautiful 5th Suite reveals him at his best.  The Prelude of this Suite, with the noble dotted rhythms typical of this overture form, sees Starkerâ€™s severity projected with power, a power which extends to the fugal 2nd section which follows.  There is a real sense of forward momentum in this fugato, making for exciting listening.  I also think the 2nd Suite comes off particularly well.  The 2nd ends with a Gigue finale which can be presented in a lighter, merrier way.  Starker presents it with strength instead, the opening leaps not joyful but a launchpad into the scale runs, done with intensity and with a great sense of coherence.  The slow Prelude to the 2nd also suits Starkerl.  Constructed differently from the Prelude of the 5th suite, this 2nd suite Prelude presents a weaving and mostly even melody that builds into a climax about 2â€™ in.  It suits Starkerâ€™s temperament and he does it perfectly.With the sternness, though, there can come a drab sense of sameness, the downside of the Starker approach.  This dullness is found in the Bourree II from the 4th Suite, a beautiful, sunny â€˜Bâ€™ section built over double stops; Starker plays it like he is bored, and I was bored as a consequence.  The 4th is not as successful a performance as some others on this set and I found both Bourrees and the final Gigue sound bored, with a lack of rote sense of rhythmic fluidity not up to Starkerâ€™s formidable reputation.  I am also not fond of the two cello sonatas done with Sebok, a pianist with a sterling reputation within the profession.  Starkerâ€™s austerity, which can be so successful in the solo suites, suppresses the brio and sparkle of these sonatas, which are lighter fare.  Even the sadder portions of the sonata arenâ€™t successful.  The Sicilienne from the G major Sonata is a somber piece but it sounds dull and lacking feeling.  The thin sound of the cello in this recording also doesnâ€™t fit what I think is luxuriant music.  (I have the old LP set of these sonatas and the remastering canâ€™t be blamed for the thin sound in the sonatas; it didnâ€™t sound great on vinyl either.)  Get this set for the suites.This is beautiful playing, but of a certain type.  It is Bach without frissons, the Lutheran churchman, dour, austere, imposing.  And that would be fine -- but Starker is uneven on his own terms.  This Starker cycle, despite its reputation, doesnâ€™t equal the standard setter for the Suites, the recording from French cellist Pierre Fournier, and it doesnâ€™t match my current favorite among the modern cycles, from American cellist Zuill Bailey.  Still, I found parts of the set powerful and generally enjoyed it.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REWX0HZW7DSLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000057L9#wasThisHelpful","REWX0HZW7DSLQ","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before covering the performance, I must underline that the music Krystian Zimerman plays is some of the most incredible ever written.  Chopinâ€™s 4th Ballade, the Barcarolle and the F minor Fantasie back to back?  Each is an inspired masterpiece from Chopinâ€™s peak.  The first three Ballades are no slouches either.  So the selections are fantastic and make for an hour of spellbinding listening.What about Zimermanâ€™s performance?  It is studied and perfectionist.  The placement of each note and each chord is carefully considered and then carefully practiced.  Articulations are varied; the different lines and accompaniment harmonies are played with precision.  An upper echelon technician, Zimerman is in fine form here.  And there is thought put into the interpretations as well.  I wouldnâ€™t call his interpretation cerebral; self-conscious is a better word.  I could feel the weight of many excellent prior interpretations of this familiar music on Zimermanâ€™s shoulders as I listened to his playing.  Each of the six pieces found here have a big, rousing final section, some of them absolutely wonderful.  As he builds into them, I didnâ€™t feel much sense of relief, but rather Zimermanâ€™s conscious thought that passion and excitement needed to be generated now.  I think listeners just getting to know this Chopin wonâ€™t experience this particularly strongly â€“ Zimerman after all is an outstanding pianist and the attention to detail here is impressive â€“ but some who know it well will feel this is all a bit stilted.There are outright successes here.  I really enjoyed the big concluding section of the 2nd Ballade, where Zimerman just seems to be freer.  The sense of momentum and enthusiasm makes for really beautiful musicmaking.  The details in the first section of the Barcarolle are jewel-like, with Zimermanâ€™s precision and control coming out in the best light.  But there are weak points, too.  The 4th Ballade â€“ a favorite of mine, with its intimations of the exoticism and distant lands â€“ is just a bore (strange to ever find myself applying this adjective to this composition!). In the Fantasie, the open sections dotted rhythm contrasting theme suggests a funeral march, making the whole section a sort of premonition of death.  None of that sense of tragedy comes out of Zimermanâ€™s playing.So this disc is a mixed success.  I also want to complain about the sound engineering.  Audiophiles have been complaining about DG sonics for decades and this disc -- fuzzy and with a weird piano timbre -- is a case in point.  Zimerman provides a fine effort that obviously has generated a lot of throughtful reactions from other people, as you can tell from the interesting reviews here on Amazon.  But it wonâ€™t replace my favorite versions of these pieces â€“ Bela Davidvoch in the Ballades, Dinu Lipatti of course in the Barcarolle, and Shura Cherkassky in the Fantasie â€“ although it is a creditable, accomplished effort.  I just wish Zimerman had felt less on the spot and more liberated to give us what he has in many of his other very fine recordings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHVFY3B4MHVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001G8Q#wasThisHelpful","R3UHVFY3B4MHVL","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™ve had a longstanding fascination with Bedrich Smetanaâ€™s 2nd quartet.  Though it is an overlooked piece, the Lindsay Quartet, in their recording on the ASV label, have given us an interpretation that emphasizes the pieceâ€™s terse, compact and almost aphoristic character.  After reading that the Prazak were viewed as leading interpreters of Smetanaâ€™s pair of quartets, I sought out their version.  The comparison with the Lindsayâ€™s was very interesting and forced some careful listening and thought.  The Prazak are superior in terms of musicality on the phrase-by-phrase level. This is true of this entire recording; the lines flow and are presented with flexibility and sensitivity throughout.  There also is a sense of conviction in the playing.  But at the same time their 2nd quartet didnâ€™t strike me as remarkable or unusual.  In the Lindsayâ€™s hands, it stands out from other late romantic chamber music.  Not longwinded, but nervously shifting between short phrases, full of contrasts, all bunched into four brusque movements coming in at about 18 minutes.  There is something â€œout of timeâ€ about the 2nd.  But that unusual tinge of non-romanticism didnâ€™t strike me as I repeatedly listened to the Prazakâ€™s performance.The disc overall is good.  The most famous work here is the â€œFrom My Lifeâ€ Quartet, with its autobiographical basis and that strident moment in the finale which represents the hearing diseases (tinnitus?) that afflicted Smetana in his later years.  The Prazak, as in the 2nd quartet, is unfailingly musical, but they also tend to overplay, with a lack of textural variation.  Their approach is not helped by a flawed digital recording with a tendency towards harshness.The Prazakâ€™s lead violinist, Vaclav Remes, joins with pianist Sachiko Kayahara for a performance of the rarely-performed duo â€œFrom the homelandâ€ (1880).  Remesâ€™ playing as a solo violinist here illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of the Prazak Quartet: he is highly musical but also unstintingly applies high levels of vibrato.  I drew the conclusion that all four of the Prazak members really lay on the vibrato and that lends their sound a uniform and thick quality.  Some listeners will enjoy this; personally, I prefer a performance style more reliant on coloristic and timbral variety.With the inclusion of â€œFrom the Homelandâ€, the Prazak presents all three chamber works from the painful last decade of Smetanaâ€™s life, the quartets being completed in 1875 and 1883, the last one written a few months before his death.  This is valuable.  While it looks to me like â€œFrom the Homelandâ€ was written to make a buck, as it was commissioned by a German publisher interested in Eastern European style music, I enjoyed getting to know it, especially the second part, which is played very nicely by Remes and Kayahara.So I have some criticisms but I do recognize the quality and attractions of the Prazakâ€™s performance.  A solid 4-star effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYC2FYUI7HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000J81Q#wasThisHelpful","RVYC2FYUI7HY","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Italian pianist Aldo Ciccolini, who just died earlier this year (2015), had a strong reputation as a performer of Franz Liszt's music.  I admire his wonderful recording of Emmanuel Chabrierâ€™s â€˜Pieces pittoresquesâ€ but I find this complete recording of Lisztâ€™s â€œAnnees de Pelerinageâ€ mixed in quality, although it has its moments.Ciccolini plays the more traditional, early romantic works from the â€œAnneesâ€ with a winning directness.  His interpretation of the â€œBells of Genevaâ€, from the first Swiss Annee, exemplifies Ciccoliniâ€™s performance style.  The â€œBellsâ€ is often approached as an atmospheric study, with a focus on its pure sound.  Ciccolini takes it quickly and emphasizes clarity and the foreground melody.  It is a straightforward performance that relegates the pianistic and tonal effects to a background characteristic.  While I enjoyed it, I donâ€™t think the piece emerged in a particularly memorable way.  The long â€œVallee dâ€™Obermanâ€, also from the Swiss Annee, is done simply and with a crisp tempo but the result is affecting and cohesive.  Again, a nice performance that I enjoyed but one that doesnâ€™t tap the depth of â€œdâ€™Oberman.â€While the first two Annees are mostly successful interpretations with a specific viewpoint, Ciccolini I think trips up in an unsuccessful 3rd Annee, a set from Lisztâ€™s austere and experimental final period.  The 3rd Annee badly needs an excellent recording as my listening history with it over the years has involved one disappointment after another.  Unfortunately, Ciccoliniâ€™s version here is part of this unsatisfying group.  The playing has a stridency and a lack of attention to the pianoâ€™s potential for coloristic touches that for example completely fails to bring out the beauty in the well-known â€œFountains of the Villa dâ€™esteâ€.  I also felt an aimlessness, the lack of any particular point of view in the two ambitious â€œCypres of the Villa dâ€™esteâ€ that join the â€œJeux dâ€™eauxâ€ as a sort of central trilogy.  These â€œCypresâ€ are, according to some writers, masterpieces of Lisztâ€™s late period, yet Ciccolini is less inspired and also less sure-handed with them.  I also thought the stridency, and the tendency to bang the keyboard harmed the interesting short piece â€œSursum Corda.â€If he had performed a strong 3rd Annee, this would have raised the set into a cornerstone Liszt recording, given the quality of the first two Annees and the need for a very good 3rd.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  One alternative recording that I recommend is Alfred Brendelâ€™s very successful 2nd Annee from Italy.  Ciccolini is helped by a pretty good EMI recording job, which shows some age but is still pleasant and revealing.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMY2PPUUF46OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000006DEP#wasThisHelpful","RMY2PPUUF46OP","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Crossover into popular music structure: the performers may be a string quartet, but the formal structure of the selection of pieces here is popular.  They typically are constructed from a verse and chorus, with some bridges and introductions thrown in.  To me this is the defining aspect of this album: it doesnâ€™t have the formal variety found in classical or art music, but hews to the typical verse/chorus structure of pop songs. The listening experience is far closer to taking in a Paul Simon album than Dmitri Shostakovich.Crossover into the polyculture: Most other compositions or albums grow from a single musical culture, often a very specific, localized one.  â€œCaravanâ€ is different in character and telescopes out to bring us flavors from many regions.  Not rooted in place, it is a â€œtravelogue,â€ the styles originating from Eastern Europe, Bollywood, Argentina, California, Mideastern Arab culture and Iberia.Any compilation of recent music will be of uneven quality.  Several of the compositions have been very rewarding.  Iâ€™ll point to the two numbers from Carlos Paredes, an older composer from Portugal, the mournful â€œCancao Verdesâ€ and the Romance No.1, which to my mind is closest to an â€œartâ€ composition of any of the selections in â€œCaravan.â€  I also enjoyed â€œAaj Ki Ratâ€ from Indian composer Rahul Burman quite a bit.  Many of the selections were arranged for the Kronos by well-known Argentine/US composer Osvaldo Golijov.I have great respect for the Kronos Quartet, a very high quality ensemble both technically and artistically, and they live up to their high standards here, providing engaged, musical and accomplished playing pretty much through the entire disc.  For example, the playing of the sliding intro to â€œLa muerte Chiquitaâ€ from Mexican rock songwriter Enrique Rangel is beautifully executed.  They are also recorded well â€“ the disc sounds very good.  Is the album perfect?  No, there are some clunkers here.  In particular, I will point to the abomination from Terry Riley (â€œCortejo Funebreâ€), an artist the Kronos have long championed.  I also thought the final track, â€œMisirlou Twistâ€ from Nicholas Roubanis, is a yawner.  But there are also some really fine efforts from little-known composers.  It also serves well as background music, if you are able to skip over the Terry Riley track.  I enjoyed getting to know this album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUZCB8WNUBUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004S92N#wasThisHelpful","R3UUZCB8WNUBUO","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mixed is how Iâ€™d describe the results of French pianist Jean-Louis Steuermanâ€™s 1987 performance of Alexander Scriabin solo piano music.  Steuerman has impressive technical command of what is some very taxing music and he sometimes imprints it with real emotional oomph but he also has a tendency, repeatedly shown, for a dry, too clinical and emotionally uninvolved playing of Scriabin.Although I found the performances of both the 3rd and 4th piano sonatas that start off the disc as disappointing, Iâ€™ll first focus on Steuermanâ€™s rendition of the beautiful Poem Op. 32 no. 1 to illustrate his interpretive weaknesses.  This is a short, glowing and ecstatic piece of tone painting, the patterns spreading out into a vibrant set of chords supporting the calm and memorable main theme.  Steuerman executes the notes perfectly with admirable sensitivity to the polyphonic writing embedded into the Poem, but there is also a very clear lack of feeling or understanding of what Scriabin intended.  Steuerman is playing the notes only.  The 4th sonata, that short jewel of fin-de-siecle messianic spiritualism, should glow with the impending arrival of a new age, but in Steuermanâ€™s hands, the sense of excitement is not to be found.  I was also disappointed in the lack of power in his performance of the 3rd sonata; a comparison with Emil Gilelsâ€™ tremendous 3rd from the Soviet era shows just the sort of enthusiasm and fervor that is lacking.That said, Steuerman has his moments.  I enjoyed his playing of the 5th sonata, the summoning of â€œmysterious forcesâ€.  His technical command of the rumbling passage that begins and ends the sonata allows him to do it exceptionally swiftly, which I thought worked, and I appreciated the excitement he brings to the crescendo to the final climax of the main section, where the theme marked as â€œAllegro fantasticoâ€ is repeated in a falling sequence.  Steuermanâ€™s 5th struck me as being on another, better level than much of the rest of the disc.  He also has included miniatures from Opp. 34, 44 and 57.The recorded sound is pretty good, especially for its era.  Steuermanâ€™s disc was released at a time when Scriabin recordings were relatively hard to come by.  In todayâ€™s era, with Scriabin better represented in the discography, I can name several versions of each of the works contained here that I prefer by a fair margin, with the possible exception of the 5th, where I find Steuermanâ€™s effort very creditable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGVPJ4TNGIO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008FJGX#wasThisHelpful","R1BGVPJ4TNGIO2","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vladimir Feltsman has paired two major late Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas here, the Op. 101 in A from 1816 and the famed and massive â€œHammerklavierâ€ Sonata Op. 106 completed in 1819.  The more successful performance here in my view is the Op. 101 sonata, but the Op. 106 sonata also is worthwhile and, while not my favorite version, is enjoyable and musical.Feltsman takes a lyrical approach to the Op. 101.  The opening Allegretto is done more softly and slowly than I am used to, a conception which I find compelling as the piece gains a more unified and coherent aspect from Feltsmanâ€™s gentleness.  The March which follows contrasts pretty strongly, the dotted rhythms not brought out aggressively but with assertion.  I particularly enjoyed Feltsmanâ€™s way with the fugal Allegro which concludes the Op. 101 â€“ it is an alive and creative presentation of one of Beethovenâ€™s late fugal experiments.The big Op. 106 sonata is given a less exceptional performance.  Feltsman presents what I would call a balanced view.  My favorite performance of the â€œHammerklavierâ€ is from Christoph Eschenbach, who projects great intensity, especially in a very slow but absolutely memorable â€œAdagio sostenutoâ€ that clocks in at over 20 minutes.  Feltsmanâ€™s playing of the Adagio is more traditional and also quicker, with a time of about 16 minutes.  It is a nice version, and one which I enjoyed, but here and in the transition into the big fugal finale, a baroque-tinged fantasy-like passage that is one of my favorite portions of the Op. 106, he doesnâ€™t bring the intensity Iâ€™ve heard from some other pianists.Sound quality is good.  This isnâ€™t a great recording, but itâ€™s a good one marked by a particularly successful Op. 101 Sonata.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ24RN35TSMLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000006NKV#wasThisHelpful","RZ24RN35TSMLU","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arkady Volodos plays the solo piano music of Franz Liszt found here with an emphasis on color and sensitivity and nuance.  He starts off with the â€œVal dâ€™Obermannâ€, from the First Year of Pilgrimage, an ambitious composition that I have found over the years is susceptible to radically different interpretations.  Volodosâ€™ vision of â€œValâ€ is coloristically precise, with more emphasis on the polyphonic lines weaving through the textures, very different from performances which, to mention some options, emphasize the pieceâ€™s reliance on a small set of chord shifts or more emotion-centric ones that focus on the workâ€™s depression and sense of tragedy.  The emphasis on the color allows for the climactic passage towards the end (about 10â€™ into track 1) to be especially vivid and rich as done by Volodos.Volodos has an absolutely marvelous control of the exact weight and pressure applied by his hands.  The â€œmicro-controlâ€ of each note is at times astonishing.  An austere late piece written to commemorate the death of Richard Wagner, the â€œLugubre Gondole Iâ€ (track 9) benefits from Volodosâ€™ ability to shape the slow-moving lines with subtle dynamic variations within the individual melody.  This style of performance doesnâ€™t just benefit some of the more atmospheric numbers.  The  â€œWeinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagenâ€ Prelude, a delicious example of mid-romantic Bach-iana, is given a fine performance, the individual lines differentiated coloristically so as to fully bring out the musicâ€™s polyphonic conception.This emphasis on preciousness and color and detail can de-energize the music, almost as an automatic by-product.  So Volodosâ€™ Liszt isnâ€™t fiery or wild, two adjectives commonly associated with the composer.  The 13th Hungarian Rhapsody (track 5) is likely the least successful track here.  It is tamed and Liszt the demonic Magyar begins to turn into the sensuous sonneteer.  Volodos manages to project more energy in the final ostinato build-up from â€œFuneraillesâ€ (track 8), so the 13th Rhapsody seems more flawed than it should, even given Volodosâ€™ approach.Overall the performance is outstanding, original and shows yet again that Volodos is a world-class musician, even disregarding his phenomenal piano chops.  I have highlighted certain tracks so far but others, such as the â€œIl pensorosoâ€ (track 2) and the wonderful â€œEn reveâ€ (track 10), are very effective.  Audiophiles have been entranced by the sound engineering job given Volodos by Sony.  I found the sound on this disc too reverberant but very detailed during the cleaner passages.  All in all, this is a terrific Liszt recital that I know I will be pulling out for decades to come.  Warmly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9MBB6ROIQ99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RY027A#wasThisHelpful","RG9MBB6ROIQ99","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With his recordings of Beethoven piano sonatas, Friedrich Gulda took steps down an unusual road in this musicâ€™s performance history.  Gulda chose to strongly constrain metric and tempo flexibility so the music arises from a very steady beat, the foundation a rigid bedrock.  As an idea this can strike one as too cerebral, corralling the pianist into a narrow range of emotion.  In practice, I found this disc to be refreshing emotionally and at times very moving.  The precious and indulgent is excised completely and what is left is a direct and straightforward presentation that seems to fit Beethovenâ€™s conception so truly.The approach is particularly successful in the much-loved â€œPastoralâ€ sonata, Op. 28.  Gulda plays the opening movement at a pretty snappy pace and maintains the meter very evenly.  But this is not at all a dull or faceless performance. Iâ€™ve found the opening Allegro is generally played with some rubato (tempo flexibility) to present expression. Guldaâ€™s direct simplicity instead eliminates a tendency to mawkishness and intensifies the serene sense of meaning held by the Allegro.  It is given an absolutely wonderful interpretation of -- and I have heard many. Guldaâ€™s approach to the famed Andante that follows is also pretty fast and, as with the Allegro, the approach leads to great expressivity, but one joined to a sense of momentum.  One aspect of the performance is worth clarifying and the opening Allegro of the Pastorale can be used as an example: when Beethoven tells the player to slow down, Gulda does so.  Gulda simply reduces greatly the tempo variation when no written instructions are found in the score.Gulda also stands out in an excellent performance of the Op. 13 â€œPathetique.â€  The tempo may be rigid but the exciting cadential passage that concludes each of the fast inner sections in the opening movement are energetic and vital.  Gulda made an exception to his general style, it seems to me, in the brilliant opening Allegro con brio of the â€œWaldsteinâ€ Sonata Op. 53, where he infuses the score with as many tempo fluctuations as in more mainstream performances.  His â€Waldsteinâ€ is strong and enjoyable, but it would be interesting to know why Gulda felt the need to do the Allegro con brio differently.  The disc also includes the lesser known and short two-movement Op. 54 sonata written the same year as the â€œWaldsteinâ€ (1804).So Guldaâ€™s sonatas are not an experiment but a very good and at times downright great re-envisioning of some familiar compositions.  The one criticism I would make of it is that the sound quality on this re-issue is quite mediocre.  Guldaâ€™s instrument is robbed of richness and the sound is a tad echo-y without being rich.  But if you are interested in unusual takes on the sonatas, Gulda â€“ a man who always thought for himself and played music in the way he considered artistically true â€“ has given us an exploration that helps bring forth the sonatasâ€™ sincerity, emotion and meaning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3OUTJR40HNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y39NV2#wasThisHelpful","R2E3OUTJR40HNA","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A return to a work of art can sometimes be a rejuvenating rediscovery, the thrill reborn.  Or it can be a deadened retread, executed professionally but passionlessly.  Alfred Brendelâ€™s version of Beethovenâ€™s famed â€œWaldsteinâ€ Sonata Op. 53 found here is the latter kind, shot through with the greyness of middle age.  Brendel sounds bored here, like heâ€™s heard this piece a few thousand times â€“ which no doubt is true.  Whatâ€™s more, there is a surprising lack of technical proficiency.  The difficult opening Allegro con brio of the â€œWaldsteinâ€ is marked by difficult figurations and runs throughout; Brendelâ€™s execution of the passage work lacks precision, not just gusto.  This sloppiness can also be heard elsewhere.  The fugato subject in the opening Menuetto movement of the Sonata Op. 54 in F is not as tight as one would expect from a world-class pianist.  I found the same thing to be true of the finale of the Op. 54 but Iâ€™ll give Brendel a pass on this track, as Iâ€™ve always found this Allegretto difficult to project without blurred rhythms and a sheen of sloppiness.  The Andante favori which Beethoven originally wrote as the middle movement of the â€œWaldsteinâ€ is included here and holds the same sense of boredom as the rest of Op. 53.The ambitious A-major Sonata, Op. 101, fortunately is done better.  The opening Allegretto and the finale of the Op. 101 are to my ears the best part of this release.  While I found the technical execution better than in the â€˜Waldsteinâ€™, more importantly Brendel sounds engaged here, like he is interested in playing this music.  This is a difficult sonata for the listener.  Though I donâ€™t think contains the appealing freedom and sense of adventure of the 3 late sonatas (Op. 109 110 and 111) that followed it or the Delphic mystery of the late string quartets, it shows real thought and a feeling of exploration.  Written in 1816, after Beethovenâ€™s lapse into a temporary silence and at the inception point of his late period, it sounds like a transitional work, without the cryptic and beyond-human aspects of the later sonatas and string quartets from later on.  A bit drab and tired of grand and aggressive gestures, maybe the greyness and middle agedness of Op. 101 make it a more interesting piece for Brendel, because his performance his very creditable. Itâ€™s not a great version, and it unfortunately occasionally lapses into the sloppiness heard in the â€œWaldsteinâ€ (for example, in the middle section of the engaging Vivace alla marcia), but itâ€™s one where the pianist is alive to the music.Sound is fairly good.  This is not a terrific CD but if youâ€™re interested in the Op. 101 sonata, itâ€™s a pretty good choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTY71GG8TGZA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018NVN2W#wasThisHelpful","RTY71GG8TGZA3","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pianist Martha Argerich and cellist Mischa Maisky deliver another very characteristic recital of cello and piano duets, this time recorded in Kyoto, Japan in 2000.  The music as far as I can tell was all written in Paris so the program is neatly unified.Argerich and Maisky as always play with a great deal of freedom and rhythmic nuance, and this is obvious from the very first phrase of the Chopin Cello Sonata (1846), which Argerich presents with poise and sensitivity.  Though the performance of the sonata is excellent throughout, the final couple of minutes of the Largo are just remarkable, the luxuriant music presented with calm freedom.I am a big fan of Claude Debussyâ€™s Cello Sonata (1915) and one of the big â€“ and pleasant â€“ discoveries is hearing Maisky and Argerich put together what is probably the best performance of this sonata Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of hearing.  Like elsewhere, the two musicians are utterly at ease and play with a great deal of freedom.  This is a Cello Sonata that emphasizes the spectacular diversity of sounds and textural effects.  The inner Serenade, which has always struck me as an easily-overlooked intermezzo in between the striking outer movements, receives intense attention from Maisky and Argerich, who generate a rich palette of timbres and effects.The disc also contains a transcription for cello and piano of Cesar Franckâ€™s famous Violin Sonata.  I approached this performance with skepticism â€“ a transcription of a great work like the Franck?  To my surprise, Maisky presents the string part so effectively that it left me wondering whether this transcription actually didnâ€™t work better than the original scoring for violin.  Maybe only Maisky â€“ a free, almost impetuous cellist â€“ can bring this off.  But the result is beautiful and very natural.  The disc concludes with Chopinâ€™s slight and early Introduction and Polonaise brilliant (a teenage work from 1830).You can tell from my comments that this is a remarkable chamber music recording, which completely lives up to the stellar reputations of Argerich and Maisky.  The one criticism I have is a thin-sounding and not particularly textured sound engineering job from DG.  (Audience sounds are edited out successfully.)  But the performances are just so terrific â€“ they veer all the way from the very good to the downright brilliant â€“ that the sonic flaws should be overlooked.  A must-hear disc for the serious classical music fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMIOJMN0QM3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005ND48#wasThisHelpful","R3BMIOJMN0QM3K","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Baroque recording has a special and fond place in my heart as it converted me into a die-hard fan of Heinrich Schutz.  Schutzâ€™s emotional and melodic art is anything but dusty; its sincerity traverses the cultural chasm which lies between Schutz and ourselves.  I continue to find Schutzâ€™s â€œmini-requiemâ€ the â€œMusikalische Exequienâ€ (1636), a half-hour-long cantata for solo voices, choir and small instrumental group, particularly beautiful.  Since first listening to this disc, Iâ€™ve come to know the Symphoniae sacrae and other central Schutz works, but the Exequien holds its appeal.So how does this Swiss recording conducted by Hans-Martin Linde hold up?  It may not be perfect but itâ€™s still beautiful.  The performance is helped by some talented soloists, including countertenor James Bowman and tenors Ian Partridge and Nigel Rogers. Lindeâ€™s approach is half-way between early music and traditional Baroque performance styles.  The performance uses a choir, but not a particularly big one.  A countertenor has a significant role in the Exequien, but the soloists donâ€™t shy away from a restrained vibrato.  The instrumental forces are limited, with the three violins and eleven brass players, but they provide a letâ€™s say expansive support to the voices.  Linde takes things at a fairly stately, moderated pace, but the performance is very musical, with some tempo flexibility.  I thought the choral and instrumental groups generally do well.  The transitions between soloists and choral segments are handled adeptly, which helps the Exequien flow nicely.The Exequien is paired with a Pslam setting, number 136, a more majestic and I think less interesting work from earlier on in Schutzâ€™s career (1619).  As the Psalm is a fairly short work, coming in at under 10 minutes, this is a short disc.  The release dates from 1980 and it suffers from a downright mediocre sound engineering job, unrefined and blunt, although thankfully not annoying.  Despite some flaws, what is here is engaging and always fresh and honest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MAHIKEAUVQTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIDDOC#wasThisHelpful","R2MAHIKEAUVQTF","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vladimir Sofronitsky, probably the leading performer of Alexander Scriabin, combines an awe-inspiring command of the pianoâ€™s range of timbral colors with an ability to convey the musicâ€™s long-range structure and what I always feel is an innate understanding of what the music means.  That last point is important because Scriabin considered his music a path towards spiritual enlightenment and not as a purely aesthetic creation.  Sofronitskyâ€™s place as a Scriabin performer helps make this release from specialty label Chant du Monde particularly valuable and enjoyable.  The release compiles six different live performances made in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The sound quality varies but, for several of the tracks, it is good and doesnâ€™t detract at all from the enjoyment of the pianism.  Crowd sounds are few throughout the disc. That said, this is a disc for Scriabin fans, despite the very capable remastering work by the labelâ€™s editors.  General listeners should seek out more modern recordings.The six sonatas included here are among Scriabinâ€™s most adventurous efforts.  I feel that Sofronitski is at his best when Scriabin had ventured past the brand of post romantic writing he channeled in his earlier years a.  His playing of Scriabinâ€™s is later work, intensely mystical and constructed from his characteristic rapturous assemblage of symmetrical modal scales and exotic tonal effects, shows a particularly strong affinity.  Highlights found on this Chant du Monde release include Sofronitskyâ€™s 10th sonata which I have thought for years was a reference recording, with its sensuous yet polyphonically-conceived whole-tone slow section.  The live 9th sonata which Sofronitsky recorded at the Moscow Conservatory I believe in 1960 has always been for me one of the peaks of Scriabin playing.  The version contained here is a different one, dating from June 1958, but still brings forth Sofronitskyâ€™s utterly assured rendition, both architectural and mystical.  Sofronitskyâ€™s ability to convey this musicâ€™s structural dimension is for me always striking.  A particularly good example is the re-transition into the coda of the 5th sonata, with its recap of the compositionâ€™s opening rumbling flurry of notes. Another highpoint here is the introduction of the second theme in the Andante of the 4th sonata, about 1â€™30â€ into track 2, where the falling cascade of notes is combined with the surging second theme first appearance.  Sofroniskyâ€™s performance of this 4th sonata is jewel-like and utterly brilliant.The recordings compiled here are:3rd sonata â€“ June 1958 â€“ some noise in the upper register, the least good sound quality on the release4th â€“ May 1960 â€“ one of the best sounding tracks here5th â€“ January 1955 â€“ pretty good sound8th â€“ June 1958 â€“ sounds better than the 3rd although itâ€™s from the same event9th â€“ June 1958  â€“ some noise in certain louder passages in the treble but actually very good sound outside of those few passages10th â€“ Feb. 1960 â€“ decent, Iâ€ve certainly enjoyed this performance over years of owning this disc(The three June 1958 tracks come from a recital at the Moscow Conservatory that has been released elsewhere by Denon and Vista Vera.)So I strongly recommend this disc for Scriabin fans.  Chant du Monde also released a companion compilation of Sofronitsky live performances from the 1940s and 1950s, assembling a complete set of Op. 8 Etudes and Op. 11 Preludes from a diverse set of sources. That Preludes/Etudes disc, although it is an impressive curatorial effort, doesnâ€™t have the same consistency of quality of this Sonatas disc.  5 stars for this one, as long as you belong to its intended audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPPQ8HZFE3K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BISFTVI#wasThisHelpful","R1MPPQ8HZFE3K8","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short but often incredibly beautiful release of Heinrich Schutzâ€™s sacred music is a very good entrÃ©e into this excellent composerâ€™s work.  It includes the â€œMusikalische Exequien,â€ a funeral cantata from 1636 that lasts a bit under half an hour, along with some selections for vocal ensemble from the 1630s and 40s.The â€œMusikalischen Exequienâ€ is the piece that was my first introduction to Schutz a couple of decades ago.  It is melodic and highly appealing and, like much of Schutzâ€™s music, emotionally open.  Although the Exequien presents with Schutzâ€™s typical sobriety, the cantata is neither somber nor tragic.  The interpretation found here from Chapelle Royale and leading early music conductor Philippe Herreweghe may not be perfect but its strengths are so evident that Iâ€™d place it among the handful of the finest Schutz recordings Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of hearing.  Herreweghe gives us a very polished rendition, with tight ensemble, outstanding solo and choral singing and a flowing sense of line that presents the Exequien as elegiac and harmonious.  The sheer sonic beauty of this interpretation is often astounding; it is a real joy.  Why isnâ€™t it perfect?  Herreweghe accentuates the workâ€™s calm perfection and understates its bare emotion.  For example, the entrance of the soloists about 2â€™ into the long first section, â€œâ€Nacket bin,â€ is typically declamatory and speeded up slightly, which I think allows the music to take flight to express mourning.  Herreweghe rigidly maintains the tempo, with no speeding up, something he very intently does throughout this entire disc.  I have no doubt this was a conscious decision on his part, but I think it robs the music of some of its potential.  That criticism aside, I found listening to this version of the â€œExequienâ€ incredibly rewarding.  Just a beautiful performance.Aside from the Exequien, 6 shorter sacred works are included, pulled from a number of different collections from the time period of the Exequien, all for groups of solo vocalists with and without continuo accompaniment.  Extracted from the â€œSacred choral musicâ€ of 1648, the motet â€œSelig sind die Totenâ€ (track 5) is so wonderful that it is worth acquiring this release just for it alone.  For eight solo singers, Schutz builds the motet from an upward turn which is worked into a rich contrapuntal fabric.  The ensemble here, which includes leading singers like bass Peter Kooy and soprano Agnes Mellon, provides a performance where each voice is distinguished by a different timbre, so that â€œSelig sindâ€ appears almost like a kaleidoscope of colors.  This ravishing motet is my favorite but other listeners may derive great pleasure from the other ensemble works, which are often absolutely lovely.The sound recording is both terrific and marked by occasional noise in the treble.  When that noise isnâ€™t present, it sounds just great, something which is very important for a performance style like Herrewegheâ€™s.  Obviously, I loved this release.  If you are interested in learning about Schutz, try this out; if you are a Schutz fan already, you will want to hear Herrewegheâ€™s interpretation.  Warmly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RURD82YQ0LAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M5AT76#wasThisHelpful","R3RURD82YQ0LAQ","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The subjects Peter Gabriel deals with in the eight songs found in â€œSecurityâ€ point to the albumâ€™s general theme:Rhythm of the Heat: African religionsSan Jacinto: Native American mythologyThe Family and the Fishing Net: Caribbean SanteriaAnd the subjects of modern western existence:I have the touch: Craving for human contactShock the Monkey: The cruelty of scientific researchLay your hands on me: A yearning for belief in a post-Christian worldWallflower: Madness as resistanceKiss of Life: an optimistic coda â€“ a better tomorrowThe mysteries and substance of non-Western cultures are contrasted with the dispiriting, dispirited loneliness of modern life.  â€œLay your hands on meâ€ is interesting because it expresses a yearning for religious rebirth, but within a western -- and I assume Christian -- context.  That may shift the way you view the things being contrasted to one between ancient religious solace and unsatisfying modern rationality.This was a favorite album of mine maybe two decades ago and I recently sat down to listen to it again, for the first time in over a decade.  Gratifyingly, itâ€™s held up quite well.  The substance of the lyrics is matched by some inspired songwriting.  And though it clearly sounds like 1980s music, it hasnâ€™t dated or aged badly.  The sounds are often intricate and rich.  The spooky opening of what I think is probably the best song on the album, â€œThe Family and the Fishing Netâ€, is a particularly good example, with (what I think are) synthesized flute sounds beginning almost inaudibly.  Bassist Tony Levinâ€™s â€œstick bassâ€ work also adds a visceral and original element to the sound.What are the flaws?  Iâ€™ll name two: Gabriel is simply not a particularly skillful lyricist.  â€œSecurityâ€ is actually better than his other work in this respect but itâ€™s really unfortunate in a terrific song like â€œFamily and the Fishing Netâ€ that there is a chorus-and-solo-response to the words â€œheadless chickens.â€  Some of the lines are evocative and meaningful, but there are some clunkers included.  The second flaw is a tendency towards over-repetitiveness.  I found the second half of the albumâ€™s big hit â€œShock the Monkeyâ€ mind-numbingly dull and would also point to â€œKiss of Lifeâ€ as too lengthy.  (This is a criticism Iâ€™d make of a lot of rock music â€“ it should be cut, cut, cutâ€¦ Donâ€™t even get me started on U2â€™s recent releases.)But those flaws donâ€™t negate some thoughtful and wonderful songwriting, a terrific back-up band and a very creditable sound engineering job.

"This will be more like a paean than a review: of the couple thousand recordings in my collection, Pierre Fournierâ€™s recording of the Bach cello suites is in the very top echelon.  Its consistent excellence and beauty makes it a pleasure every time I listen to it.  I consider it the reference for the Bach suites and, while I certainly havenâ€™t heard every alternative, to me Fournierâ€™s performance is superior to the highly-regarded cycles from Pablo Casals and Janos Starker.Fournierâ€™s interpretation emphasizes rhythmic flexibility, musicality and a relatively light touch.  The deft sense of rhythm allows the music to flow naturally without ever dissipating into blandness.  The Prelude of the 2nd suite is I think particularly fine and reflects Fournierâ€™s many strengths.  He manages to both present flexibly within individual phrases while creating a sense of long-term structure.  This Prelude is built in a wave-like form, with the smaller eddies at times reaching a particular crest.  So the music flows up and down the register and reaches a high F (measure 20) before subsiding, followed by a gradual build up to the higher range in a passage that concludes with an understated but climactic triple stop in the dominant.  Fournierâ€™s performance is affecting and perfectly judged throughout.  The â€œtacticalâ€ phrasing is full of nuance without obscuring structurally-important pitches.Another very fine moment occurs in the concluding Gigue of the 3rd Suite, a dance which shows Fournier is capable of great intensity when he thinks the score calls for it.  This Gigue is relatively light-hearted and Fournierâ€™s style fits it perfectly, allowing it to be light but with a rhythmic fluidity stemming from his always sensitive treatment of the downbeats.  Within this calm and carefree external portion, though, the central section is built over a drone-like D.  Fournier shifts wonderfully from a light, understated approach into playing this central section with passion and a sense of urgency.The Fournier cycle combines rhythmic dexterity with emotional variety.  His technique is assured with no intonation issues anywhere.  The recording, dating from 1960, isnâ€™t modern but it sounds very good.  This is a landmark recording.  I have heard alternative versions of the Suites that have impressed and pleased me greatly, but Fournierâ€™s continues to stand as the exemplar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AVV38Y1PX27D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GRZ#wasThisHelpful","R1AVV38Y1PX27D","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are very strong solo singers appearing here but their efforts can't surmount a generally tepid performance.  The disc contains most of the twenty Latin numbers for various soloists and instruments which Heinrich Schutz grouped together in his Symphoniae Sacrae, Book 1 and published in 1629.  The Symphoniae are strongly influenced by the Venetian style of such greats as Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi and were likely written in the 1610s after Schutz had returned to his native Germany from the life-changing visit to Venice.  A Parisian recording dating from 1985, the disc freatures several solo singers along with the early music group, Les Saqueboutiers de Toulouse.The singing as I mentioned is excellent.  Iâ€™d point to the work of bassist Bernard Fabre-Garrus, who does beautifully in â€œBenedicam Dominumâ€ (track 3) and in perhaps the best single number in this 1st book of Symphoniae, the lament â€œFili mi, Absalomâ€ (track 8).  The performance of â€œFili mi, Absalomâ€ exemplifies this performance, with Fabre-Garrus periodically trying to inject some passion and life into the proceedings, but vanquished in this attempt by the uninspired instrumentalists.  Likewise, one of the tenors (not sure which one â€“ the accompanying materials are not informative â€“ but either John Elwes or Guy de Mey) sings very nicely in the beautiful â€œVeniteâ€ (track 9) but the performance again fails to take flight.  Two of the concluding tracks featuring the trumpets are particularly leaden (â€œAdjuro vosâ€ and â€œInveneruntâ€, tracks 14 and 15, respectively).Iâ€™ve owned this disc for a couple of decades and, despite my love for Schutzâ€™s music, itâ€™s never grabbed me or made me want to listen more to it.

"There are very strong solo singers appearing here but their efforts can't surmount a generally tepid performance.  The disc contains most of the twenty Latin numbers for various soloists and instruments which Heinrich Schutz grouped together in his Symphoniae Sacrae, Book 1 and published in 1629.  The Symphoniae are strongly influenced by the Venetian style of such greats as Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi and were likely written in the 1610s after Schutz had returned to his native Germany from the life-changing visit to Venice.  A Parisian recording dating from 1985, the disc freatures several solo singers along with the early music group, Les Saqueboutiers de Toulouse.The singing as I mentioned is excellent.  Iâ€™d point to the work of bassist Bernard Fabre-Garrus, who does beautifully in â€œBenedicam Dominumâ€ (track 3) and in perhaps the best single number in this 1st book of Symphoniae, the lament â€œFili mi, Absalomâ€ (track 8).  The performance of â€œFili mi, Absalomâ€ exemplifies this performance, with Fabre-Garrus periodically trying to inject some passion and life into the proceedings, but vanquished in this attempt by the uninspired instrumentalists.  Likewise, one of the tenors (not sure which one â€“ the accompanying materials are not informative â€“ but either John Elwes or Guy de Mey) sings very nicely in the beautiful â€œVeniteâ€ (track 9) but the performance again fails to take flight.  Two of the concluding tracks featuring the trumpets are particularly leaden (â€œAdjuro vosâ€ and â€œInveneruntâ€, tracks 14 and 15, respectively).  The technique and polish of all the musicians involved is never in doubt, but their excitement and passion is.Iâ€™ve owned this disc for a couple of decades and, despite my love for Schutzâ€™s music, itâ€™s never grabbed me or made me want to listen more to it.  It is recorded very well, a credit to the Erato engineers who seem to have surmounted the issues facing early digital sooner than some of their competition.

"The â€œLaetatus sumâ€ motet here is so beautiful the set is worth getting for that alone. The motet perfectly displays this performanceâ€™s virtues, the vocal and instrumental timbres carefully deployed to set off the sections and voices.  Often the strands in the polyphonic texture are differentiated with each of the voices set apart by a distinct color.  At other times, the soloists modify their tone color to make them similar and create a unified effect.  For example, at about 2' into the motet, the lower male soloists blend their tone together during a warm passage in the lower register.  Using the bassoon to mark the motetâ€™s â€œwalking bassâ€ may not be original to conductor Philippe Herreweghe but it's used particularly well here, with the instrumentâ€™s sound standing out vibrantly.  Emerging from a blending of older polyphonic thinking melded with baroque concepts, including a harmonic support from the continuo, that were new when Monteverdi wrote the vespers in 1610, this wonderful â€œLaetatus sumâ€ receives an inspired rendition.Overall, this â€œVespersâ€ from Herreweghe and his long-time group La Chapelle Royale along with some affiliated ensembles is the acme of technical accomplishment.  The solo and choral singing is impeccable and at the same time expressive.  As mentioned already, the use of different vocal colors to set off the individual lines in the polyphonic sections is carefully thought-out and brilliantly successful.  The next motet after â€œLaetatus sumâ€ is the duet â€œDuo seraphimâ€ and it also exemplifies this performanceâ€™s success, with beautiful solo singing and a resonant, rich continuo accompaniment.Herreweghe tends to be a more objective, less emotional musician and that has its downside. The tuneful and attractive chorale â€œAve versus corpusâ€ shows the weaknesses of approach. Itâ€™s a bit plodding, and in general this motet and the long, concluding Stabat mater isn't as fine as the concerto-like first section of the Vespers.  Itâ€™s in this first forty minutes that Herreweghe and La Chapelle Royale really shine.The highly successful emphasis on polyphony is helped by audiophile-level sound engineering, which allows each of the voices and instruments to be clearly heard and prevents the chorus, an ensemble that is often just so difficult for recordings to reproduce, from suffering from distortion.  This is the fourth recording of Monteverdiâ€™s Vespers that I have had the pleasure of sampling in recent weeks.  All are very good but I thought it would be helpful to provide a capsule summary of each one:Musica Fiata/Bernius: Heartfelt, emotional, outstanding soloists, mediocre sound.Boston Baroque/Pearlman: Balanced, stress on polychoral spatial effects, weaker soloists, very well recorded and performed choral numbers.Chapelle Royale/Herreweghe: Technically astounding.  Emphasis on polyphony, vocal timbres, audio engineering.Tragicomedia/Stubbs: Smallest forces with tiny chorus.  Strong soloists.

"This 1985 East German recording of selections from Heinrich Schutzâ€™s Symphoniae sacrae, Book 1 has some good moments but overall lacks the polish and consistency we usually hear in Baroque music performances today.  The label prominently displays the involvement of the esteemed tenor Peter Schreier, but he only appears in one selection, â€œVenite ad meâ€ (track 6),  certainly the releaseâ€™s single best number.  I also enjoyed the work of bassist Gunther Schmidt, especially his work in â€œAttenditeâ€ (track 7).  Both Schreier and Schmidt have mellifluous voices and interpret the music with musicality and technical command.But the same canâ€™t be said for all the performers.  I found the work of countertenor Werner Marschall substandard, and his individual number â€œExultavitâ€ (track 3) is shrill and strained.  Tenor Ekkehard Wagner is better but still not at a wholly satisfactory level,  his performance cramped by a nasal tone color.  The three boy tenors featured in â€œVeni dilecte meâ€ (track 5) do nicely.  The instrumental band is technically acceptable but suffers from a conductor, Hans Gruss, who barely exercises any directorial control.  The lack of control is heard in the way voices and instruments often just play along without much tempo flexibility or setting off of foreground and background.  Recorded sound is good.  So this is just an OK performance.A more comprehensive recording of the first book of Symphoniae sacrae by Les Saqueboutiers de Toulouse (on Erato) is listless; while better than this recording, it isnâ€™t wonderful.  Iâ€™ve been listening to a small selection of the first and second books of the Symphoniae Sacrae from the Cappella Augustana led by Matteo Messori (rereleased on Brilliant) which is a much more lively presentation, and I would recommend that as an alternative.  Three stars for this older release under review here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9CGTRNYJOIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001WJI#wasThisHelpful","RH9CGTRNYJOIR","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though Beethovenâ€™s 4th Piano Concerto stands as one of the great pieces ever written, the actual orchestration maybe isn't ideal, with a tendency to muddiness.  I seem to have spent decades listening to flawed performances of this wonderful concerto, many displaying thickness and a lack of clarity in the orchestra, such as in the well-known Leon Fleisher/George Szell release.  (If any readers want to recommend recordings of the 4th they particularly like, I encourage you to leave a comment below.)  With such recurring experiences, I turned to the Arte Nova release led by David Zinman, hoping that Zinmanâ€™s stress on textural clarity might fit well with the 4th concerto.  What I found was a musical interpretation from pianist Yefim Bronfman, a performer whom I think is both excellent and consistent, offset by wayward conducting from David Zinman, who doesnâ€™t really seem to be paying attention much of the time.This is lack of focus in the conducting is apparent throughout the disc but Iâ€™ll point to the Andante con moto from the 4th concerto (track 5) as a particularly disappointing example.  Zinman rushes the marcato octaves in the strings and doesnâ€™t lend them the imposing weight they need, with the breaths between the phrases exchanged by the piano and orchestra sped up to.  Flaws are apparent in some of the faster music as well.  The â€œHungarianâ€ second theme about 1 minute into the 3rd concertoâ€™s opening Allegro con brio (track 1) is almost always stirring but in Zinmanâ€™s hands it is fussy, with the secondary orchestral parts overemphasized at the expense of the musicâ€™s energy.  The performanceâ€™s nature I think is perfectly captured by the famous opening solo piano passage of the 4th concertoâ€™s Allegro moderato: Bronfman provides an expressive opening solo piano passage with the orchestra entering in a neutral disengaged way.This disc isnâ€™t helped by the downright weird sound, a sound also heard in the other Zinman Zurich Tonhalle Beethoven series.  The strings just sound off, like neither the live sound of an orchestra or conventional recorded reproduction of the section.  Zinmanâ€™s uneven and wayward approach is something Iâ€™ve noted before in this series.  His recording of the 1st and 2nd symphonies pairs a scintillating and enjoyable 1st symphony with a stymied, uneven 2nd.  So Bronfmanâ€™s characteristic excellence is offset by disappointing orchestral playing and odd engineering.

"Despite stiff competition from some worthy alternatives, this 1989 release from Frieder Bernius and Musica Fiata has become my favorite version of Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s â€œVespersâ€.  Marked by very fine solo singing, what is most important is the emotion, grandeur and warmth that these musicians bring to this ramshackle, diverse â€œmega-workâ€, recreating it in its full glory.Much of the set is astonishingly beautiful but Iâ€™ll single out certain tracks as particularly noteworthy.  The â€œDuo Seraphimâ€, a concerto-like section springing from secular music of the time, is given just a wonderful performance led by tenors David Cordier, John Elwes, and William Kendall (disc 1, track 7).  Soprano soloists Monique Zanetti and Gillian Fisher combine with countertenor David Cordier in the â€œPulchra esâ€ concerto (disc 1, track 5) provide a fine, harmonious rendition, the trio of singers uniting in a blended sound. These soloists are joined by star bassist Peter Kooy at several points, including a fine â€œQuia fecitâ€ (disc 2 track 6).Bernius approaches the Vespers with reasonably large forces, and a â€œblendedâ€ choral style, the individual sections of the chorus united into a homogenous harmonic sound, an approach I would contrast with that of William Christie and Les Arts Florissants, where the individual lines within the choral textures are emphasized.  The polychoral effects â€“ spatial sensations following from setting the different forces across a physical performance space â€“ are heard but again not stressed.  In this way it is different from the fine recording by Martin Pearlman and Boston Baroque, which focuses on these spatial results.  The work by the instruments adds to the â€œVespers.â€  Bernius restricts the band to strings, horns and continuo, a bit less varied than other recordings, but they provide effective, often joyous accompaniment.  The bandâ€™s work on â€œDeposuit potentesâ€ (disc 2, track 9) is particularly memorable, a sense of entering into paradise projected by the viols and the arpeggiated chords in the continuo.The only real criticism I will make of this â€œVespersâ€ is that the recorded sound is mediocre and weaker than the alternatives.  But the level of the singing and the sheer beauty of this performance make up for it.  This is a must-hear for ancient music fans, the glory of Venice in 1610 brought back to life in a ravishing way.  Warmly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EWJCRSAX9A8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E6EN#wasThisHelpful","R3EWJCRSAX9A8X","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This re-release of a 1955 recording from Nicolai Malko and the Philharmonia Orchestra is noteworthy for a delightful and musical and version of Sergei Prokofievâ€™s 1st Symphony, the â€œClassicalâ€, one of the artistâ€™s best-known compositions.  The 1st brims with life in Malkoâ€™s hands, zesty and full of youth.  Itâ€™s always rewarding to hear playing like this, but unfortunately, the performances of the 7th and two excerpts from the â€œLove for Three Orangesâ€ arenâ€™t at that level.The Malko compares unfavorably to a more recent recording from Mstislav Rostropovich and Lâ€™orchestre National de France (on Erato) which contains both the 1st and 7th symphonies.  This performance also contains a wonderful 1st, fully the equal of Malkoâ€™s version, and a sentimental, often grand rendition of the 7th symphony.  The Rostropovich is comprehensively just plain old better than Malko in the 7th and technically better in the 1st.  Malkoâ€™s 7th is musical and done with the rhythmic flexibility and affection for the music we heard in the 1st, but the Philharmonia is simply not in top form for this session.  The 7thâ€™s opening Allegro â€“ for me, an aging artistâ€™s look backwards at the lost world of the romantic symphony across a chasm of pain and loss â€“ contains a running secondary line in the strings repeated several times throughout.  This line is typically subdued in the overall texture, but Malko chose to emphasize it, a decision which is then undercut by choppy playing from the Philharmonia.  What we have is a perhaps a wrongheaded directorial decision which is in any case executed poorly.  The relative lack of polish in the orchestra is maintained through much of the 7th.  Another instance of this subpar execution comes in the march-like second theme of the Andante espressivo (track 9), which is played choppily.  Malkoâ€™s effort isnâ€™t helped by the recorded sound, which isnâ€™t at all bad for a 1955 recording, but is not up to modern standards.  In contrast, Rostropovichâ€™s 7th is more interpretationally acute, more emotional and meaningful, and also displays superior orchestral execution and sound.  Iâ€™m not  clear why the Malko would be anything but a curiosity item given this competition.  I grew up listening to the 7th in the well-known recording from Gennady Rozhdestvensky and that performance is also more emotional and accomplished than the Malko.As an alternative to the â€œLove for Three Orangesâ€ numbers, I recommend an absolutely outstanding recording from Antal Dorati done with another London orchestra, the LSO (released on Mercury).  So this Malko recording has its attractions and provides a wonderful 1st but it faces some stiff competition and its flaws show as a result.  It stands as a good release but also as a superseded one.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEJ62N4VIE91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000027F5E#wasThisHelpful","R1WEJ62N4VIE91","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The awe-inspiring, shambolic jumble that is Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s Vespers is given a very successful and balanced performance in this 1997 release from Martin Pearlman and his Boston Baroque, one that emphasizes the musicâ€™s polychoral spatial effects.  The set has many high points, absolutely beautiful sections that make the disc highly appealing.The tuneful â€œAve Maria Stellaâ€ is fetching throughout but Pearlmanâ€™s rendition of the forceful concluding choral segment has absolutely grabbed me (end of disc 2, track 2).  Pearlman provides a choral sound that is halfway between the more analytic sound obtained by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants in their Vespers recording and the more blended sound featured in the splendid version from Frieder Bernius and Musica Fiata.  Choral sound is generally difficult to reproduce in recordings so you have to give the Telarc engineers credit for the releaseâ€™s clarity and its general lack of distortion.  Another highlight is the â€œLauda Jerusalemâ€ Psalm (disc 1, track 15), given a stirring, powerful presentation by the Boston Baroque.  This â€œLauda Jerusalemâ€ strikes me as notable as this portion of the Vespers had not in the past made a strong impression.  Not so here.  Capping the first big section of the Vespers, the Lauda will knock you back.  Beautifully done.Pearlman also emphasizes the polychoral nature of Monteverdiâ€™s writing, a trait key to Venetian music from this time.  Polychoral effects rely on positioning musicians in different parts of the performing space and, again partly due to the quality of the engineering, we can clearly hear this â€œsoundstagingâ€ throughout the Vespers.  This is very well heard in the â€œGloria Patri,â€ towards the end of the Magnificat that constitutes the big multi-section finale of the Vespers (disc 2, track 14).  In the â€œGloria Patriâ€, the two male vocalists are located far apart and use the distance to make the repeated melodic lines into an echo effect.  One of the best known parts of the Vespers, the concerto-style â€œDuo seraphimâ€ (disc 1, track 10), also displays the emphasis on spatial effects, with the singers varying their tone colors while located far apart to fully bring out the weaving contrapuntal effects.Any criticism of this excellent set is limited.  Iâ€™d point to solo singing that is weaker than in the alternatives Iâ€™ve sampled â€“ although itâ€™s important to say that these alternatives have notably impressive solo singing, so itâ€™s a high bar to reach.  For example, the â€œNisi Dominusâ€ psalm in the first section (disc 1, track 12) contains some sloppy singing in the faster sections and the solo voices, especially the men, arenâ€™t quite as focused and precise as alternatives.  But that doesnâ€™t mean they arenâ€™t good â€“ just not very good.This is a consistently excellent Vespers that contains portions that are downright great, even perhaps groundbreaking.  Iâ€™d want to own it just for the â€œAve Maria Stellaâ€ and the â€œLauda Jerusalemâ€, but thatâ€™s just part of its attractions.  Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3AMKHVL0R32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003D2F#wasThisHelpful","R2D3AMKHVL0R32","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the 13 Barcarolles on this disc are as always attractive, the high point in this very fine release for me is the concluding Theme and Variations, a more traditional effort that Gabriel Faure wrote in 1895.  Constructed from a simple yet affecting scale-wise melody, Faure adeptly builds a set of ingenious elaborations, often polyphonically-conceived, with variants of the main melody joined to new melodic lines over a bass providing harmonic support.  Germaine Thyssens-Valentin is wonderful in this piece, able to maintain the musicality of each of these complementary melodic lines perfectly while keeping them independent.Thyssens-Valentin also does very well with the 13 Barcarolles, written across the span of his compositional career, the first in 1875 and the thirteenth during his final, dark days in 1921.  She is very musical and succeeds in externalizing the emotions subsumed in Faureâ€™s refined, sophisticated art.  The 6th Barcarolle is a fine example which displays her gifts.  The scales in the final section are played with wonderful delicacy.  She adeptly presents the Barcarolleâ€™s opening theme, a melody that can be either cloying or nondescript in the wrong hands, with rhythmic subtlety and a sense of the musicâ€™s emotional depth.I compared the Thyssens-Valentin with the complete set of Faureâ€™s piano music recorded for Hyperion by UK pianist Kathryn Stott.  This comparison has brought home to me what an achievement Stottâ€™s cycle is.  The two pianists actually take similar approaches to the music, conceiving it as strands of music weaving together more as equal partners than as melody with accompaniment. They both do very fine work but I think Stottâ€™s versions of both the Barcarolles and the Theme & Variations are superior, on several fronts.  Stott presents the music with more atmosphere and emotion than Thyssens-Valentin while also being superior technically.  Compare their 12th Barcarolle: Thyssens-Valentin handles it well, but she doesnâ€™t bring the technical assurance that Stott does.Aside from any comparison with other performers, the flaw in this Thyssens-Valentin recording is to my ears a lack of understanding of Faureâ€™s abstruse late style, a style which begins to be apparent in the 7th Barcarolle (1905), and intensifies into the austere final four, numbers 10 through 13.  While the rest of the disc is very well done, I am critical of the palpable lack of comfort in Thyssens-Valentin playing of the rhythms in these later Barcarolles as well as their emotional flatness. The finest of these late pieces is likely the 11th Barcarolle, from 1913, a severe, gloomy piece that in Stottâ€™s hands is rife with atmosphere and gloom.  This power isnâ€™t heard in Thyssens-Valentinâ€™s version, where it is thick and uncommunicatively abstract.  Finally, while the sound of the Thyssens-Valentin is good for an older recording, Stottâ€™s set holds a decisive edge in that area.The Testament label deserves credit for re-issuing the overlooked but excellent performances from this unfairly neglected Belgian pianist.  My comparison with Stottâ€™s playing, while unfavorable to Thyssens-Valentin, doesnâ€™t mean that the older pianist doesnâ€™t provide a rich, effective presentation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RONCIH2X8WYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005T7J6#wasThisHelpful","R1RONCIH2X8WYG","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The speed which Fischer takes her tempi often makes the contrapuntal lines joining together the harmonic landing points secondary.  The experience of listening to the famous and familiar d-minor Double Violin Concerto in Fischerâ€™s performance is unusual.  The most important part of the band seems to be the continuo, their chords, bass line and harmonic progressions forming the backbone of the work, around which the fast ornamentations of the soloists and orchestra flow as background decoration, a furbello.  Such a shift in emphasis is odd for a composer like Bach, who thought more in terms of horizontal lines than in vertical harmonies.If there is Bach that is more amenable to Fischerâ€™s approach, it would be the two solo violin concerti.  And these violin concerti are in fact more successful than the d-minor concerto and the Violin and Oboe Concerto in c minor.  Sure enough, the Adagio of the 2nd Concerto in E major (track 8) was the highlight of Fischerâ€™s performance, with the tempo not speeded up quite as much as elsewhere in the disc.  The more moderate tempi allows Fischer to relax and she begins to play with a welcome dose of expression.Which takes us to the second problem with this release: the lack of spirit and musicality.  All the performers saw away, very competently and efficiently, at high speed through much of the four concerti.  But this isnâ€™t really an energetic performance; rather, itâ€™s a fast one.  Thereâ€™s a palpable lack of emotion here.  Although Iâ€™ve loved all four concerti for decades, listening to this release turned into a somewhat dispiriting experience.So a fast performance with little expressivity and a limited view of Bachâ€™s compositional philosophy.  It sounds to me like a budget price release from a second-tier set of musicians.  Typewriter Bach. Though this release has been hyped and comes from one of the new generation of international solo stars, itâ€™s unfortunately an insignificant interpretational event.  As this is my first experience with Julia Fischer, Iâ€™m going to listen to her other releases with an open mind but boy is this unpromising.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CYOK1QFKPI2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IT74YW#wasThisHelpful","R3CYOK1QFKPI2Y","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this 2006 recording, David Jalbert emphasizes the melody-and-accompaniment aspect of Gabriel Faureâ€™s 13 Nocturnes, playing musically and with rhythmic fluidity.  Jalbert is an accomplished technician, has command of the Nocturnes and presents with beautiful tone.  He is helped by an outstanding sound engineering job.  While I criticize some of Jalbertâ€™s playing below, I want to emphasize that this is a good and enjoyable recording from a talented musician.When I write that Jalbert emphasizes the Nocturneâ€™s melody-and-accompaniment, it is to contrast his approach with the more polyphonically-inclined interpretations from the two pianists whom I think are the leaders in Faure pianism, Kathryn Stott and Germaine Thyssens-Valentin.  Both Stott and Thyssens-Valentin conceive of the Nocturnes -- and Faureâ€™s other terrific piano music -- as fundamentally polyphonic, in that two or more often three different strands of music intermingle in an accomplished interplay.  The view is fundamentally different from Jalbertâ€™s, who presents a melody in the foreground with subsidiary melodies and harmonies supporting that lead line.  Jalbertâ€™s approach is similar to the older recording of the Nocturnes by Brit pianist Paul Crossley.  Crossley succeeds due to a tremendous rhythmic flexibility and a more assertive, masculine approach to the music.  That said, I think the insight about the musicâ€™s construction from Stott and Thyssens-Valentin greatly enrichens the listening experience.Jalbert also doesnâ€™t consistently bring out the emotion and power of Faureâ€™s writing.  There are some moments that are thoroughly successful.  The 6th Nocturne contains a middle section that begins with a syncopated melody gradually building to a fortissimo climax, which Jalbert brings out with genuine feeling.  After the fortissimo, the Nocturne settles back into a very soft arpeggiated passage, a passage that sublimates the powerful passion of the middle section.  Jalbert unfortunately does this arpeggiated passage in a flat, unemotive way.  I noticed the same thing in the transition back to the reprise of the A section in the 5th Nocturne, a piece which has a similar emotional pattern as the 6th.  The severe, almost enigmatic 11th Nocturne, a somber example from Faureâ€™s later life, is liewise done with a lack of expressivity, a flaw I also detected in the chilling middle section of the 1st Nocturne.  Letâ€™s say that thereâ€™s uneven emotional depth in this playing.These criticisms aside, this is a promising disc from a talented pianist.  My criticisms donâ€™t negate the discâ€™s many positive qualities.  While it falls short of the achievements of older pianists Iâ€™ve mentioned above, Jalbertâ€™s performance is a rewarding one to which I assign 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJV78W6YSFON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EQ472M#wasThisHelpful","RRJV78W6YSFON","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last several months, I have been listening to this cycle of Sergei Prokofiev symphonies recorded by Mstislav Rostropovich and Lâ€™Orchestre Nationale de France and have found it overall a well done and successful set.  Rostropovichâ€™s characteristic conductorial approach involves careful attention to orchestral balances and timbres combined with a relaxed, but not inert, emotional temperature.  This approach has yielded many very good moments across the repertory, and that holds true here.The set contains a wonderful interpretation of the best known of these pieces, the â€œClassicalâ€ 1st symphony (1917), full of feeling and high spirits.  I also have very much enjoyed Rostropovichâ€™s wistful, even yearning take on the 7th symphony (1952), a late work whoâ€™s initial conception as a childrenâ€™s symphony has left in it traces of nostalgia, making for an old artistâ€™s backward glance at the lost world of the romantic symphony.  While I consider the long and ambitious 6th symphony (1947) only a partial success as a composition, Rostropovich delivers a very accomplished and effective rendition, aided by an excellent orchestra.While I already knew these pieces well, this release allowed me to appreciate some of Prokofievâ€™s less famous compositions.  Rostropovichâ€™s interpretation of the long Theme and Variations ending the 2nd symphony opened my eyes to the beauty hidden within a work that has borne the brunt of heavy criticism ever since its unsuccessful 1925 premiere in Paris, criticism originating both from the composer and from listeners.  The key is to get past a first movement so off-putting, angular and plain old ugly that it saps the spirits of listeners before they arrive at the Theme and Variations, a 25-minute long finale that contains some singularly beautiful, unusual inspirations.  The Theme consists of a diatonic oboe melody over rustling strings and clarinets, luscious and hushed.  After this long theme, which takes almost four minutes to present, the variations that follow are often very attractive.  The first begins with an ascending set of scales in the strings, almost three-dimensional in character, culminating in a turning, tired figure high in the flutes.  The orchestration is often stunning, for example in the 5th variation, the shimmering, overlapping ostinati remind me of the first tableau of Igor Stravinskyâ€™s â€œPetrushka.â€  This is a major artistic achievement played beautifully by Rostropovich and the Orchestre.Combined with its excellent sound, these performance high-points lend the set many attractive qualities.  A few issues with the set have caused a downgrade to 4 stars.  The main problem is a baffling version of what is probably Prokofievâ€™s most important symphony, the 5th (from 1944).  Often presented with thick, rich textures as an almost neo-romantic example of Prokofievâ€™s later style, Rostropovich is the perfect conductor to introduce more transparency and diversify the sonic effects in the 5th.  Instead, we have a slipshod, unfocussed rendition.  Sins range from the technical (strings are sloppy with imprecise ensemble) to interpretation (the performing style swings between different approaches within the span of a few minutes).  The symphony seems almost out of control at points.  A Prokofiev cycle with such a 5th is like a well-prepared meal spoiled by a poorly executed main entrÃ©e.I also am mixed about some of the music.  Besides my distaste for the 2nd symphonyâ€™s opening Allegro, the 3rd symphony is only sometimes successful.  The 3rd symphony is played well by Rostropovich and the Orchestre but I recommend you check out the Riccardo Chailly performance with Concertgebouw Amsterdam (on Decca), one that I think is marginally better.  The 4th, which both the original version from 1930 and its overhaul in 1947 included here, is a total miss with the exception of an attractive Scherzo.  After years of trying to appreciate it, I think the lengthy 6th symphony is dutiful rather than inspired.So Mstislav, Sergei and the Orchestre have their very good moments in this 4-CD set but also suffer some setbacks.  If Rostropovich had delivered a 5th he was capable of, this probably would be the reference release for these symphonies.

"Martha Argerich approaches the three JS Bach compositions included here with her characteristic sense of drama and energy.  All three are in a minor key, and all are among Bachâ€™s premier keyboard pieces, so they form a well-chosen set unified by a coherent and often powerful interpretive vision.  There is little playfulness here and little dance and no frivolity at all â€“ this is Bach the Lutheran.The distinctiveness of Argerichâ€™s approach is particularly apparent in the Gavotte of the 3rd English Suite in G minor, which is far more energetic and aggressive than what I am used to from other performances.  Her playing is strong and relentless, with the sparkle of the rolled ornaments that is often brought out by other pianists subdued into a streamlined forward momentum.  My favorite English Suites disc is of numbers 2 and 3 from Ivo Pogorelich (like this one, on DG), which is far more sensuous, generally slower and more sensitive than what Argerich does here.Argerichâ€™s rendition particularly well suits the 2nd Partita in C minor, one of my favorite Bach works.  In the Courante, her energy combines with an austere avoidance of timbral effects.  The dramatic contrast between the soft and melodic, almost plaintive, middle section of the beautiful opening Sinfonia and the aggressive fugue with which it ends shows Argerich setting off sections to highlight the level of drama, but without using much timbral differentiation.  This all culminates in a powerful presentation of the concluding Capriccio, a difficult and to my ears magnificent capstone to this Partita.  Argerich also presents a fine Toccata in c minor, the earliest of the pieces found here.  The Toccataâ€™s central fugue and its related fugal conclusion have sweep and the sort of relentless severity that is a hallmark of this disc.Any criticisms of this disc would apply to the very mediocre sound engineering from DG and, on a more sophisticated level, the way Argerich seems uninterested in Bachâ€™s polyphonic conception of this music.  Even in passages written in two voices, Bach always implies layers of different voices folding into each other.  Argerich flattens this implicit polyphony.  But these weaknesses donâ€™t negate Argerichâ€™s playing.  Monochrome, streamlined, and stern, this recording comes from a master pianist with a cohesive and intense vision of the music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QL186384DVEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004R7X0#wasThisHelpful","R1QL186384DVEX","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last several months, I have been listening to the cycle of Sergei Prokofiev symphonies recorded by Mstislav Rostropovich and Lâ€™Orchestre Nationale de France over the last several months and have found it overall very well done.  Rostropovichâ€™s characteristic conductorial approach involves careful attention to orchestral balances and timbres combined with a relaxed, but certainly not inert, emotional balance.  This approach has yielded many very good moments and it does so again in this moving recording of Prokofievâ€™s late 7th symphony.  But the consistency Iâ€™ve come to expect from these performers falls through, very unexpectedly, in this recording of the 5th symphony.  This is particularly unfortunate as the 5th is probably the composerâ€™s main statement as a symphonist and is a piece I think would have benefitted from successfully applying Rostropovichâ€™s aesthetic.Letâ€™s start with the good.  Beginning its life as a childrenâ€™s symphony, the 7th (1952) is a wistful and nostalgic work, a real throwback to the era of the romantic symphony.  Rostropovich, who is not a heart-on-your-sleeve maestro, veers from his approach for a performance that is full of yearning, sweet, with some wonderful evocations of Prokofievâ€™s timbral effects.  With its well-known main theme, the opening Moderato is tender to the point of pathos; an old man walking in the woods beset by memories of a long-gone era.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I thought the leaping secondary theme in the Moderato was presented brilliantly, helped by this discâ€™s very strong sound engineering.  This approach isnâ€™t for everyone; I was at first put off by Rostropovichâ€™s bordering-on-treacly interpretation, but I warmed to it and then after a time started to be downright moved.The 5th (1944) is a long and ambitious symphony often presented with thick, rich textures, an almost neo-romantic example of Prokofievâ€™s later style, and one that had gone beyond the bristly wit and flashiness of his earlier music.  Rostropovich is the perfect conductor to introduce more transparency and diversify the sonic effects in the 5th, which is after all written by a past master in orchestration.  Instead, we have a sloppy, unfocussed performance.  Sins range from the technical (strings are sloppy with imprecise ensemble) to interpretation (the performing style swings between different approaches within the span of a few minutes).  The performance seems almost out of control at points.  I really wish Rostropovich had asked for a flyer, gone back for a couple of more rehearsals, and done another session.  A Prokofiev cycle with such a 5th is like a well-prepared meal spoiled by a poorly executed main entrÃ©e.Iâ€™m assigning the disc 4 stars, an average of the 5 for the wonderful 7th symphony and 3 for this strangely botched 5th.  This should have been a near-reference recording but ends up worth buying for the 7th only.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRNLGRIKNV4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000005E80#wasThisHelpful","R1VRNLGRIKNV4D","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent recording of JS Bachâ€™s 7 Toccatas from Canadian pianist Angela Hewitt but lack intensity and a sense of drama.  Hewitt could use a vitamin injection.  I listened to the disc, found it satisfactory but unexceptional and then was taken aback by the praise the press had heaped on her Bach series, and so I would class this release in the overrated category.  The Toccatas, which I think are attractive and fine pieces, date from earlier in the authorâ€™s career, all of them written before Bach turned 30 in 1715, and as early works they have received relatively few recordings over the years.  So Hewitt is one of the few on offer.The strengths and weaknesses of Hewittâ€™s interpretation can be heard clearly in the E minor Toccata (track 4, BWV 914).  The Toccatas are constructed from alternating episodes, made up of fugues, meditative slow passages that serve as contrasting sections, sometimes in the proud â€œFrench Overtureâ€ style, and virtuous passages built from flourishes showing off the performerâ€™s technique.  The E minor Toccata characteristically ends with a fugue constructed of running sixteenth notes, a section that is instantly recognizable as Bach.  Hewitt plays this fugue with some panache.  But the rest of the Toccata, such as the severe opening, tied thematically to the concluding fugue, is undernourished. The meditative Adagio that occurs a bit later in the piece is presented in a restrained, even dull fashion.I compared Hewittâ€™s performance of the best known of the Toccatas, in C minor (track 1, BWV 911) with Martha Argerichâ€™s on DG.  Argerich presents a dramatic and sweeping version, with her characteristic brand of intensity.  In contrast, Hewitt is a bit listless, selecting tempi that are considerably slower.  Hewitt chooses to take the beautiful central fugue, built out of the C minor triad, slowly at the beginning, a long-standing and successful strategy in playing Bachâ€™s more severe fugues.  So far so good, but that strategy usually involves a gradual build-up in intensity as the textures and re-introduction of the main subject become more complex.  Hewitt doesnâ€™t achieve such an increase in intensity, both here and in the related concluding fugue.  The superiority of Argerichâ€™s exciting and involved interpretation I think is pretty obvious.The disc isnâ€™t helped by what I consider a regrettable performance of the D major Toccata (BWV 912).  The sloppy execution here indicates that Hewitt and the producers should have bit the bullet and done another few takes.  This Toccata is tucked in at the end of the disc as track 7, which isnâ€™t called for by the work sequence number and indicates that the producers knew full well they were releasing a substandard track and wanted to hide it in the back.Sound engineering is very good.  Despite this, I am rating this 3 stars both because of the hum-drum nature of Hewittâ€™s playing found here and an unsatisfactory D major Toccata.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ03A1WS2X7LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000069CVA#wasThisHelpful","RJ03A1WS2X7LD","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thereâ€™s something prelapsarian about Gabriel Faureâ€™s earlier music.  Springing from a world of sophistication and urbanity, it is at times sad but seems completely unthreatened by disaster.  Faureâ€™s later years were marred by the war and by personal devastation, but the first seven Nocturnes written in the earlier part of his life between 1875 and 1898 and presented here by UK pianist Paul Crossley, come from an era where any more minor personal misfortunes appear against a background of beauty and placid delight.  These seven Nocturnes contain some very fine example of the composerâ€™s piano efforts, including the memorable 4th with its well-known falling fourths theme and the 1st Nocturne, with its high bell-like opening melody segueing into the dark and moody lower central section melody.  This is very fine music presented successfully by Crossley.Extroverted and masculine, Crossleyâ€™s combines these characteristics with a great degree of rhythmical flexibility and an emphasis on the foreground melodies.  Faureâ€™s piano music is typically texturally rich, which several complex streams of music joined together.  I compared Crossleyâ€™s playing with the terrific set of nocturnes from another British pianist, Kathryn Stott (in her cycle on the Hyperion label) and found the contrast revealing.  Stott emphasizes the polyphony and texture, with the foreground melody more integrated into the complex accompaniment.  Her sound also pushes Faure closer to the impressionist and post-romantic composers from circa 1900.  Crossley, focused on the main melody, presents a Faure that sounds much more traditionally romantic and mid-century.Crossleyâ€™s approach brought a new perspective to the music for me.  The wonderful 2nd Nocturne, which is often presented so peacefully, has a new sense of forward momentum and energy in his hands.  He gives us a thought-provoking 6th Nocturne, a critically-esteemed work, with a wonderful interpretation that builds to a powerful climax in the final section.  This is not placid Faure.  There are some undersides to Crossleyâ€™s approach: the 4th Nocturneâ€™s middle section is a bit plodding and lacks the rhythmic fluidity of the rest of the disc.  But most of the disc sustains that balance of energy and rhythmic fluidity to realize Crossleyâ€™s cohesive vision of these Nocturnes.This is a 1983 recording using analog technology with only decent sound.  But Crossleyâ€™s gifts and thought make this a worthwhile and interesting Faure release.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQ8RKRZHMB6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001JZYPQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UQ8RKRZHMB6X","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This outstanding performance would be a clear reference in most of the classical repertory.  But due to the incredibly strong field of JS Bach solo cello suites recordings, Bailey's 2010 effort is only one of several excellent traversals.  Baileyâ€™s approach emphasizes the instrumentâ€™s rich and deep sound combined with a masculine interpretation matched with musicality.Bailey's virtues are exemplified in the long and ambitious Prelude to the 5th Suite, a very beautiful instance of Bachâ€™s art constructed in typical slow-fast fugato form.  The slow introduction, filled with dotted rhythms, is done with strength and grace. In the long faster section, where Bach mimics a fugue in only one voice, Bailey uses his lower register to contrast the lower sections with the polyphonically-conceived passages in the treble.  Baileyâ€™s approach is in this way used to bring out one of the Preludeâ€™s latent features, which for me is always the sign of a high-level interpretation.  This is one of many high points in this consistently excellent set of performances.  I also very much enjoyed individual movements like the 4th suiteâ€™s Bourree or the Minuet II from the 1st suite, but other listeners will have their own preferences.  I canâ€™t cite an individual dance or prelude that I thought was weak.  If I have to isolate any flaws, Iâ€™d point to occasional glitches in the articulation of notes but they are infrequent and are a quibble.  Bailey is generally very strong technically, is musical and has a point of view through which he approaches the Suites.For me, Pierre Fournierâ€™s set of Bach suites from 1960 is one of the high points in classical music performance.  Whatâ€™s interesting â€“ and what sets Baileyâ€™s achievement in context â€“ is the slim difference in quality between his recording and Fournierâ€™s.  The two have quite different approaches -- Fournier builds his around rhythmic flexibility and a sense of improvisation, Bailey around the celloâ€™s sound and the musicâ€™s majesty â€“ but in terms of quality, they are close.  Baileyâ€™s interpretation strikes me as a superior version of Heinrich Schiffâ€™s very good set of suites done in the early 1980s (on EMI).Given Baileyâ€™s interpretational angle, he has been fortuitously blessed with an audiophile level engineering job from Telarc.  This 2-CD set has been very enjoyable to get to know I and I strongly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCXX7X37RE3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030GBSVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VCXX7X37RE3J","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This release in Vasily Petrenkoâ€™s series of Dmitri Shostakovich symphonies is coming in for some criticism from Amazon reviewers and I want to state upfront that the criticism, while I do agree with some of the specific points, is unbalanced and ignores this releaseâ€™s many strengths.  Iâ€™ll instead emphasize that the glass is three-quarters full rather than one-quarter empty.I am in the minority as someone who prefers the 9th symphony to the more famous 5th.  The 9th is one of those compositions that belie any easy connection between biography and musical content.  Completed in 1945, in a country where a third of the population had been killed off in the terror and the German invasion, it is a deft, graceful, even happy work.  Before hearing the Petrenko rendition, my preferred performance was the old Brit one from Malcolm Sargent (on Everest).  Characteristically, Petrenko takes an energetic, aggressive approach overall, one that is musical, exciting and vivid.  After direct comparison with the Sargent, I have a marginal preference for Petrenkoâ€™s.  I want to point especially to a sensitive and inspired performance of the finale, a track which is tucked in at the end of this long disc, and so needs to be highlighted as special.  The 9th by itself justifies this release.Then we have the 5th symphony (1937). If the 9th speaks of an almost bizarre happiness rising from the ashes, the 5th has come to serve as the musical emblem of Stalinâ€™s terror, an almost mythic piece that defies criticism.  (Sooner criticize the stars.)  But Iâ€™ll venture a critical comment anyway: the finale, where Petrenko has been criticized, is not the symphonyâ€™s best moment.  I very much like Shostakovichâ€™s march-like passages â€“ and appreciate their extramusical significance â€“ but this finale has over the years worn on me as somewhat clichÃ©d.  For me, the long opening Allegro and the lovely Largo are the core of the 5th.  Petrenko has an integrated, cohesive approach to these two movements.  Under his baton, they are mysterious, soft and sensuous.  The high opening violin melody of the Allegro is stunningly beautiful and the Largo is rich and full of emotion and different sounds.  The Largo is a striking performance.  Petrenko' still and quiet approach serves to emphasize the desolation in its flute and harp sections. .So what if the finale slows down a bit too early.  This is an unusual 5th, but terrific musicians like Petrenko think for themselves and envision music in new ways.  Petrenkoâ€™s 5th is such a performance: nonconformist, with new things to say, and at times rivetingly beautiful.The playing of the Royal Liverpool orchestra is generally very good although not perfect.  I have been very impressed with the sound engineering of the other Naxos releases from Petrenko and, while this one could be a tad more refined, still like it a lot.  Strongly recommended for a reference-standard 9th and a highly original 5th.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKFO5GOLWJQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002N5KEF6#wasThisHelpful","R1XKFO5GOLWJQJ","A1TPKBOBV0O84Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TPKBOBV0O84Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, I was skeptical due to all the phony sounding 5-star reviews and I also discount those who receive a special deal in exchange for a review. But I recently had an outstanding customer service experience with Anker. So I didn't hesitate to buy this product...at full price!My husband hates selfie sticks, but I bought this one anyway so I could be in some of our travel photos! It worked great with iPhone 6 Plus and everyone in our travel group was planning to go home and buy one for themselves and for gifts. I never worried about the security of my expensive iPhone, but I do have to re-glue the rubber piece that holds the bottom of the phone, so I deducted a star for that (thankfully I had duct tape with me for a quick repair while on the trip). Simple to set up, pair, and recharge. Bluetooth worked flawlessly, but you do have to reconnect after turning off the stick. It's surprisingly lightweight and folds up small to fit easily in the outside (water bottle) pocket of my camera bag. This is a very high quality product at a very fair price. You won't be disappointed!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14DKPHRSU2B2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOYJ6Q2#wasThisHelpful","R14DKPHRSU2B2N","A11IXJ8M1JO296","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11IXJ8M1JO296?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought 5 of these crewnecks to wear under sweaters on an October trip to Europe. They are soft and very lightweight for layering. Quick drying overnight when hand washed and hung to dry. They're nice enough to wear alone but the cream is a bit too sheer. Gray and Black are opaque. I normally wear a small in tops (5'3"", 120#), but bought medium in these and they are a little big, but better than too tight.

"I'm so happy I decided to spend more money than I'd planned for a really good camera bag. On a recent trip to Central Europe I felt totally secure in crowds. All the compartments are easy to access and lock. It fits my camera Sony A7II with attached zoom lens and bulky Pacsafe camera strap, cards, and extra battery. And I still have room left over for personal items I need for sightseeing. The quality is excellent, well padded and yet not too heavy for a petite woman. The pockets came in handy for water, umbrella or selfie stick. I never got tired of the shoulder strap worn cross-body. A non-obvious feature that I really liked is that the bag can serve as a resting platform when you have your camera out and hanging around your neck, taking some of the weight off your neck and shoulders. I highly recommend this bag - you won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31C9HB7MUFQU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC752Z6#wasThisHelpful","R31C9HB7MUFQU5","A11IXJ8M1JO296","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11IXJ8M1JO296?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They come out looking like new, like they've been dry cleaned, and not creased or wrinkled. I did similar colors together, but the colors that looked like they might run were done individually. The loss of a star is due to the heavy fragrance. I don't know how anyone would want to wear a garment right out of the dryer. The scent filled my house, just like Dryel.

It is also a MP3 player and phone Speaker along with a LED Night Light.The sound comes out crystal clear. It comes with a usb cord and adaptor to plug in along with a cord to plug into the headphone spot on your phone to play music or hook it up to your tv. It also runs on 4 double a batteries which are not included this is so you don't need the USB plug.The base is white with a clear top so the LED colors reflect. It has 3 buttons in the front the middle one is the power and the other 2 are to change the colors. If you have the music turned on the 2 end ones become the volume control and to change the song.This would be good for parties or just to chill around. The darker the room the better the colors of the waves look.I am very pleased with my wave projector. It helps with my anxiety and makes me feel relaxed. I feel like I'm in a whole new world.

By combining polyester and spandex with wool, the company made their wool socks more durable than others on the market, and they don't have that stiff fit or itchy feel common with other wool socks.I love the feel of these socks on my feet, these are perfect they are lightweight but keep your feet warm at the same time. I like to wear these socks with skinny jeans or leggins and with either boots or timberlands. They even look cute with snow boots.The 5 pack of socks come lined up in plastic that is heat sealed. These socks are highly recommend, the price is right and since the holidays are approaching give them as part of a gift.These wool socks also wash nicely and won't stretch out.

"I have tried a few different brands of 3d fiber lash mascara. This infinity 3d fiber lash is number 1 on my list. In my opinion I like it better than the yonique brand.The Infinity 3D Fiber Lashes mascara contains all-natural green tea fibers for lashes that go on and on. Plus, high-potency beeswax which stimulates lash growth and cell regeneration which in overall terms you see healthier lashes with each wear.I use this everyday and it is easy to apply.There are 2 tubes one is the fibers ane the other is the transplant gel (holds fibers in place) and they come in a nice case that is compact and fits right into your makeup bag or purse. The inside of the case is made of like a satin material.I apply the 3d mascara different than some people and realized a big difference compared to the normal application.-First I always start off with a mascara primer (make sure to prime the lashes evenly) on the top and bottom-then I take a volumizing mascara and use it as my base coat-next is where the 3d lashes come into play and you need to play close attention when applying. You need to have both the transplant gel and fibers open at the same time. First take the transplant and apply it as you would like regular mascara (make sure it is even on all lashes) then evenly apply the fibers followed by the transplant gel to lock the fibers in place.-repeat as many times as you want to get the dramatic lashes you like. I usually repeat 2-3 sometimes 4 times. But if you don't want the bold dramatic look apply 2 times.-finally take the eyelash comb and comb the lashes to make the lashes evenly spaced.I experienced no flaking or clumping like I did with some of the other fiber mascaras, and don't have fibers everywhere on my face.I usually try to apply the mascara first before the shadow for a few reasons. The main reason is your bound to get. Mascara on your lid, so what I do is have a qtip dipped in makeup remover to remove the unwanted mascara. 2nd reason you don't want to mess up the blending of your shadow.The Infinity 3D Difference compared to other mascaras isâ€¢ High-quality natural ingredients with beeswax & green tea fibersâ€¢ Safe to wear with contact lens & sensitive eyesâ€¢ Water-resistant, yet easy to remove with soap & water (won't have your mascara running down your face from tears or rain.)â€¢ Flake-free and Hypoallergenicâ€¢ Non-toxic, Paraben and SLS freeâ€¢ Environmentally friendly packagingâ€¢Truly Natural & Truly Easy to Apply within 3 minsI had received many compliments on my eye makeup,  especially my lashes. I had people ask me if I wear falsies, and I tell them no. I leave them in amazement when I tell them that I used 3d fiber mascara.I highly recommend this 3d infinity fiber lash mascara to makeup artist or even if you do your own makeup or a beginner. It is reasonably priced. It will also make a good gift for any makeup addict.Disclaimer I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWAVUE3UO1X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012F232DC#wasThisHelpful","R1TWAVUE3UO1X3","AD4CSVCUMWQOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4CSVCUMWQOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a fan of Foxbrim's facial products for quite some time now. I haven't had a reaction to any of their products that I own being I have dry, flakey, sensitive skin.I was happy to get the lavender mist facial toner. It is 100% all natural ingredients, contains no alcohol or any other unwanted additives.The smell of the lavender isn't strong at all. It feels good when I spray it on my face after I cleanse morning and night. In the morning it makes me feel awake and at night it makes me relaxed.

"I love all the hot tools from xtava. So far I own all of them, and out of their flat irons this is one of my favorites. It has a nice silver and shiney black color on the outside with silver plates. It is great for getting hair straight as well as curling. I used this flat iron to curl and the curls came out flawless and bouncy. When straighten my hair I only need to do each section twice not 3 or 4 times like with other flat irons. After using this iron my hair will stay straight for atleast 48 hours.I always use some sort of heat protection and frizz control before I use the iron. It takes the flat iron less than 2 mins to heat up to the desired temperature.Another plus about this that is different than most flat irons is the safety feature. It will shut off after a minute of not using it. So if you walk away without turning it off , it will go into safety mode.Higher the heat goes the hair gets silkier, shinier and softer. The Xtava Silk Edition Hair Straightener can reach professional-level temperatures of up to 430F and utilizes highly efficient infrared heat to seal in moisture and provide the longest lasting sleekness.This cutting-edge heat technology prevents hair follicle damage, protects color, and delivers results 60% faster than the average flat iron.It includes a LCD screen that reads the temp to know where you have it set at.It comes with a heat resistant bag with a zipper so once you are done you can stick it back into the bag. It is also made for easy storage.I has a 360 swivel on a 9ft cord to allow you distance and the wire won't get tangled.  Which is a good thing because I always seem to get the wire tangled.There is many different hair styles you can do with a flat iron. Just use your imagination. I even use it to apply heat over my braids, and after I take the braid out I got a crimp wavy look.I highly recommend this flat iron as it is reasonably priced, and its just like what stylist use in the salons. You won't be dissapointed, in this flat iron.Disclaimer I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBEINM56XLSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPEH50K#wasThisHelpful","R2IBEINM56XLSW","AD4CSVCUMWQOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4CSVCUMWQOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say I am obsessed with this 4pc zebra diaperbag for a few reasons.1. I love zebra print2. It has a big bag and a small bag, bottle holder and changing mat.3. It has a lot of different size pockets and compartments which makes the bags really Roomy to keep organized.4.made of pvc material which is easy to handwash.For the mesurmentsThe Big one: 15.74""*12.2""*4.72""The Small one: 12.2""*9.44""*3.54""Mat: 23.62""*15.35""Bottle bag: 8.66""*3.54""The small bag can be used for a small day trip or if just running to the store and don't feel like using the big one. It can also be used for the babies necessities such as powder, diapers, wipes, spare bottles/sippy cups, and other things that you would need. It has 2 front zipper pockets and 2 side pockets.Also another good thing with the small bag is I can use it to carry my makeup and hair stuff in if I needed to.The big bag has many compartments inside and out as well. It is a bigger version of the small bag. I can fit all the necessities in there along with outfits, pajamas, and some binks, also some toys.This big bag is also big enough to pack for a weekend getaway besides the everyday use.I actually used the set for myself last weekend when I went away for 2 days and it fit my stuff in it perfect. I used the mat to lay out my necessities that I had in the small bag.The bottle holder I am able to fit atleast 2 4oz bottles or 2 8oz bottles without being squished together.When using this bags I don't need to carry my handbag because I am able to put my phone, wallet, and keys inside of the front zipper pockets.The brown and tan zebra print colors are nice and bold to give the bags a pop and stand out.I know this set will last me a longtime with proper care.The straps of the bags are adjustable to fit around the stroller when going out so no need to carry while pushing.I always get asked where I got this set from because of not seeing it in the stores, also I love the compliments that I get on my set.I highly recommend this set as the colors are neutral as it can be used for babyboy or babygirl.

"I have one word to describe this arctic gel contour memory foam pillow from viscosoft which would be AMAZING .I had used this pillow the first day I received it which was yesterday and it was the best night sleep I had in ages. It kept my head cool, upper back, neck and shoulders pain free. It also helped with my migraine. I didn't wake up once during the night to adjust any pillows. I woke up feeling refreshed.This pillow Uses waveFlow Gel technology, coolness is circulated evenly around the pillow, preventing overheating. The molded memory foam provides support by adapting to the contours of your head and neck.I also like how it came with a zipper case to Protect the pillow and cooling gel. The pillow stayed cool throughout the night into the morning even with how hot I get.Before this pillow I would always be tossing and turning having a restless night sleep, waking up like 5 times to fix my pillows, head sweating, and back and neck hurting by the morning.I highly recommend this pillow the money will be  well spent and you won't regret buying this.Disclaimer ; I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJ6HODO2ENR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKZV8IA#wasThisHelpful","RVJ6HODO2ENR","AD4CSVCUMWQOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4CSVCUMWQOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This diparbag from landuo is very spacious. To me it looks like a big purse, and that's what I decided to use it as since I love big bags.I like how it has the 2 outside side pockets as well as multiple inside pockets. It is a nice black color so it can be used for a boy or girl and dad don't have to feel weird carrying the bag.The material is soft and has leather type handles with metal hooks which are very durable. It is easy to clean, all you need is a wipe to clean it off.While I was using this as a purse I received many compliments, people asked where I got it from and when I told them amazon under diparbags I had them in shock.

"I just have to say this cleanser is a miracle cleanser. It helps clear up acne, acne damaged skin, shrink pores, help diminish dark spots, and whitening of the skin. I also tried a little bit while shaving my legs to see if it made a difference, and it sure did. My legs where baby smooth.I have been using this for almost 2 weeks and my face is completely clear. I usually have breakouts around my monthly and I didn't this month. My skin tone is evening out and pores are shrinking. I use it in the morning and before I go to bed.I haven't used a cleanser that worked this good. I always struggled with acne since I was a young teenager until now into my 30s. It dosent leave my face feeling greasy, or leave a film like feeling. It leaves my face feeling refreshed. I have dry flakey skin especially by my eyebrows and hairline and oily tzone area. Since using I haven't had those issues. I also like the fact I can shave with it to and not have to worry about razor bumps. I mix a few drops in with my shaving gel and massage into my skin. It also last longer, so I only have to shave every 2-3 days instead of every other day.I recieve many compliments on how flawless and glowing my face looks. I am also able to apply my daily makeup routine after I moisturize.  This cleanser gives me smoothnesses to apply my makeup.This really has made me gain my self-esteem and confidence back. I thinking I was going to deal with my acne face forever. But my worries about that are over.This cleanser comes in a 7oz bottle which will last me a while because all you need is a few drops as it is in liquid form.I highly recommend this product if your looking for a glowing flawless face.Disclaimer : I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25SU7CVZCBNFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJKRJ1G#wasThisHelpful","R25SU7CVZCBNFP","AD4CSVCUMWQOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4CSVCUMWQOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am the person who does not like plain water. So having this infuser bottle helped me by allowing me to add different kinds of fruit such as strawberry, kiwi, mango, cantaloupe, lemon, lime, even cucumber also I can add mint leaves, etc.Using this infuser is bpa free and you get all the natural flavors without the added preservatives from bottled water. Another benefit of this bottle is that you put the fruit in the bottle with the water and it filters through the infuser.You don't have to just fill it with water ,you can even fill it with iced tea and still use the fruit ,which is also very delicious.The bottle is easy to clean and is also dishwasher safe. It is easy to store away when not in use. The bottom of the bottle is designed to fit into the cup holder of your car,and baby stroller. It is very durable and will be sure to last a long time.I highly recommend this infuser water bottle as it has many benifits that differ from the other bottles, the price is reasonable, and shipping was on time.I have many infuser bottles and this one is the only one that you don't put the fruit in the netted piece.

"I've been wearing Vionics for years since developing plantar fasciitis.  I own several pairs.  I've never found a better brand for superior arch support and comfort.  If my plantar fasciitis flares up, all I have to do is walk around in a pair of Vionics, and the pain is gone within seconds.  I'm not kidding.THIS particular shoe, however, is NOT comfortable.  As another reviewer noted, the cut out is too tight at the base of the toes which results in pain and a blister.  Also, the little raised round thingies on the foot-bed rub the balls of my feet when I walk.  I'll probably get used to all this when I break them in, but in the meantime, they hurt!One of the shoes appears to have been worn before.  There's a perspiration or oil stain on the left shoe foot-bed.  (Ewww!)Finally (although less importantly) they are big and clunky-looking.  Granted, I realize my sexy shoe days are over, but do orthotic shoes really need to be so ugly?  When I wore them for the first time, my husband said, ""You're not going out in public in those things, are you?""  LOL.Unfortunately, I can't return them.  The seller wants me to pay for the return shipping (approx. $18!), a 20% restocking fee, plus a possible additional 20% if they can't sell the shoe.  My fault for not having bought them directly from Amazon rather than an Amazon vendor.  Still sucks though.I think it's time for me to find another orthotic shoe brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQXIJVL8GD06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQHPAZQ#wasThisHelpful","RKQXIJVL8GD06","A12ZI9PVPM278F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ZI9PVPM278F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had limited exposure to Susan Mallery's books (I read one or two of her Fool's Gold series, which didn't inspire me to read more). However, I decided to start fresh and to give this offering in a new series a chance - I am glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Girls of Mischief Bay"" and look forward to the next installment.The Girls are three friends spanning three decades of life: Nicole is 30, Shannon is about to turn 40, and Pam is facing 50.  Each women is addressing the unique issues of her particular period in life, including love, loss, relationships, parenthood and career.  What they have in common is, that despite their outward success, each has an underlying insecurity that colors her view of herself and her decision-making in the face of inevitable change.  As each one addresses her individual challenges, there is a deep, abiding friendship between the women that buoys them up and sustains them despite their different life stages. The caring relationships between the three characters draw out each one's strength and talents.Mallery has crafted a wonderful introduction to this new series.  The characters are likeable, engaging and realistic; the storyline is well-crafted and highlights the emotional challenges most women face.  I look forward to experiencing how these women evolve in coming books.  Which brings me to my one complaint about the novel: labeling these women of such depth and complexity as ""Girls"" in the title belies the real value of the novel.  If it is true that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, then one should also not judge this book by its title.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BAUXB40Y0XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317749#wasThisHelpful","R15BAUXB40Y0XB","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried several Fiber One products and found them to be edible, sometimes even tasty. This was not one of those products.The first thing I noticed when I tore open the package is the aroma of ""fake strawberry."" I ordered these because they promised real fruit but the smell is the first clue that ""real fruit"" is far down the list of ingredients and probably used in trace amounts to call it such. I took a tentative bite and found that the pastry itself is reminiscent of cardboard and is not streusel-like at all. The strawberry schmear on the pastry tastes a lot like a certain cheap toaster pastry filling that no grown up palate should tolerate.Fiber One has much better products out there (their brownies are actually pretty good!). I think I could eat this if I was starving and there was nothing else at all in the house but I will not be a repeat purchaser of this product. If you loathe fake strawberry taste, this is definitely not for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1TFN47KKF79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRFKUYY#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1TFN47KKF79","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have enjoyed all of the books in the Thunder Point series, but One Wish is not Robyn Carr's best work.The storyline focuses on the developing relationship between Grace Dillon, the owner of the local flower shop, and Troy Headly, a dedicated high school teacher who loves extreme sports and adventures.  Unbeknownst to the town, Grace has left behind a stellar past as an Olympic Gold medalist figure skater to create a new life for herself away from the ruthless competition of professional sports and the pressures of her demanding mother.  At first she and Headly are determined to focus on fun to keep the relationship free of long-term expectations: in other words, friends with benefits.  Predictably they fall in love in spite of their intentions and reach a crisis point when ""complications"" arise in Grace's life.While I found the characters likeable, I thought the storyline too predictable and the dialogue was often stilted and formal.  For example, when Grace reveals that she is a virgin before their first love making, Troy's response seems too stiff and ""canned"" - more a proclamation than true communication about intimacy. The resolution of the challenges in their relationship also seemed overly simplified and abrupt.I recommend the book for those who have been following the series, but if this is your first exposure to Carr's work, you may be left with the wrong impression of her talent.  She has a wonderful ability to create believable characters, weaving together the lives of members of a small community in a remarkably entertaining way.  This book is just not the best representation of that talent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23548KCDQMI16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317722#wasThisHelpful","R23548KCDQMI16","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read all these stories and I find them quite wonderful. If you are unfamiliar, the book centers around three main characters: Seymour Hope, his adoptive father Ignatius P. Grumply and his adoptive mother, who is a ghost, Olive C. Spence. Together the group publishes a story, written in chunks and sent to their readers via mail (you know, those envelopes brought by those nice men and women in blue shorts with eagles on their trucks!). Their story is wildly popular and the trio clamors to meet deadlines and reader demand in every book.In this particular story, Mr. Grumply, simply known as Iggy to Seymour and Cemetery Road readers, learns that his uncle has passed away and left his Scottish castle to Seymour. Seymour and Olive take a trip to Scotland to see the property and decide what to do with it and Iggy remains in Ghastly, Illinois (the setting of the six prior books) because he holds his uncle in disregard for something that happened a long time ago. The uncle, however, takes up residence with Iggy after his passing, in ghost form of course!Hilarity ensues as a creepy developer tries to buy Seymour's castle and turn it into Loch Vegas. He winds up stealing a $10,000 turtle, Mr. Poe, from Seymour and in attempt to rescue this turtle, people believe that the Loch Ness Monster, Nessie, actually exists and sightings abound!All these books are very cleverly written with charming characters and engaging plot lines. The stories are quite short and are suitable for bedtime reading as even though they are marketed as ghost stories, there is little that is scary about them. I was saddened to read that this is the ""last installment"" according to the description but fear not because the book leaves the reader hopeful that we have not seen the last of our favorite Cemetery Road writers!I highly recommend this endearing story and the other six books to one and all. I do hope there are more to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R350MS3AWHM6WC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544313372#wasThisHelpful","R350MS3AWHM6WC","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katherine Center has written an engaging and thought-provoking novel related to how attitude shapes perception and experience â€“ all cloaked in a highly readable novel.Helen Carpenter is the thirty-something protagonist desiring to reinvent herself following a year of post-divorce doldrums. Having let her infinitely annoying, younger brother talk her into a three week wilderness survival course, Helen discovers, much to her dismay, that her brotherâ€™s best friend has also signed up.The survival course is everything advertised and more, with emphasis on survival.  This is not a course for beginners despite Helenâ€™s lack of any experience in outdoor living.  Discovering that she is the oldest member of the group by at least a decade, Helen starts out feeling isolated and alienated from the other survivalists.  She soon discovers that it is her own attitude that is contributing to this rift and over the course of the trek learns to set aside her judgments and biases to really connect and develop relationships.  One of the young women is a psychology major who introduces Helen to the tenets of positive psychology which lays the foundation for creating happiness through gratitude.  By the end of the course, Helen has achieved her goal to begin to rebuild her life.I enjoyed this book on two levels â€“ one, it is good storytelling and two, it challenged me to think about my own relationships in a different light.  I recommend it as an enjoyable and fairly fast read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24N2A4I1CEWET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047307#wasThisHelpful","R24N2A4I1CEWET","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The opening chapter introduces us to Leigh Ann Henion,  a part-time teacher and free-lance writer, who has just become a mother.  Anyone who has survived that first year with a newborn knows it is full of incredible challenges.  However, the back cover notes describe her as ""shocked at the adversity a young mother faces with a newborn,"" which seems overly dramatic and sets a tone for the whole book.I found the book disappointing on several levels.  First, the writing style does not inspire awe and wonder as Henion describes her experiences.  Fortunately, each chapter is a self-contained adventure, which allows the reader to set the book aside and come back to it without much disruption.  Unfortunately, I had difficulty even getting through one chapter without putting the book down.  There are a few engaging passages, but most of the writing is overly descriptive of things that don't matter and sadly falls flat - lacking in any real emotional or spiritual depth. Elizabeth Gilbert (Eat, Pray, Love) contributed a cover quote; however, if you liked her work I believe you will find Henion's offering missed the mark.My second objection has to do with the motherhood issues.  I understand that there are many ways to parent and that what works for one person would be a disaster for another parent/child relationship.  Given that, I felt uncomfortable with the author's justifications for her choices.  It felt as if she was dealing with her own guilt by defending her lifestyle in every chapter.I can't recommend this book either as a inspiring spiritual quest or as a travelogue.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GXJX7O2ZBDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204713#wasThisHelpful","R17GXJX7O2ZBDA","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maxine Revere is an independently wealthy, investigative reporter with her own monthly cable true crime show, ""Maximum Exposure.""  While her dedication to truth has gained her respect, her lack of interpersonal skills has left her personal and professional lives littered with people who resent her methods.  Her wealth allows her pick and choose the cases she takes on and unresolved issues from her past drive her to find answers to cold cases of missing persons.This is the third book featuring Maxine and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well as the preceding works (Maximum Exposure and Notorious).  In Compulsion, Maxine scores an interview with a serial killer prior to the beginning of his trial for five murders.  Previously she had looked into the disappearance of a middle-aged couple on behalf of their three adult children without much success.  Now there seems to be a connection between the missing couple and these five murders.  Following her intuition, Maxine deepens her investigation, much to the dismay of the district attorney and the producer of her show.  The story unfolds with many twists and turns, including putting Maxine's own life at risk, before the facts come to light.The story is well-crafted and the characters are engaging.

"This was a great story, reminiscent of one of my favorite books ever, Inkheart. The story starts with our young protagonist, Billy Gilfoyle, who is doomed to spend his summer in a cabin with no TV. His mother is working on her dissertation about parallel universes all the time and Billy has nothing but the library of the cabin's owner, Dr. Libris, to entertain him.Upon solving the riddle of the locked cabinet in the library, Billy pulls out a book about Hercules and suddenly realizes what is transpiring on the page is actually happening on the island in the middle of the lake near the cabin. He dismisses the realism of the situation and opens another book about Robin Hood with near the same result.The next day Billy travels to the island and find out that the characters he thought he was imagining on the island are actually on the island! He gets to meet Hercules and Robin Hood and becomes known as ""Sir William of Goat"" after describing himself like the Billy Goats Gruff and being misunderstood. Billy is trying to understand the situation and brings his neighbor Walter into the secret of the island. Suddenly Billy and Walter are caught up in a frenzy of literary characters while having grand adventures and looking for treasure.The story is superbly written and very well thought out. As I said, this book is much like Inkheart, where characters are read in and out of stories by the protagonist, though this is one is a little more tame and the premise is different. I very much enjoyed reading this book and I found it a very quick read that was difficult to put down. I do think the ending sets up for the possibility of more books and I very much hope this to be true because I will be first in line for the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Q5VN1L8UOR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385388446#wasThisHelpful","R18Q5VN1L8UOR7","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an avid reader of fairy tales and I grabbed this up as soon as I saw it. I am very pleased to say I was not at all disappointed.The story is a nod to Goldilocks and the Three Bears but it differs greatly from the original story. This is the story of the three bears, in this case The Vaughn family, who live in a large house in Bremen Town (a nod to another fairy tale ""The Bremen Town musicians"" and indeed there are musicians). Mr. Vaughn is a business-bear who is quite well off and hires a governess, Ms. Ursula Brown, to educate his young son Teddy. The story is told from Ms. Brown's point of view about her missteps when she first comes to the family and as the story progresses, her thoughts and feelings about political goings-on in town regarding the humans in a group called the ""Anthropological Society"" and the ""Enchanted"", or the group of animals that have been anthropomorphized and now behave like humans and have the power of speech.The story becomes further enveloped in the original Goldilocks fairy tale with the appearance of Goldilocks herself. She is a disheveled human child who broke into the Vaughn home to steal things and was found sleeping in Teddy's (i.e. baby bear's) bed with the pilfered items next to her. Mrs. Vaughn is a tender soul and takes on care of the child. As Ms. Brown progresses in her teachings with Teddy, she is also asked to work with Goldilocks, who quickly takes to Ms. Brown. As mentioned before, as Goldilocks come further out of her shell (though she is mute for most of the story) the Vaughns begin to treat her as a member of the family, which outrages the Anthropological Society and they recruit Mother Shoe (as in, there was an old woman who lived in a shoe who had so many children she did not know what to do) to pretend to be her parent to take her away from the Vaughns.The book has a happy (obviously) and satisfying ending. I quite enjoyed the wonderful story woven by Ms. Coville and her subtle nods to other fairy tales and nursery rhymes. She is obviously very talented and I would look forward to more stories from her.One thing: I noticed this book is written for 10-year-olds. Expect many questions and to have a dictionary handy upon reading this because I had to look some words up including velocipede. I doubt many 10-year-olds know what vicissitude and miasma mean. Consider it a good vocabulary lesson. Otherwise, great book, great story, well crafted characters - definitely five stars!

"I don't usually gravitate toward books relating to spirituality, but this one caught my eye and really delivered!Linda Leaming moved to the tiny Himalayan country of Bhutan in 1997 and married a Bhutanese painter in 2000.  Since that time she has moved back and forth between the two cultures of her native Tennessee and her adopted country bridging two radically different worlds.  This experience has given her a unique perspective of the advantages and disadvantages of both places...but the bottom line seems to reinforce the viewpoint that less is more when it comes to happiness. The Bhutanese may not have all the high tech toys that so much of our lives depend upon in the West, but their simpler lifestyle seems to have rewards that we only dream of: less stress, more harmony and deeper fulfillment.Each chapter of the book is a self-contained gem that addresses a theme or principle supporting the cultivation of happiness or, as Leaming defines it, ""well-being.""  Each goes beyond providing a prescription or formula for happiness by unfolding as the author's personal insights of her own emerging awareness of the theme in her daily life activities and relationships.  Slowing down the Western mind is no easy feat and Leaming's descriptions of her process are filled with humor and humility.  While the book is primarily based on Buddhist teachings, there is no need to embrace Buddhism to enjoy these offerings.I rated this book 5 stars because I am now reading the book for a second time, savoring one chapter at a time.  I am curious to see how this Bhutanese approach to reading it again will be reflected in my own life and relationships.  I thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing style - very practical, very heartfelt, and very honest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOGZLY12CRU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945090#wasThisHelpful","RFOGZLY12CRU9","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great heist novel that I think would make an excellent movie.Our young ""hero"" March is the son of famed jewel thief and I would say criminal mastermind, Alfie McQuin. When Alfie dies in a tragic mishap, March is left alone in the world with little to his name and only what Alfie taught him about grifting to survive. With Alfie's dying words constantly playing in his mind, March learns he has a sister, Jules, whom he finds shortly after Alfie's death. Unfortunately, the two wind up in the system in New York. Fortunately, March apparently has his father's talents for escaping crummy situations. He and Jules meet Darius and Izzy and together they form a gang determined to recover seven moonstones for an heiress, stones Alfie himself had stolen. However, Alfie's old partner is out of prison and also wants to recover the stones. The rest of the story is a race to the finish line as the stones have to be recovered and returned before the blue moon.I found this story very engaging. It really captures you and makes you feel like you are part of the gang. You are horrified when something goes wrong, happy when something goes right and satisfied when the bad people are thwarted. All the characters are smartly developed and fun to read about. I secretly hope there will be more stories about March and his friends but we will wait and see.A little warning to the reader, if you get down to the last sixty pages or so, make sure you have ample time to finish before you start reading. I was very displeased when I had to stop at the last 30 and go back to work.

"This is a light-weight plastic crate that collapses easily for storage when not in use. I have several plastic totes that are cumbersome space hogs when not in use - so this ""utility box,""  as it is called, is great.Its capacity is 47.5 quarts and the weight capacity is listed as 66 pounds.

It collapses down to 2.5"" high. The open slats in the sides make it easy to clean and the molded handles on the side make it easy to carry.I foresee using this for organizational purposes and for carrying light loads.  It is great to store in the trunk of the car for transporting ""runaway groceries"" on the trip home or even for permanently organizing trunk contents. It would be great in a laundry room, a gardening shed, the garage or a closet.  Toys for kids or pets can be gathered in on spot. The one drawback is no top or lid.I recommend this multi-use crate for its attractive colors (mine is blue and black), its ease of use and its capacity for easy storage when not in use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215YCOC2TWR5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFOHX7S#wasThisHelpful","R215YCOC2TWR5M","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was full of violence, which I found a little disturbing. This book was marketed for fans of Warriors and Survivors, series I have not read, so maybe the violence was to be anticipated. However, when I think of horses I do not think of violent creatures. I found some of the violence to be graphic and frankly horrifying. When I finished the book, I honestly thought if the author had used some other animal besides horses, perhaps ones known for being territorial and capable of violence like this the book would have been far more acceptable. The Warriors are cats and Survivors dogs, things that do fight and are easily more believable than horses.My other complaint about this book is that the author uses a lot of horsey jargon I do not understand. While I think kids who have horses are drawn to books about them, I think there are plenty of readers out there who do not understand the jargon. I found this particularly confusing in reading the cast of characters section at the beginning of the book.The storyline itself (other than some of the unnecessary extreme violence) is rather clever. It is about a young foal, Star, who is the mysterious and possibly dangerous black foal Pegasus. This foal, should he survive, receives power from the Hundred Years Star and he can either emerge good or evil. Star's predecessor, Nightwing, was evil. Since Nightwing is the only comparison the herds have, everyone naturally fears Star. Star's guardian herd is the Sun Herd and their over-stallion Thunderwing has promised to kill him on his first birthday. Star is living everyday to the fullest with the knowledge he will be killed. However, things get out of hand when several events beyond Star's control end unfavorably for the Sun Herd, culminating in the capture of two of their foals by a rival herd. Star is spirited away by the lead mare, Silvercloud, to save his life. Except the rival herd wants Star in exchange for the two foals. When word gets out that Star is no longer among his guardian herd, war ensues (which could have been less vividly described, just my opinion).I initially did not like this book because I felt the author had these characters be pegasi when it suited them, then they took on more human characteristics (applying medications for example). She also uses descriptors that a horse is incapable of (like ""coiling one's hooves... it is NOT possible). I truly think that this book would have been just as good and the whole story better had the characters been something other than pegasi, something more predatory.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2OZLJKL9BWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062286064#wasThisHelpful","R3S2OZLJKL9BWA","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of the Septimus Heap novels and this new spinoff did not disappoint. We start off in the Pathfinder fishing village at a meeting of the Secret Circle of Pathfinders. The newest recruits are being let in on a huge secret of the Pathfinders, something they must keep to themselves or risk being exploited by those who would do others harm.Here we meet Alice TodHunter Moon, a young girl of 12 who is about to have her world turned upside down. I don't want to go into a lot of plot detail because this book is so thrilling to read and want to keep the pages turning that I fear most plot points would spoil it. Suffice it to say, Alice eventually makes her way to the wizard tower and meets Septimus, now 21 and the ExtraOrdinary wizard. Together with many other prior Septimus novel characters, they must save a snow kingdom from an evil villain.My issue with this, which I doubt very much most young readers would even know, is that Alice insists on being called ""Tod"", which is the German word for ""death."" I assume this is meant to be pronounced like ""Todd"" (the author never really tells you) but I just kept reading it as the German word and I found it a bit distracting. However, as I said for young readers in America I don't think this will present itself as an issue.Angie Sage has a very vivid and pleasing imagination when it comes to creating a new world filled with wonder and magic. I found the tie in to the original Septimus books to be seamless and was very happy to revisit old characters. If you are a fan of the other seven Septimus books, I highly recommend you jump into this one and get to know Tod and her friends. I would definitely bet you cannot put the book down. Great new book, I look forward to the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFZLAM3E94OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062272454#wasThisHelpful","RRFZLAM3E94OR","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dog lovers will enjoy this story - it describes the healing power of an adorable dog to open hearts and even minds. Yet the human side of the story illustrates both the dark and light sides of human nature.Andrea has gone through the trauma of a divorce from a charming, but cheating husband.  After a rocky year, she has regained her balance, but doubts she will ever allow herself to be vulnerable to love again.  Dan and his teenage daughter are still grieving the loss of their wife and mother when their cherished dog, Anni, is abducted from the driveway of their home.  Thus begins a synchronistic adventure of crossed paths and overlapping relationships until, predictably, they are united by their love of Anni.The storyline is sweet and somewhat inspiring, but as mentioned the plot is far too predictable to be great reading.  It is a refreshing change from much of the contemporary, violence-driven literature that seems to dominate much of the popular offerings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ESK1JXK7V6WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477824944#wasThisHelpful","R2ESK1JXK7V6WI","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent debut novel in a series and I cannot wait to see what else happens to the characters.Albert Flynn's parents are divorced. He usually lives with his mother in New York but summers he spends with his dad in the teeny tiny town of Herman, Wyoming. Here Albert spends his days in the dead letter office of the post office reading mail that could not be delivered in hopes of finding some clue to either return it to the sender or the recipient. Until a mysterious dog delivers him a letter that he actually must deliver.Farnsworth, the dog, leads Albert to a giant tree, which is actually a gateway to another world (if the Path Hider allows you to find it). He delivers the letter to the Path Hider and meets two other kids around his age (Leroy and Birdie, both wonderfully developed and funny characters). Together they reach the center of the Earth, also known as ""The Core."" It is here they will train to be Balance Keepers, those who keep the realms under the Earth balanced to maintain life as we know it above ground. Here they undergo training to become Balance Keepers, where they will eventually become the First Unit for the title realm, Calderon. Crisis happens of course and eventually Albert, Leroy and Birdie are called upon to enter Calderon despite rookie status and save the world.The exceptional detail the author goes into to create these worlds beneath our world is very imaginative, you can almost picture the passageways and mysterious creatures she develops easily. She also writes wonderfully buffoonish bullies and other minor characters, making each one an integral part of the story.I could not put this book down and the times I had to I was very disappointed in having to tear myself away from the story. I eagerly anticipate the next book in this fantastic new series. Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ZI3EN3LFS5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062275186#wasThisHelpful","R16ZI3EN3LFS5Z","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read all three books in the Chronicles of Kazam books and this one did not disappoint. The book starts out where the previous left off shortly after the bridge game to see what house would hold the enchantment license for the Kingdom of Snodd. The gang has to capture a vicious Tralfamosaur (like a T-rex but â€œwithout the sunny dispositionâ€).The book progresses that Jennifer Strange manager of Kazam and Court Mystician to the King is summoned to the palace before the king and queen. Jennifer is tasked with looking after their very rude and spoiled daughter to groom her to become a humble ruler. How she does this is up to her. On the way back from the palace she is accosted by the minions of the Mighty Shandar, whom she is taken to meet and given a quest. Shandar wants her to find the elusive and mysterious Eye of Zoltar or he will kill the two dragons (Feldspar and Colin) that Jennifer has spared from extinction (done in the first book in the chronicles). Having no choice, she undertakes the journey, not quest, as a quest needs to be registered with the Questing Federation with lots of paperwork and permits involved.They have to go to the Cambrian Empire, a place where perilous tourism keeps the national economy stable and everything can kill you (kind of like Australia, but with fewer pleasant citizens). Here danger and some hilarity ensue as Jennifer, the princess, the wizard Perkins and several others they take on to flush out their 50% promised mortality rate, embark on a journey to find the Eye of Zoltar and save the dragons.I love Jasper Ffordeâ€™s ability to create wondrous places full of daring characters and weirdo critters. All of his books are very much like this but his imagination clearly does not lack material so that every book is different. His humor is always very clever, usually also very dry.  Jennifer is a truly magnificent person, so much so I wish she was real and I want to be her friend. All of his characters are very well written and well developed and from his descriptions I can picture the creatures and settings alike. I only wish this book had more of the quarkbeast (though he would have been woefully out of place). I eagerly look forward to more books in the Chronicles of Kazam series and a peek inside Ffordeâ€™s expansive mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQ3BQ2M2F81G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547738498#wasThisHelpful","R2EQ3BQ2M2F81G","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a hard book to read due to the bullying aspect. Everywhere now you read how children are so cruel to other children simply because they are poor, have long hair (like Brendan), have birthmarks, talk/dress funny, etc. Most of the time bullying is simply because someone does not like you and it is wrong regardless of context. These children in this book are no exception and are just plain awful.Poor Brendan is an outcast who has been abandoned by his mother and foster mother (figuratively speaking as she pays little attention to him). He has been passed around in foster homes and has an overall feeling of worthlessness. It is only when he fails the sixth grade (because of lack of attentiveness, not because he is unintelligent) and meets Shea in summer school does he start to blossom. He finds the perfect place for a tree house and meets the Green Man in the woods.This is a story about overcoming self-esteem issues and bullying, well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3S21PDSTJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544230205#wasThisHelpful","R1W3S21PDSTJD","A14482T71JR6VU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14482T71JR6VU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well I would have loved this knife if it wasn't slighly defective out of the box.The part of the knife you have to push to close it is VERY stiff and I actually hurt my fingers from pushing on it. I am a guitar player so I do not have weak or delicate fingers; my fingers are strong. Also I bought it with 3 other knives and both the other 2 had a lock-release that was very easy to use.So I had to send it back for a replacement. If the replacement is fine then I'll chalk it up to ""random chance"" and raise my review to 4 or 5 stars.What I like about this knife is it's just the right size and weight for a pocket, as opposed to one of the Sanrenmu's I bought which is just way too heavy for a pocket knife.I also like that this Gerber has a lifetime warranty. Of course as with most such warranties, who knows if they will actually honor it; only time will tell.I also love the flip out lever on the bottom of the knife that makes this knife very easy and quick to open with one hand.Except for the lock-release issue it seems very well made and if most of them do not have a manufacturing defect like this, then I would say this is a great knife to buy as an Every Day Carry pocket knife!Again, I will revise my review to 4 or 5 stars IF they send me a replacement that has a lock-release that is as easy to release the locked blade as it should be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMHS5F4IHJ8UH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q7V6PU#wasThisHelpful","RMHS5F4IHJ8UH","AFE0AGQT50MBJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFE0AGQT50MBJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally gave this 5 stars... It worked so I put it away until I needed it.I needed it today - after having turned it on 2- 3 times previously then taking the batteries out to store it for a power outage.So I put the batteries in today and it wouldn't turn on. Then the batteries got stuck and I couldn't get them out without shaking it.I shook it and finally got them out and tested them to make sure they were in right and that they still had sufficient energy in them. Put them in another flashlight and they worked fine.Took them out of that good flashlight and loaded them back in, positive end towards the bulb, and checked to see if they would work. No.Took them out and checked again that they were in correctly. No power. No light.Thus I tell you that this light is a typical Chinese P.O.S. and if you don't know what P.O.S means it means it is a piece of excrement, that is to say, it is junk. Garbage. Crapola.Do not buy this. It's a total waste of money. Too bad because it put out a good amount of light - the first day.Now I have to find a similar light that actually works when needed and doesn't break the 2nd time I use it!","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVV2J1RG6U7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Z36V6M#wasThisHelpful","R2BVV2J1RG6U7X","AFE0AGQT50MBJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFE0AGQT50MBJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comparing this, the Sanrenmu 7056 Series Pocket Folding Knife, the Sanrenmu 7010LUC-SA 710 Pocket EDC Folding Knife and theGerber 22-41493 EVO Jr. Serrated Edge Knife.First the 2 Sanremnu's:The 7056 is noticeably heavier - it weighs in at 111 grams vs 88.5 grams for the 7010LUC-SA.Both knives are well made and almost exactly the same size, folded, with the same size and shape of blade.As it turns out I would like to have features of each one in the other one.I wish the 7056 was as light as the 7010.And I wish the 7010 had the lever on the bottom of it like the 7056 does, to flip it open.As I said, both are made well and - not having used them yet and judging only by look and feel and judgment of quality from looking and handling - both are good buys.However I would not keep either one for myself due to my own personal taste. Hopefully the 2 guys I'm giving these 2 will not care about the same issues as I do and will be happy to get them, as I would be if it were a gift.So what I want is a knife with the lever on the bottom for opening it quickly, but the weight of the 7010 or perhaps even a little lighter weight than the 7010.I just find this knife, the 7056, too heavy to carry around in my pocket all day. I'm not a knife expert so maybe there's a big advantage to having a heavier pocket knife. If so please enlighten me (no pun intended). But for my taste I think I prefer a lighter knife. If I need a heavier knife for heavier duty I will have my Buck 119BKS Spec Hunting 6"" near by.Now the Gerber:The Gerber is much lighter at only 52 grams, less than half the weight of the Sanenmu 7056. It is also smaller which helps account for the weight. The Gerber has a lever on the bottom to open it (or get it started opening and then just a flick of the wrist can open it the rest of the way). The Sanrenmu 7056 also has this feature.However the Gerber came with the mechanism to fold the knife back up after it locks into place, being very stiff and it actually hurts my fingers to push it in in order to close it. I have very strong fingers (I play guitar) so this is in fact a defect. I have ordered a replacement and hopefully it will be better. If not I will refund it. It *might* loosen with use or I might be able to put some silicon or oil on it to make it work better. I'm not a knife expert so not sure but I feel it should work out of the box so I'll give it at least one return and then see what happens. If it still doesn't work, I'll try lubing it before returning it for a refund.That said, I like the Gerber the best of the 3. If it were as easy to close as it should be it would be my favorite by far.I prefer it for the weight and slightly smaller size. I realize that you really can't compare a larger knife to a smaller knife because it comes down to what you prefer. But I wasn't sure what I wanted so I bought all 3 so I could make a decision which one to keep for myself and then give the other 2 as gifts.All 3 are well reviewed and all 3 are quality knives - again, notwithstanding the unlocking problem with the Gerber which I hope to be replaced with one that closes more easily as it should.I feel that anyone would be happy to get any of these 3 knives as a small gift. For a bigger gift, get a more expensive knife, perhaps a higher quality Gerber, Buck, Ontario, or Scrade... preferably an American made knife.These 3 are all Chinese made (not 100% sure re the Gerber but pretty sure it is Made In China as most cheap knives are and I know that even Buck and other famous ""USA"" knife companies are farming out their cheaper knives to China manufacturers. They may say ""USA"" on them but not ""Made In USA""!) but the Gerber one has a limited lifetime warranty whereas these 2 Sanrenmus are only warrantied for 90 days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPQ7N6S5OJU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVAOIMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1MPQ7N6S5OJU4","AFE0AGQT50MBJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFE0AGQT50MBJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to buy this all the time. Now I find out it has titanium dioxide in it so I won't be chewing it any more!Why a HEALTH brand gum would put an ingredient used in suntan lotion and cosmetics in their gum for us to chew is beyond me. DUMB and DUMBEST!Sure, I know ""they say"" it's okay. They also said cigarettes were okay, back when they first came out!The only reason to buy gum like this is to avoid aspartame and sugar!So why then would I want to NOT avoid titanium dioxide???SPRY management: Are you people insane?All anyone has to do is look up titanium dioxide on a search engine like yahoo and you'll find the scientific reports saying its a possible carcinogen; or a likely carcinogen as the case may be. I KNOW they say it's the powder that's bad. But that's like saying smoking cigarettes is bad but chewing tobacco is not... (They used to think THAT too!)Also, everyone searching as I am for a healthy chewing gum should read Dr. Mercola's article on ""5 Common Chewing Gum Ingredients That May Cause Cancer"". A search engine should come up with it if you type that title in.According to Dr. Mercola ""gum base"" often contains:petroleum-derived paraffin wax, polyvinyl acetate (carpenter's glue) and talc, which is linked to cancer.So far even BFresh says it uses gum base. The question is: What is IN the gum base or what is it made out of?

"I generally like this jacket and I bought it because it seems to be made well.There are a couple things I don't like though:* It says it's breathable but it doesn't feel that breathable and I thought since it was breathable it would have holes here and there to let out condensation from within like some other rain jackets I've had. It has no holes under the arms or anywhere so I am doubtful about how breathable it is going to be.* The hood comes way down over your eyes when you pull it over your head. I figured out that I can fold it under so I can still see but if you don't, you will basically be walking around only being able to see downward, say, 20 feet in front of you. I think this is another design flaw as above. I am going to attach some velcro so I can make sure it stays folded under when I wear the hood so I can see ahead of me.I almost sent it back because of the above issues but decided to keep it and try it out in real rainy weather to see how it is.

"This clip is interesting in the fact that it has a magnetic catch and it holds very well.- the idea is that the part that attaches to the Lifeproof case is grabbed by the belt clip - when you want to remove, just rotate the phone and it lets go - very easy and simple to use.- Easy to install the attachment piece to the case - just clean it with the included alcohol wipe, let it dry and use the included template for placement.The real drawback is that with my iphone 6plus - having the phone on my belt is a bit odd - the thing is huge.I honestly don't know a lot of people who still use belt clips - however this one is VERY secure and quick access to the phone is easy.Overall it's ok.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB5MH87XVHBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIF2GUO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB5MH87XVHBU","A2BIJMB2BITQUM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIJMB2BITQUM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lifeproof certainly makes some of the most, if not the most protective cases out there.I have been waiting for this case for quite a while and was very pleased when it showed up as an option to test on my Vine list. The idea of a waterproof case is just awesome!I received the case - LOTS of packaging - and checked out the installation instructions - fairly straight forward.WARNING - make sure you have the seal visible on the screen to ensure it will remain waterproof - if the seal is folded, it will be obvious and you can remove the case and start over.Installation was not challenging other than making sure everything snapped together properly. Removal is actually a bit more challenging than installation, however working the case from the 'coin' slot around got it done.One quite impressive feature is that this case installed fine over my Zagg Glass screen protector - the Glass is a very thick screen protector, so this is a huge positive.Pros:- Protection in the extreme!- Waterproof!- no need for a screen protector as it uses the screen to seal the case.- Installed over my very thick Zagg Glass - no issues.- Fits like a glove.- Fingerprint ID works fine with this installed.Cons:- Initial indications are that the sound quality is reduced when using this case. There are covers over the speakers and the microphone (there have to be to keep it waterproof) - one person I was talking to described it as sounding 'muffled'.- You have to use their screw in cable connector for your wired headset - not a great feature, unless you plan on swimming with this thing using waterproof headphones.- Silent/ringer button manipulation took some getting used to to get it right - once you work on how the external button manipulated the little switch, it gets easier.Overall, if you are worried about using your phone in potentially wet areas, or are particularly hard on your phone - this is definitely the case for you.It has some drawbacks, however the idea that it is better protected than any other case probably makes up for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVKY0QGKRI4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLHWTNA#wasThisHelpful","RXVKY0QGKRI4Q","A2BIJMB2BITQUM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIJMB2BITQUM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Parrot Zik 2.0 is a very expensive headset. That's the opener and there's no way around it.What do you get for the price? Well that's where Parrot has done a very nice job.- Noise cancelling (note - noise cancelling does not work when using as a phone headset)- lightweight- easy to adjust- simple controls - the touch pad is interesting- user-replaceable battery- great Bluetooth connections- Very comfortable to wear (a little hot on warm days)I started off just trying these out for music - very nice sound quality and I could leave my phone/pad downstairs and walk around the house without losing the connection. ++I find the size adjustment to be just fine for my regular sized noggin.Very cool features, such as auto-Bluetooth disconnect so you can reconnect to whatever you have at hand without going through gyrations. Auto-pause when you take them off your ears - starts right back up when you replace them. :)setup and charging is simple and easy - I haven't done a time test for how long they will last but no issues so far.phone use as a headset is fine - kind of nice not to have that dangling cord.So - for the price you get a soft bag - and with them in the bag and in my briefcase - that can and have inadvertently turned on. I'm not sure why Parrot does not include the hard case for the price :(The only source for additional batteries appears to be Parrot - hmph......Overall very nice, full featured and great quality.Update - 4/2/15- So I had a request to determine how these sound in a dead battery condition wired - they can be used wired to the source like any other headphone.- Sound quality remains excellent- Can also still be used as a phone headset - the included cable has all three connections - l/r/micI remain a fan of these headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E22ZS2QXAYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPZG6DW#wasThisHelpful","R25E22ZS2QXAYZ","A2BIJMB2BITQUM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIJMB2BITQUM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tacwise Z1-140 is a good, functional compact staple gun.It uses 6mm or 8mm staples - which are not the 'heavy duty' type you may be accustomed to using in larger, heavier guns.In my initial testing, this staple gun performed well - you do have to ensure the handle gets ALL the way to the up position in order for it to engage properly and fire the next staple.The force required to fire the staples is fairly light when compared to other, larger staplers. This would make it much easier to use for younger users or those with forearms less bulky than Popeye's ;)The handy integrated belt/pocket hook is a GREAT feature.The ability to fold the handle down and lock it is also a great feature.I think the only issue I have with the staple gun is that it's nearly entirely made from plastic - this gives it a less than hefty feel.

"These strips are basically like velcro - you clean the surface to mount on - attach the strips - wait a few minutes - let the adhesive set - and your are ready to go.Installation is simple - if you mess it up - get extras so you can do it again. removal is simple as with all command products.Each strip will notionally hold about four pounds - so putting four strips on heavier items makes it not only secure, but safe.Smaller/lighter items can be attached with a single pair or two.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITLIFO1L9FKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00404YKZI#wasThisHelpful","R2ITLIFO1L9FKI","A2BIJMB2BITQUM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIJMB2BITQUM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The AllStrike is a bit odd when you first receive it. Basically a disembodied head with a handle deep inside.I took it to my Krav Maga school so we could evaluate it and see how we liked it.It's easy to hold, the hand hold bar inside the head is angled well for proper alignment.The head is made from durable foam similar to other products used in martial arts.Striking is simple enough and you are able to strike without gloves with no harm to your hands. It's like striking a head shaped pad.Also great for knee strike practice as the chin area and sides are thick foam.

"Ever since I ran across Sarah Besseyâ€™s writing and especially when reading her first book Jesus Feminist: An Invitation to Revisit the Bible's View of Women, I have been struck by her ability to be inclusive and draw people together through her writing. Traditionally discussion of womenâ€™s roles is an exclusionary task, but Bessey, while clearly advocating for more inclusion of women in leadership and teaching roles in the church, was careful to not alienate those that disagreed with her.In her new book, Out of Sorts: Making Peace With an Evolving Faith, she is equally adept at drawing the reader in. Out of Sorts is a hard book to describe. It is memoir-ish. It is a book about church and Besseyâ€™s difficulties with the church, but it is not a complaint book. It is about spiritual growth and formation, denominations, Women, maturity, community and a variety of other topics.The overriding theme is that faith changes over time. The faith we have as children is not the same faith we have as teens, which is not the same faith we have in our 20s or 40s or later. Besseyâ€™s parents came to faith when she was a child, but old enough to remember. She grew up in small town Western Canada, where there were few enough Christians that she was relatively unaware of the differences between Christian groups. As she ventured out into the world she came to new understandings as she became acquainted with other Christians.Other than her pentecostal childhood, I think she is telling a story that is not too different from my own and many others that I know. Age and experience brought questions, but also a new ability to trust in faith. Most people I know have at least some difficulty with church abuse or burnout, and then most of those make their way back to church. Many people recently have been exploring more liturgical forms of Christianity.Bessey, at least at this point, is a bit of a fish out of water everywhere. She is not quite comfortable in her historic pentecostal background. She is not quite comfortable with the more liturgical settings, the evangelical mega church, likewise has many positive features but also many negative ones.There is very little judgement from Bessey. She wants people to land where they need to land. But she wants them to land in a faith community. If there is a single takeaway, it is that while they may be flawed, our faith communities are essential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R10ATTP0K55I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0232532397#wasThisHelpful","R2R10ATTP0K55I","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NT Wright is not only an increadibly prolific writer, he also seems to be continually updating his earlier books.The Meal Jesus Gave Us was originally published in 2002 and was revised this summer.Wright is known for his academic publishing, but this is one of his books that is oriented toward the non-professional. If anything this might have been over simplified. This new version is slightly edited and has added discussion questions. It would make a decent study for an adult confirmation class or a small group.The book opens with a short introduction imagining what a birthday party might look like to a martian unfamiliar with human rituals. After a brief discussion of human rituals conveying meaning, Wright spends a couple of chapters imagining what a disciple at the Last Supper and then an early Christian would think about communion.The second section (the last short 9 chapters) attempts to put some theological meat on the previous imaginings. Because it is Wright, communion is placed in context of early Jewish thought, the kingdom of God, the eschatalogical vision of Christianity (end times), how communion reflects Jesus death and resurrection and more.Along the way Wright briefly explores the ways that different streams of Christianity view communion, he explores the different names that it is given, and some of the church history and theological issues.The final chapter explores some of the practical theology that goes along with communion. How often should it be taken, who should take it, who should officiate, etc.NT Wright, when this was first written was an Anglican Bishop and this book follows Anglican theology, although non-Anglicans should not be afraid to read it.It is very brief, only about 95 pages of main content and I read it without any problem in an evening. It raises lots of good questions and does a good job presenting the importance of communion to the church theologically, practically and ritually.I do think that in the end, I expected a bit more meat to the book. It is definately an introduction and I think it makes a very good introduction. He does a good job presenting some of the controversial issues in a non-controversial way. It is clear that he believes that communion is very important and along with the Word (preaching and scripture reading) is central to Christian worship.For less than 100 pages of content I am not sure what else needed to be added as central. But I am again amazed at Wrightâ€™s ability to write to a wide variety of audiences well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYB483SWXRYSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664261299#wasThisHelpful","RYB483SWXRYSG","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: I am dropping to 3 stars.  When it works it works great.  But for a reason I have not discovered yet, it seems to leak about every third refill.  I am not sure why it is leaking but it is.  So I always put it on a towel so that it doesn't ruin the dresser it is sitting on.______________I got this for my nearly 2 year old's room. She loves the stars and the humidifier works well.There are a couple of issues with the design that keep it from being 5 stars.  First the area of the projection, while fairly bright is not all that big. I have this on a dresser out of her reach so she does not pull it down on herself. But the actual projection is only about 24-28 inches wide. Second it only points straight up.  In other room designs this might not be a problem, but in her room that means the projection is on the opposite side of the room as her bed.The first time I used it, I must not have gotten the seal closed properly and it leaked all over the place.  Every time after that I have checked the seal and it has not leaked a drop.  So it was clearly human error.  It is always a problem with humidifiers.

"have been vaguely aware of Thomas Oden but I have not previously read anything by him.I was first aware of his books on early African Christianity such as The African Memory of Mark: Reassessing the Early Church Tradition. I was not really aware that he was also the driving force behind the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series.People I know of kept mentioning how good this memoir was and when I had some Amazon promotional credit I bought it (it is the most expensive memoir I have ever purchased, which is why I have not read it previously.)Oden is similar in age to Eugene Peterson, Kalistos Ware, Pope Benedict, Martin Marty and Richard John Neuhaus. All of these theologians lived through a strange time. They were born between the wold wars in a global recession. The first wave of progressive modernity had passed with the world wars and a new death of god liberalism came to the fore with their adulthood.Oden fully embraced liberal theology as an academic theologian (and unusual for then, but not today, also a working pastor). In his late 30s he started to struggle with the weaknesses of the liberal movement, ecumenism (as illustrated by the World Council of Churches) and his own faith.A major turning point was his first sabbatical, which he spent in Europe interacting with many of his theological heroes and as an observer with Vatican II. Over the next decade he started promoting â€˜classical Christianityâ€™ through â€˜paleo-orthodoxyâ€™, a theological method that rejected innovation but instead relied on early church (Patristic) sources.Once committed to paleo-orthodoxy (he was differentiating from neo-orthodoxy), he pledged to not intentionally write anything new. For Oden, the way forward was by fully understanding those that were closest to the time of Jesus. These early writers were following in the steps of Paul in 2 Cor 2:2 by saying nothing new about Jesus.  Oden is also committed to the consensus teaching. One of his other projects was to determine exactly what is agreed upon by different groups.  So one book project was taking over 100 evangelical statements of faith and determining what was affirmed by all of them. (And this was really what at heart was the point of the Ancient Christian Commentary series as well.)For an armchair theologian such as myself, this was a fascinating book. Oden has had a global reach, geographically, denominationally and historically. He was friends with a number of Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant theologians. He credits a conversation with Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict) for encouraging him to attempt the Ancient Christian Commentary series. He was involved in the Evangelicals and Catholics Together movement as well as a number of other ecumenical movements based around traditional Christian orthodox beliefs.Oden was also an incredibly prolific author. Based on my count he was the author of at least 58 books, not including the Ancient Christian Commentary series which he was the general editor and also the author of a couple of the books in the series (also not counting different editions of books as multiple.)As someone that has been seriously working through my own journey of faith and looking back toward the historic Christian streams of faith, it is clear that whether I knew of him or not, Oden is someone that has influenced many that have also influenced me.For those that are less theology nerds and less interested in historic Christian streams of faith, this will be less interesting. Like many memoirs there is a lot of â€˜and then I wrote thisâ€™ and â€˜and then I met these peopleâ€™. If you are not aware of at least some of the players and background story it could get a bit boring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39H9WCHBF55EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUCPUH4#wasThisHelpful","R39H9WCHBF55EQ","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The fit is pretty much perfect.  And it is a nice looking shirt.  I didn't realize I had bought the 'trim fit' one until I started to write the review. I am not too heavy but I this is not what I would consider an 'athletic cut' so if you are pretty skinny, this might be a bit too big, but it fits me perfectly.The description says 100% cotton, 100% polyester (which is obviously a misprint).  The actual shirt says 60% cotton and 40% polyester, which is standard for a shirt that is wrinkle free.  I washed it right out of the package and put it on right out of the dryer and it needed an iron.One other nice thing is the packaging. Normally with a dress shirt there is about 12 pin that keep the shirt in place and looking good in the package.  But those small holes can show up for a long time. (I have bought dress shirts on more than several occasions for immediate use.)  But this short was primarily packages with fancy looking paper clip things.  So no holes.

"I used these bottles for my daughter (and now my son) so I was interested in these as a gift set for friends that are are newly pregnant.The gift packages is well designed.  It comes with four bottles (4 oz) and four size one nipples.  There is also two size 2 nipples and 2 size 3 nipples. My daughter started using the size 3 around six months.  And it is about that time that you would most likely start using the 8 oz size bottles.The gift set also includes a specially designed bottle brush.  These bottles are a bit oddly shaped so the bottle brush that will get into the crevice at the bottom is a good idea.Also there are two adapters for your breast pump to be able to pump directly into the bottles, which is  a really nice addition that I wish we had for our bottles.  Because after two years these are still the primary bottles I use.One other nice feature of the bottle that is included in the gift set is the seals for travel.  I have used a couple other bottles that have different types of seals. Other than these ones (and Doc Browns which I don't like for other reasons) all other seals required you keep the nipple separate away from the bottle.  But these bottles allow a seal to fit underneath the nipple and then you can just remove the nipple take the seal off and put the nipple back on.

Once it has been applied, you do not even feel it on your skin, again, unlike other cream make-ups I have tried. If you are someone who doesn't like having multiple make-up brushes, going with this cream based make-up that is applied using your fingers is a great alternative. It also doesn't create the dust mess that powder blushes do. If this was the same price as my normal powder blush, I'd buy it instead...however it costs about 3 times as much.

"I ran out of the plain rice cereal (that was originally purchased for my almost 2 year old daughter.)  So I picked this up as something different.

"I, as an expectant father, was particularly drawn in because the book opens and closes with birth stories. Birth and death are natural places where we see God because they are such transcendent experiences. But in between birth and death God sometimes gets a little lost (or at least we lose sight of God in the midst of our busyness).Most of the stories are in some way about family, community and the church. We have a tendency to live as if we are alone. But it is in community, our families, the church, neighbors, friends, that we often most clearly see and hear God. (This is very similar to the focus in Eugene Peterson's Practice Resurrection).Except for the fact that Weber can write prose more beautifully than almost anyone I have ever read, she is a normal mom, wife, teacher, writer, Christian. She does not have a particularly large circle of influence, she is not a pastor to thousands or leader of a large business or non-profit. She is not a household name. So I can relate to the way she loses sight of God in the mundane. Because it is in the mundane that most of us live our lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SY9A7A1NGLKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZF1EJE#wasThisHelpful","R1SY9A7A1NGLKP","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you asked me what my favorite thing to do, on the list would be floating in the ocean reading. Several years ago I found a floating waterproof case for my Kindle 2. And up until recently I had still been using it. But it finally broke and on impulse I picked up a Waterfi Waterproof Kindle Paperwhite two weeks ago right before I went to the beach for a weekâ€™s vacation.The first thing you notice about Waterfiâ€™s waterproofed Paperwhite is that it is basically indistinguishable from a regular Paperwhite. The waterproofing is not visible and doesnâ€™t add any weight (at least not enough to be noticiable).Waterfi is an aftermarket system. So you purchasing one from Waterfi voids the Amazon warranty.There are two main negatives about the Waterfi system that was not true of my old floating Kindle case. First, it does not float. So if I dropped it in the ocean, I would have go grab it. I have thought about how to create some type of float for it, but I havenâ€™t worked that out yet. I was just careful when I was swimming with it.The second negative is that because the Paperwhite is a touch screen device that moves by electical conduction, hard spray from salt water can turn the page or turn on the screen. It was not a huge problem, but I did need to try to keep it out of the spray to actually pay attention to the book.But those two negatives aside, it was waterproof, the screen was not at all fuzzy as the one waterproof case for the Paperwhite that I have tried was.The Waterfi Paperwhites are the ad-free version, which is $20. So essentially the waterproofing is a $1000 premium.Waterfi also sells waterproof iPod shuffles (and headphones) for swimmers, waterproof Fitbits and several other items.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBJ1W0NO4WYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VD8W38#wasThisHelpful","R2RBJ1W0NO4WYE","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a big fan of Mr Rogers. Part of what made me pick up this book was a desire to re-connect with the peacefulness of Mr Rogers for my children. My daughter is just old enough that she is starting to pay attention to TV and enjoys the cartoon adaptation of Daniel Tiger. It didnâ€™t hurt that I picked up the book while it was on sale.Peaceful Neighbor explores Mr Rogers pacifism in two parts. The first is the direct understand of pacifism as being against war and violence. This is explored through looking at Mr Rogerâ€™s personal history as well as how he dealt with war and violence on the TV show and how in later years of the Gulf War and post 9/11 he was politically active in small ways.The second section is a look at peace in other ways, including Mr Rogers understanding of racism, hunger, gay rights, environmentalism and his personal vegetarianism.I found much of the book interesting as an abstract understanding of Mr Rogers as a liberal mainline Christian. That may seem dismissive, but it is not intended to be. Many liberal mainline Christians do not spend their whole lives living out their ideals. In many ways Mr Rogers is one of the best spokespersons for Christianity of the late 20th century. Many, many people know he was an ordained minister. Many people have commented about his real love of the other and how he cared for those around him.But as with any good book, Long is aware of Mr Rogerâ€™s faults as well. He primarily wanted to speak through his show and with few exceptions, he did not act politically or become a spokesperson outside of his show for the causes he believed in. Mr Rogers also had some blind spots. For instance, he paid his staff quite poorly and they did not have his personal wealth to fall back on. One instance he gave to hunger relief organizations on behalf of his staff instead of Christmas gifts, without really understanding that the Christmas gifts might have been important to some of the staff.As much as I love the subject, the book I thought was too long and not biographical enough. It spends more time analyzing episodes of the TV show than biographical details. This is not a biography, so maybe I am asking too much, but I think more biography and less episode analysis would have been helpful. Similarly, the method of walking through different subject areas for each chapter seemed repetitive here. It worked well in the recent biography of Billy Graham because the subjects were so varied. But here the subjects were too similar and I by the time I was about 2/3 of the way through, I was getting bored.In spite of my boredom, I finished and it sparked a desire to watch some of the old episodes, which are available via Amazon Prime and other streaming methods. Mr Rogers was important and the subject is worth the book. As far as I can tell there is not a well reviewed full biography of Mr Rogers. There is one other book that looks interesting, The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers, but again it is not a full bio.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWFX2UEPYLAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UU1FLG2#wasThisHelpful","R1TWFX2UEPYLAT","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 2: So After using both at the same time for a while, I still come back to the fact that I like the screen and accuracy of the nuyu, but the software of the Jawbone.  Also I never take the jawbone off.  I could use the nuyu as a watch which would eliminate the need to take it off the clothing keep it on, but then I would have two things on my wrist.  If the software that goes with the nuyu gets a major upgrade I might use it instead of the jawbone at some point.  But even though I think the hardware is better than the jawbone, I am going to be using the jawbone.Update: After a backpacking trip I am even more impressed by the hardware, but more disappointed by the software. I comparison to the Jawbone24 which I also took this was much more useful and accurate. I wore it in my pocket compared to the wrist with the Jawbone. For some unknown reason, the Jawbone just didn't record steps for two days of the trip. Also the screen made it actually useful while hiking to check time and steps.The screen is sometimes hard to get to turn on, especially when you are all sweaty.The major weakness is still the software. I can't record calories and the ability to look at historical data is present, but not as easy or clear as it should be.Neither of these are perfectly accurate, but the nuyu seems much more accurate than the Jawbone24. That being said, I never take the jawbone off and usually wear the nuyu on my belt loop. So I forget to wear it sometimes.  I might just stop using the Jawbone, but I really like the calorie counter part of the software._________I have only used this briefly, but I am going to take it on a backpacking trip this week and I will update.After my brief use there are several really good features.First it fits well as a watch. It is snug and does not take up too much space. (I am a guy with relatively small hands and wrists. This is will fit a much larger wrist, but I think it will look better for women and men that have smaller wrists.)I like the clear numbers. They are not super bright outside, but still quite readable.The battery is a positive and negative. Because it is replaceable, you will have an ongoing cost. But because it is a watch battery it will last a long time.I have a jawbone 24 that I am comparing it to. The jawbone is much thicker and I usually take it off when I am typing because it is too thick to type comfortably. Also its battery is built in and must be recharged about every 10 days.  That is not a big deal either, but it really depends on how you use it which you would prefer.I like that there is an option for clipping it on clothes or putting it in a pocket.  One of the major negatives for the jawbone is that It doesn't record steps accurately when I am pushing a stroller.  Because I am a stay at home Dad, virtually all my exercise is while pushing a stroller.  When just walking both the jawbone and nuyu seem very close to one another in counting steps.  But when pushing the stroller, the nuyu is more accurate, even when I put the jawbone in my pocket.The major negative for the nuyu is that the software is not as complete.  The jawbone allows me to put in food and counts calories and makes health suggestions.  The nuyu counts steps and distance and estimates calories but nothing related to food.  Although you can put in your weight and track that on the nuyu if you want.  Also the nuyu does not work with other apps. So you can't sync with a number of iPhone health trackers or nest thermostat or many other apps.One more place where there nuyu is not as good as the Jawbone is in notifications. There are a number of notifications you can set up the jawbone for. You can have it ping you every 30 minutes (or whatever time you want) to get up. Or you can set it up to let you know if you have not been active in  specified time. You can use it as silent alarm in the morning. You can ask it to let you know when you have completed 2000 steps or to remind you that it is a specific time of the day.  The vibrations are all good and strong, but silent.  This just isn't an option for the nuyu.Honestly I like the nuyu better as a device, but the software on the jawbone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38N1XGIRGDK34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRPT6Z0#wasThisHelpful","R38N1XGIRGDK34","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all this is a big playset. Make sure you have place for it.  Mine is in the basement and it is not moving anywhere else.Second, this really is a good set for kids ages 1 to 5. My daughter is 21 months and loves playing with it in her own way, although not necessarily as it was intended.  She likes to 'zoom' the car around and make noises.  She occasionally will use the remote control portion of the toy, but mostly she watches while I remote control the car.This also gets marks for being flexible, it can set up in a couple different configurations and once I sat down and started I had it set up in about a half hour (not including stickers, which I refuse on principle to ever apply.)There are two negatives. First the elevator has not worked since the first day. I think there is a broken gear somewhere, so I either just doing include it in the track or the car gets lifted up.  It goes up about 2 inches and stops.The second negative is that the car batteries (which were included and installed) were dead enough to not move the car, but had enough juice to keep making noise.  I should have guessed earlier than I did, that the batteries needed changing, but I spent a while trying to figure out what was wrong with the car and track.  There is not a lot of directions or help provided, but I would have liked the batteries to not come installed so I knew they were working.I would really rate this about a 3.5 if that were an option.  I like it, I think it will work well for a while.  I think that except for the elevator, there isn't much else that could break.My last comment is that things like this should always come with two cars and two controllers.

"My daughter is 23 lb, 21 month old. This seat should last her a good long time.Overall I am very happy with it in the few days I have had it.  It is easy to understand. The hooks to get it in the seat are convient and have places to store for the ones that can't be used.  I have a couple of vehicles that I will need to use seat belts to connect.  I have not used that yet, but it is easy to see how they connect and it is better than the way several other seats I have used connect with seatbelt.There are a couple issues.  I like the built in crotch protector, but the crotch portion of the seat seems to far back to the seat. My daughter is still very small and I almost moved that strap up. And there is only one more slot forward to move it up to.I like the cup holder's placement. One of the issues with other toddler car seats I have used is that the cup holders are out of reach of the child. My daughter can reach this without a problem and can reach to the bottom of the cup.  The only issue with the cup holder is that by its design, you can't use any cups that have a handle on them. At this age they don't have to have handled cups, but the cup that traditionally we kept in the car for water had a handle in it and I had to switch it out.The only other consideration is the head rest.  I have a Mazda 5 and all of the head rests in the car lean slightly forward. I am not a fan of this design, but this seat does not fit well with that.  Right now I have it at its lowest setting.  It is right below the car's headrest.  I tried to move it up and I can't move up the Graco seat without removing the car's headrest unless I am willing to create a space between the carseat and the back of the seat of the car.  Most people won't have an issue with this, but if you have a headrest that leans forward and can't be removed, you might want to consider a different type of seat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D55CPJ6J6Z78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2863CA#wasThisHelpful","R3D55CPJ6J6Z78","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I very much respect Mark Nollâ€™s work as a historian.  So after re-reading The Civil War as Theological Crisis I found God and Race in American Politics.Noll is primarily known as a historian of North American Evangelicalism.  But this is a natural followup to his Civil War as Theological Crisis.  Instead of looking at the theological response to issues of race and slavery (as he did in Civil War), Noll expands his view to take a quick survey at how Race and Religion interacted over the history of the US until the 2004 Presidential Election.As you might expect a good historian to say, the reality is much more complicated than the traditional story that is told in your 4th grade US history class.  But Noll does a very good job surveying those complications in less than 200 pages.His first chapter covers a lot of similar ground as the Civil War as theological crisis.  Essentially, the common reading of the bible prior to the Civil War was that slavery was a biblical practice, and calling for the end of slavery as a theological statement for most people meant that they had to reject the common reading of scripture and be accused of rejecting orthodox Christianity.  And many abolitionists did explicitly reject Christianity (or at least the more orthodox forms of Christianity).  But here, Noll spends a good bit of time observing that it was not slavery, but racially based slavery that was the real issue.  The widespread belief in white racial superiority meant that Christians were able to accept the plain reading of scripture that said that slavery was acceptable, but not the plain reading of scripture that said that Blacks were of one faith with Whites.This became even more pronounced in the post-civil war era.  Because many of those abolitionists were more focused on the restraining the institutions of government than on solving the problems of integrating former slaves into the political and social system of the US.The rise of the independent African American church was important to the racial identity of African Americans.  This is a more widely understood narrative, and the shortest section of Nollâ€™s book.  But it is still important.  Modern complaints about racially divided church, often ignore or gloss over the reasons for a racially divided church.It is when Noll starts talking about the rise of Jim Crow and then moves into the Civil Rights era that I think the book really starts being important.  Traditional history if it talks about religion and Jim Crow or Civil Rights tends to paint a fairly straight forword picture.  Noll suggests that while religion is important (and he believes that it is), it is important to different sides for different reasons.Noll suggests that post Civil War, the segregationist impulses of the Christian church still used religious language and revivalist methodology, but there was a shift and by the Civil Rights era, defense of segregation was mostly using very little scriptural support.  Similarly, prior to the Civil War, almost no abolitionist pointed to scripture to defend the equality of Black humanity (because there was a wide spread belief that Blacks were literally a separate and a sub-human species.)  But as African American churches became independent and started mining the depths of scripture for themselves, a new story emerged that a racially insensitive White majority slowly became aware of.Noll points out that the institutions of Christianity may not have been supportive of Civil Rights, but they were also not supportive of segregation either.  There was very real problems of socially integrating White and Black culture that had been separate.And so Noll suggests that the modern political history needs to be viewed through the Civil Rights movement to properly understand it.  It is not as much that the separation between the Republican White Evangelicals and the Democratic African Americans are theologically separate, but politically separate as a response to the movements of the Civil Rights era.  And while the Civil Rights era cannot be properly told without the African American church, the continued separation is not primarily theological, but historical.This is a VERY brief retelling of Nollâ€™s own brief book.  So I really skimmed over most of Nollâ€™s argument.  At the end of the book, Noll has a brief theological response.  And I think that Noll is both hopeful, but has strong words for the church, and government, about how the role of how race influences both theology and political leanings.  Ignoring that influence continues to keep Christians separate.I donâ€™t think this is Nollâ€™s best book.  He is clearly moving outside some of comfort zones and he is a bit uncomfortable with the brevity of his argument.  But it is a good introduction to areas that are often skimmed over or not given sufficient weight. The Story of the United States cannot be told without the Christian Church.  And the story of the United States cannot be told without the very mixed role that race has played.  More often than not, there was a combination of Race and Religion that was really at the root of the US story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RNQLSGLP3K4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E7FIDU#wasThisHelpful","R1RNQLSGLP3K4P","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Narnia books, and maybe Screwtape Letters or Mere Christianity, is all that many know of CS Lewis. I am far from a Lewis scholar, but I have read books over 20 books by or about Lewis over the last 3 or so years. I continue to gain insight into Lewis as I read different perspectives.Rowan Williams in his 2011 Holy Week lectures talked about Lewis and Narnia and how both can speak to our Christian lives. This book is the result of those lectures (similar to his later book, Being Christian that I read earlier this year.)I did not realize until I was done that this was based on a series of lectures. This did not feel at all like a series of lectures, but like a planned book.What I most appreciated about this book was its generous nature. Williams illustrated well what it means to read with the intention of giving the author the benefit of the doubt. Especially the chapter about Narniaâ€™s critics, but also throughout the book, Williams wants to make sure we are not unfair to Lewis and his time or what Lewis was attempting.Williams also keeps the focus on how Lewis is trying to communicate faith to his audience. There is clear wonder here. Williams himself read Narnia as a boy and while he has grown and is a scholar, he has not outgrown the desire to see wonder in literature.Rowan Williams has also done his homework. This is a book that does not limit itself just to Narnia. He quotes freely and frequently, but appropriately, from the full range of Lewisâ€™ work.Like other good books on Lewis, it makes me to want to read more Lewis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCV7XQE6EGW66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199975736#wasThisHelpful","RCV7XQE6EGW66","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a ton of books on prayer. About a year ago, some book that I donâ€™t remember suggested that we as Christians should stop reading about things we are not prepared to put into practice immediately (because it can inoculate us against actual change.) So I have tried, somewhat successfully, to lay off of Christian Living books and focus on Christian history, biography, informational non-fiction and fiction. Roughly 2/3 of the books I have read this year have been either fiction or Christian History/Biography.But after virtually universal 5 star reviews, when I saw Prayer by Tim Keller as an audiobook on Scribdâ€™s subscription program I picked it up. It would have been a very different read if I had not just read Rowan Williamsâ€™ book on CS Lewis and Narnia. Williams was such a good example of generous reading that I really was conflicted about how often I was frustrated by this book.I want to start positively. Toward the end of the book there is a significant section about prayers of repentance and confession. I do not think I have ever read a general book on prayer that also spent time on confession and repentance, and Keller did it well. I was convicted, but also I think Keller did a great job helping to illustrate what it means to truly repent.That was followed up by an even better practical section on how to actually pray and put into practice the theological reflections of the majority of the rest of the book. It was practical, still based in theological understanding of what we are doing and why we are doing it, and I think what many were probably looking for when they picked up the book. The problem is that many of the people that were looking for the practical prayer suggestions, probably did not make it to the end of the book.Much of the rest of the book was also helpful but it was not without frustration. Keller is known for being a likable and irenic pastor. He has a significant role at the Gospel Coalition, a group that is not known for being irenic.I was encouraged when Keller quoted three different catholics in the first chapter. It is clear that Keller has read widely on prayer. But I was disappointed though that throughout the book when Keller moves into a teaching mode, his quotes tend to be from John Owen, Martin Luther, John Calvin or occasionally Augustine. It felt to me, and maybe I am just not being a generous reader, that teaching roles in the book needed to be from â€˜safelyâ€™ Reformed or Reformed Friendly theologians.One of my favorite books on prayer is Richard Fosterâ€™s classic that is also simply called Prayer. Both survey the wide range of prayer that is a part of a variety of Christian traditions. While Foster is content to just survey and speak of the benefits of different types of prayer, Keller feels the need to evaluate different types of prayer. According to Keller prayer is best when it is word based (he is not a fan of centering prayer or other apophatic prayer traditions) and he is concerned that short repetitive prayers like the Jesus Prayer (Lord, Jesus, son of God, have mercy on me a sinner) can be misused by becoming mantras or incantations.So while Foster would point out how a prayer could be misused, Keller seems to suggest that a prayer type that he is not in favor of should be avoided completely instead of used properly.I may have understood Kellerâ€™s position too harshly. He repeatedly lays out a path and give illustrations of what veering too far one way or another looks like. He is attempting to keep to the balanced middle. That is more my personality, but in prayer I am just not sure that is a helpful position. Prayer is in large part Godâ€™s work that we participate in. If we feel called to a particular type of prayer, it is worthwhile to understand how that type of prayer can be misused, but we should not be rejecting the work of the Spirit if the Spirit is calling us, just because some people misuse a particular type of prayer.Kellerâ€™s definition of prayer did not help. Keller defines prayer as a â€œpersonal, communicative response to the knowledge of Godâ€. This allows Keller to account for the universal nature of prayer, without needing to say that all prayer is either the same or equally valid. The problem is that he seems to be suggesting that right theological (academic) knowledge is essential to right prayer.However, most of the people I have known that are praying saints are not theologically trained. They are orthodox Christians, but there is not enough nuance for me to be clear what Keller means when he says that that right knowledge of God leads to better practice of prayer. This seems to be a part of his reformed bias toward theological correctness as most important (and minimizing fruits of the spirit or other manifestations of the Christian life that are not academic or theological).Keller explicitly says that he is not writing anything new here. His intention is to take what is good and important from many of the classics on prayer and make it accessible to modern readers. I support the goal, but maybe not the actual way it is worked out here. Keller is incessantly quoting. I understand that he does not want to portray otherâ€™s ideas as his own. But the method makes this seem much more like a textbook than is necessary.My final point is that prayer, more than any other spiritual discipline I know, is something that must be done. Preferably with mentoring and/or in a group. Near the end of the book Keller talks about the Book of Common Prayer and how Cranmer was attempting to create a liturgy that was for the laity, soaked in scripture, with prayer as a central part, so that a culture of prayer and worship could be absorbed into the people.This is one reason that I think that James KA Smithâ€™s work has been so important at helping us Christians understand how worship helps to form us into Christ-like creatures. It is repetition and habit over time that help us be transformed. It is not in the end simply better knowledge or even wisdom that leads to a transformed life. (Smith uses the helpful phrase, we are not brains on a stick.) But it is practice (and repetition of the spiritual life and liturgy of worship) that opens us up to wisdom that helps speak into our lives through the Holy Spirit that creates transformed Christians.I do not want to suggest that this is not a helpful book. There were many sections that were helpful. I think something about the conception of the book missed the mark. It is too intellectually focused (and I say that as someone that I think it too intellectually focused on my Christian life.) It is too oriented toward right theology over and against right practice. It is too focused on the Reformation theologians and not enough on those known as people of prayer throughout Christian history. It is also fairly disjointed trying to cover a wide swath of material without fully connecting all the pieces to the whole.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHORVKW0JGIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXGIO#wasThisHelpful","RQHORVKW0JGIT","A3AQP2VX0TJQ73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AQP2VX0TJQ73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A warm loving tribute to John Ford, the making of ""The Quiet Man"" and to Ireland.For ""Quiet Man"" fans, probably the ultimate companion piece to the movie with clips from the film (could have been more pristine), knowledgeable comments from directors Martin Scorsese, Jim Sheridan and Peter Bogdanovich,  Professor William Dowling and noted Ford biographer Joseph McBride.  A revisit to many of the original locations especially the town of Cong which substituted for the film's ""Innisfree"" including meeting some of the townsfolk who worked on the film and others who remember when ""Hollywood came to town.""The saga of how John Ford battled for more than twenty years to achieve his love ode  to his ancestral home of Connemara and his eventual shrewd deal with Herbert J. Yates (head of Republic Pictures) is well documented  and Pappy's cranky quirkiness is lovingly recounted, especially by star Maureen O'Hara.Lots of little things about the film regularly pop up to surprise and delight all those who love the film, especially those of us who have more than an ample share of the green running through our veins.There are a number of bonus materials included as extras on the disc although there is nothing particularly significant except for an extended O'Hara interview.For those interested in learning more about  ""The Quiet Man"", may I suggest the fascinating, superbly researched  book ""The Complete Guide to The Quiet Man"" by Des MacHale (briefly seen in the documentary, hosting a bus tour of the sites) and published by The Appletree Press in Belfast. A large scale book filled with comprehensive detail on every aspect of the film including the pre-expanded version of Maurice Walsh's original story, more than 150 photos and maps, interviews and a unique minute by minute timing of all the scenes.  If you love the film, this is a must have book and well worth searching second hand bookshops or specialist cinema and Irish shops for.

"Oscar voters were set quite a dilemma in deciding which Alexandre Desplat nominated film score should win the 2014 Academy Award.  In the end, his rollicking, enchanting score for ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" won out but his other contribution for ""The Imitation Game"" couldn't have been far behind and would have been just as worthy as winning the accolade.This is obviously a much more serious score dealing with the complexities of Alan Turing's mathematical genius and life as a social outcast, set mainly during World War II with Turing's task of breaking the Enigma code which would be a significant event in the eventual Allies victory.Apparently Desplat  only had two and half weeks to compose this exciting score.  A truly remarkable achievement from this brilliant composer as he has successfully captured the scope of WWII and the London blitz to superbly exploring the delicate inner mind of Turing.  From the director Morten Tyldum in the liner notes: ""He had to compose the music of a tender romance, but also a tense and dangerous espionage thriller.

"Whatever the real truth behind this fascinating story dealing with Lillian Hellman and her friendship with Julia and assisting her with anti-Nazi resistance work in pre-war Germany and Austria, no one can deny the sheer storytelling power and brilliance of this superbly crafted  Fred Zinnemann, one of the truly great movies of the seventies.  As per the Mary McCarthy allegations that Hellman fabricated many of the events in this segment of her ""Pentimento"" memoir, the bitter rivalry between the two writers is a matter worth pursuing away from this brilliant film..Impeccable acting by Jane Fonda (Hellman), Vanessa Redgrave (Julia), Jason Robards  (Dashiell Hammett) and Maximilian Schell (Johann, the messenger) - all of whom won Oscars or critics awards for their flawless performances under the guidance of one of the truly great craftsmen of the cinema Zinnemann, directing what would be his next to last film.This is classic storytelling and masterful filmmaking from Alvin Sargent's Oscar winning screenplay with its multi faceted characters and superbly etched dramatic situations to the  stunning location photography of Douglas Slocombe, the brief but telling Georges Delerue music score and perfectly realized production design of the period (apparently Zinnemann used three different designers to create the essential look for each location).A brilliant, richly detailed and thought provoking drama.

"A generally interesting slice of history, current affairs, sports and trivia, this collection of ten Universal-International newsreels were produced fortnightly and cover the period from January 1951 through to June 1951.These newsreels narrated in excellent fashion, mainly by Ed Herlihy, were an important movie going experience in the days before television newscasts became the norm, thus giving the average citizen an insight (albeit selected) into world events.  The latter get well covered especially due to the Korean conflict and the general phobia of ""Reds"" taking over the world.  Scary scene of napalm bombs being introduced into the war, a forerunner to the nightmare known as the Vietnam war some years later.  Harry M. Truman, U.S. President of the period is featured prominently with the plain speaking statesman a natural in front of the camera, especially announcing the dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur.A few snippets of natural disasters, a terrible fire in Quebec, fashions of the day and sporting trivia (a lot of boxing and snow skiing items for some reason) make up the 71 minutes of this deserved budget release.

"A mixed bag of vintage Toby Ross gay adult features in this two-disc collection. Produced in 1982-83 in the era of pre-condom sex and pre-razor men; a time when the participants looked more like they had been plucked from the street than from a week of flexing in some fashionable gym.The first film ""The Diary"" is the weaker of the two, suffering from being two ""indoors"" and lacking the casual humor and zaniness of the best Toby Ross offerings.  The sex is more than adequate and what star Jake Stryker lacks in personality (including a dull voice over), he certainly makes up for as an enthusiastic performer in the bedroom, taking on some impressive duties.  This film was lengthened for theatrical release at the time which was unfortunate as the added scene with a couple of irrelevant characters in a gym seems totally out of synch with the rest of the film.""The Last Surfer"" is Ross at his best.  Very much a companion piece to ""Cruisin' 57"" right down to fast cars, hip guys, groovy clothes and credible storyline.  This is California beach boy stuff set in the mid-60's, a carefree time about to change forever with the shadow of the Vietnam war threatening.  Lots of well done outdoor scenes to compliment the indoor action.  Boyish Jeff Folger is surely one of Toby's cutest stars and performs with relish alongside seasoned performers Michael Christopher and Daniel Halt.  The highlight of this little gem is the terrific soundtrack of hits of the day which cleverly interact with the action on the screen.This is the director's cut featuring a voice over with references to the long lost days of the sixties especially the Vietnam war, sound effects (could have done with less of those ""natural"" sounds during oral sex!) and some significant editing changes (especially during jockstrapped  Folger's erotic dream) from a Blue Pictures version released some years ago.Extras in this set includes lots of trailers and the charismatic Toby Ross on-screen memories on the making of the films.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368CVYLUFWFPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPFQBH2#wasThisHelpful","R368CVYLUFWFPT","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An early Hammer horror and easily of the best and most successful entries from this famous British studio with its unique take on distinctly original exploitation features.Aided by the wonderfully atmospheric color photography by Jack Asher, the creative sets of Bernard Robinson and James Bernard's strident, chilling music score, this brisk 82-minute retelling of the Dracula story is a classic example of what can be achieved on a small budget, in this case less than a one hundred thousand pounds.Under the sure hand of two of the foremost talents of Hammer, director Terence Fisher and writer Jimmy Sangster, ""Dracula"" provides more than its share of chills, thrills and sex, earning the wrath of the British censor (""X"" certificate) and blue-nosed critics, and no doubt enhancing its box-office success.A fine cast with Christopher Lee commanding as a very imposing, frightening and sexual Dracula, matched all the way by Peter Cushing's masterful performance as the meticulous Van Helsing.

"Towards the end of the silent era, King Vidor directed this delightful, very funny satire on early Hollywood featuring Marion Davies.It's one of the tragedies of Hollywood history that Davies has been stigmatized by her association with William Randolph Hearst and somewhat parodied in ""Citizen Kane"" because she was an exceptionally fine comedienne as shown in this terrific film.  Her portrayal of country lass Peggy Peppy aiming to be a fine dramatic actress but finds herself an unexpected hit in slapstick comedy before becoming the vain Patricia Pepoire in ""respectable high class"" melodramas is first rate.  William Haines, who would later quit movies to become a distinguished interior designer is equally good as Peggy's comic and neglected partner Billy.A wonderful send-up of Hollywood in its infancy, this silent (with original music score) also boasts great cameos and walk-ons by a long list of film luminaries including Charlie Chaplin, Elinor Glyn, William S. Hart, Douglas Fairbanks, John Gilbert, Mae Murray and even Vidor and Davies playing themselves in some very funny moments.And there is a great supporting cast with  scene stealing performances by Harry Gribbon  as the ""comedy director"", Sidney Bracy as the ""dramatic director"" and Dell Henderson as Colonel Pepper.An excellent finale to his outstanding career as a director of many silent classics,  Vidor would move on to an equally distinguished career as a director of many fine ""talkies"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBPUTEG7QEJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085A9K3K#wasThisHelpful","RSBPUTEG7QEJ9","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beautiful two-time Oscar winning music  (Best Original Score, Best Song; 1940) to Walt Disney's timeless classic ""Pinocchio"" has been released in many variations through the years.This current double disc not only has the complete score but some added bonuses to make this a worthy collectors item.

"This British series produced in 1954-1955 by ITV  (syndicated in the U.S. in 1957) is a real curiosity piece.  Based on Carter Dickson's (John Dickson Carr) book  ""The Department of Queer Complaints"", Boris Karloff, in his first television series, plays Colonel Perceval Clovis Adelbart March, head of the Scotland Yard department solving strange cases.  This allows for some unusual storylines which make up these four presented in this budget Alpha release.  Unusual but nothing very distinctive except for Mr. Karloff's masterful performance - just his suave appearance, beautiful tone of voice and whimsical approach to the cases he investigates is enough to consider collecting this item.Some interesting supporting players in these episodes:  Dagmar (Dana) Wynter, Patricia Owens, Arthur Hill and would you believe, the director of such classics as ""Darling"", ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""The Day of the Locust"", John Schlesinger in a small role as a Dutch ship's captain in the episode ""Death and the Other Monkey"" !!Be aware that this Alpha transfer to DVD is pretty bodgy.  It is quite watchable but as these episodes appeared to have been transferred from American television broadcasts of many years ago,  they are a long, long way from being anywhere near pristine.  Mind you I doubt even ITV have the originals in their vaults!  So these might be the best we will ever see of this quaint mystery program of the fifties.As a footnote, there were 26 episodes produced of ""Colonel March"" between December 1954 and Spring 1955 for television with three pilot episodes (credited to director Cy Endfield and writer Leo Davis) combined into a 70 minute feature ""Colonel March Investigates"", released in British cinemas in 1953.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N5PU2GSACUJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFPR5UM#wasThisHelpful","R3N5PU2GSACUJM","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don't dismiss this autobiography by Sophia Loren, thinking it maybe just another self indulgent exercise by a screen super star.  This is a fine memoir, beautifully constructed and written and is a wonderfully entertaining book, especially concerning post war Italian cinema.  Loren captures all the necessary elements of her amazing life and career as an actress.  Love of family is at the foremost and she benefitted enormously from the strong family of women in her life, groing up during the tumultuous times of war torn and poverty stricken Naples. .Her early career, appearing in beauty pageants, as ""queen"" of magazine photo-romances, as a Cinecitta extra before being ""discovered"" by Carlo Ponti and hitting the big-time in a series of Italian classics by maestro Vittorio de Sica  (""Gold of Naples"", Oscar-winning performance in ""Two Women"" and with Marcello Mastroianni in ""Boccaccio 70"" and ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"") and a host of international hits including ""Boy on a Dolphin"", ""Houseboat"" and ""El Cid"". are all nicely covered in this highly readable memoir.Nothing too scandalous or controversial and certainly no mean spirited tales of her many collaborators during a long and momentous career.  She does cover extensively her and Ponti's battles with the Italian legal system re their marriage and tax evasion, including her brief stint in an Italian prison.Lots to treasure here including wonderful reminisces of the golden age of Italian cinema with charming vignettes of de Sica, Marcello, Fellini, Toto, Scola and Wertmuller.  And of course the international set including Chaplin, Brando, Sinatra, Grant, Peck and Altman to mention a few.  And packed full of awesome family memories, making Carlo, Mammina, Maria and sons Carlo Jr. and Edoardo feel very much part of our own extended families.A gracious Sophia.  A marvellous career and a rich rewarding life, still beautiful in every degree.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TD9CXBGZ1SXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476797420#wasThisHelpful","R3TD9CXBGZ1SXK","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The high standard of first rate gay themed dramas coming our way these days deserves to be lauded.  The Hungarian film ""Land of Storms"" is another fine example of a film that can be enjoyed and appreciated on many levels and provides very satisfying fare for the discerning viewer. I hesitated with my * rating as in my opinion falls between **** and ***** but I'm going for the higher as I think this film deserves a wide audience.Promising footballer Szabolcs gives his German team the flick after disagreements and returns to the Hungarian countryside for solitude and the task of rebuilding an old farmhouse he inherited from his grandfather.  Very much a loner until he encounters a local lad Aron who helps him with the rebuilding, only to find their attraction to each other transcends into a sexual relationship.  Aron is torn between caring for his disapproving sick mother and the homophobic abuse from the village boys with his ever reliant love and desire for Szabolcs.  Matters become even more complicated when old soccer buddy Bernard arrives in town to reignite his love for Szabolcs, creating a very difficult triangle for the boys.Complex characters in generally inhospitable surroundings are portrayed in a wonderfully realistic style by an excellent cast.  An absorbing story, excellently directed by Adam Csaszi from a fine script by the director and Ivan Szabo.  All technical credits are top notch, making this film an excellent, thoughtful drama.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZRGAIFJWDC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWFM9IG#wasThisHelpful","R1KZRGAIFJWDC8","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A thoroughly entertaining read in what should be the last word on the infamous William Desmond Taylor murder in 1922 Hollywood.I was familiar with the one of the previous accounts via the Sidney Kirkpatrick version (""A Cast of Killers"") which heavily relied on distinguished director King Vidor's research papers who was a living witness during these turbulent times.William Mann's account which takes in a much broader scope of the period and many, many more personalities and diversions is impressively researched and captures the film business of the time in detailed, almost epic style.  He comes up with different solutions and a different guilty party, all very convincingly, to the Kirkpatrick/Vidor version.At times I got a little put off by some of the writing and assumptions, particularly by the author's obvious dislike of Adolph Zukor and while his observations of the old Paramount tycoon may have been correct but continual references to him as ""old creepy"" became rather tiresome.Whilst not criticizing Mann's portrayal of early Hollywood, I wonder if any of us can really comprehend this tumultuous time in show business. Suddenly in a blink, actors, directors, producers et al, many barely speaking English, some poorly educated, were suddenly catapulted into the public spotlight and  blessed with unimaginable fame and fortune.  A nice position to be in but were these people psychologically and physically suited to cope with this rapid transition with wisdom and grace?  It makes me wonder and  I now tend to look back on those crazy times with perhaps a little more understanding than I once did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTIO7KWGDRQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242164#wasThisHelpful","R2QTIO7KWGDRQT","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Produced at J. Arthur Rank's Gainsborough Studios in 1947, this five-part children's serial is extremely well made and a lot of fun.The highlight is seeing Tony (later Anthony) Newley's  very assured and likable screen debut as Dusty Bates, a stowaway on his sailor uncle's ship who discovers a jewel smuggling racket, unbeknown to the ship's captain played by the estimable Bernard Lee.  A very young looking sixteen at the time, it is not difficult to understand why David Lean perfectly cast him as the Artful Dodger in his classic film version of ""Oliver Twist"" a year later.Newley gets a lot of solid support in this film with the other two featured juveniles effectively played by Billie Brook and Michael McKeag and the usual contingent of fine British character actors. Apart from the ever reliable Lee, there is the typical middle class mum of the period (Grace Arnold), Dusty's uncle (Wally Hatch) and his seafaring mate (Ronald Shiner)  and amongst the villains, Ralph Truman and John Longden.A bit thin on plot but with a thrill packed final chapter, this serial makes excellent use of location filming around the London docks and I presume the Islington Studios of Gainsborough (which was once a power station) came in handy for the warehouse scenes, etc.  Sadly Rank closed this old studio down in 1950.Thanks to Alpha Video for resurrecting this ""lost"" post-war children's entertainment which even us older kids can still enjoy.  The print is more than presentable;  no restoration (if that was ever possible!) or extras from this budget label.  A bargain at less than six bucks!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8IFFDM6H3L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVJZ4OA#wasThisHelpful","R1K8IFFDM6H3L7","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A novelized version of a murky chapter in U.S. naval history.  An insidious and pointless task to recruit and train sailors into a special force to lure other sailors and  particularly in this case, a Newport R.I. clergyman,  in an effort to instigate charges of perversion against their victims.Presumably a forgotten episode of gay history (it did get three lengthy paragraphs in the Randy Shilts mammoth  history of gays and lesbians in the U.S. military: ""Conduct Unbecoming""), until the author chanced upon the events and we should be grateful he has enlightened us with a very readable and interesting book.Fleshing out obscure characters and mixing real-life incidents into a novel has many pitfalls but I think the author has successfully achieved his purpose.I did find it lost a bit of momentum towards the end but overall it worked pretty well and deserves wide readership as this tragic event needs to be remembered.  For once, considering the secretive and frequently unjust military treatment of this type of case, this incident did reach a reasonably happy conclusion.  Although I doubt if any of the participants ever fully recovered from the scars inflicted during these ugly and foolish times of nearly a century ago.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15QUL4MTUGSBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477825452#wasThisHelpful","R15QUL4MTUGSBH","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the added charm of some Swiss yodelling and Gregorian chants and the persuasive use of unique instruments such as the cymbalom, balalaika and alpenhorn, Alexandre Desplat has created a rollicking, enchanting and utterly gorgeous music score to compliment Wes Anderson's latest quirky gem, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"".All the tracks on this CD are universally delightful (especially the lovely ""Mr. Moustafa"" theme) and are a credit to the versatility and brilliance of the composer and this rich and beautifully realized score thoroughly deserved the Academy Award and overdue Oscar recognition for Desplat.A handful of the 32 selections come directly from traditional sources including the wonderful ""The Linden Tree"" and ""Kamarinskaya"" expertly performed by the Osipov State Russian Orchestra.With the loss of so many legendary composers  (Bernstein, Goldsmith, Barry, Delerue and Jarre) in recent years, many of us though the era of great film composing  was well and truly over.

"Wow! I was so impressed by this brilliant Dutch film I watched it twice before writing a review.  Simply a stunning coming of age story detailing the blossoming love between two high school track athletes, ""Boys"" deserves the highest praise.Director Mischa Kamp has superbly captured the many moods of a teenage boy coming to terms with his sexuality.  Gijs Blom is exceptional in the difficult role of Sieger, a brooding 15 year old dealing with a complex home life, stating that he is ""not gay"" but being overwhelmed by his feelings for Marc.  The latter, a colorful and outgoing free spirit played with remarkable sensitivity by Ko Zadvilet, who coming from a very open family, has difficulty in understanding Sieger's mixed messages about his sexuality.  The whole cast is nothing short of superb, none more than the touching performance of Jonas Smulders as Sieger's widowed father, trying to make a good home for his two sons.Everything about this film is spot on.  From the sensitive direction and intelligent, realistic screenplay to Melle Van Essen's faultless photography of the beautiful Dutch countryside and the fantastic pop music score by Rutger Reinders.Less than eighty minutes in running time but every moment of this uplifting gay romance is precious and beautifully put together.  A feel good movie for sure, but one with substance and intelligent observation.P.S.  Even the running/athletic scenes in this film look real and are entertainingly well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5K0G8E9WBVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PV17Z7E#wasThisHelpful","R3E5K0G8E9WBVB","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A superb collection of ""film noirs"", five from Universal and an equal number from Paramount and apart from the 1958 ""Touch of Evil"", all made in the classic and appropriately black and white era of the forties.Probably only a few outright classics (""Double Indemnity"", ""The Killers"" and ""Touch of Evil"") but all wonderfully well made and intriguing from beginning to end.  Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", one of the all time greats and the Orson Welles more recently reconstructed and rediscovered gem ""Touch of Evil"" both get a single disc while the other eight films are scattered across the other four, two to a disc.  These two are the only ones with significant extras and they are substantial with ""Indemnity"" containing three audio commentaries and a first rate 40 minute documentary. Two separate commentaries accompany ""Evil"" with one featuring the stars Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh and there a couple of short ""making of"" featurettes.All the films in this collection are stacked with interest, fascination and excitement and they all range from better than good to excellent. They all contain the fine Hollywood craftsmanship of the time, move with style and pace and have storylines which will have you engrossed throughout.From the stunning debut and early film career of Alan Ladd (matched with the intriguing Veronica Lake) in ""This Gun For Hire"",  ""The Glass Key"" and  ""The Blue Dahlia"" to the powerful screen presence of Burt Lancaster in ""The Killers"" (an astonishing debut performance opposite Ava Gardner) and ""Criss Cross"", these films won't disappoint.  The two Lancaster films were directed by one of the best, if not the best, film noir directors Robert Siodmak, and he is also represented by the 1944 gem ""Phantom Lady"".  This was the real discovery for me: a fantastic thriller with an excellent Ella Raines and with a limited budget, just marvel at the way Siodmak has created it with such marvellous, inventive and stylish filmmaking.  And the unforgettable scene where Elisha Cook Jr. reaches an orgasmic fury during a drum solo is priceless!To round out this collection, Ray Milland does battle with a couple of newspaper tycoons (the sticky, slimy Charles Laughton and George Macready) in the complicated but fascinating ""The Big Clock"" with Elsa Lanchester as an eccentric painter stealing every scene she's in.  And Roy William Neill getting a break from all those Universal Sherlock Holmes programmers, with ""Black Angel"", beautifully made with a fine performance from Dan Duryea in one of his more sympathetic roles.An appreciation of fine filmmaking during the studio factory years with not only fine directors and actors but terrific writers (eg Raymond Chandler, W.R. Burnett, Albert Maltz, Jonathan Latimer, Anthony Veiller), outstanding cinematographers (eg John F. Seitz, Russell Metty, Franz Planer) and great music composers  (eg Miklos Rozsa, Victor Young, Henry Mancini) all in collaboration to create  top of the list movies for art and entertainment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNKJLW7LMRDPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUNSV3S#wasThisHelpful","RNKJLW7LMRDPU","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can't go wrong with this nifty collectors box containing eighteen scores, two to a disc, featuring most of Mancini's memorable film music from 1960 - 1978.

All the LP album cover notes are included (although a magnifying glass might come in handy with some of the small print!) and even a few extra pieces of poster art.For Mancini collectors who would like to go one step further, it should be noted that Intrada has recently released vastly extended and complete original soundtracks for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Charade"" and ""Hatari!"".

"The annual pictorial and statistical record of the movie season as compiled by John Willis brings, in volume 21, the films of 1969.  And what a great year for movies!  The output of films clearly indicated the changing times, the end of the so-called ""angry decade"".In my opinion the two best films were both directed by Englishmen:  John Schlesinger's outstanding ""Midnight Cowboy"", the first X rated film to win the Academy Award and a movie that captured the times so perfectly and with two simply great performances by Jon Voight  and Dustin Hoffman leading a fascinating cast of characters.  The other great was Lindsay Anderson's ""if ...."" a magnificent,  surreal portrayal of rebellion in an ""upper class"" British boys school with a remarkable performance by Malcolm McDowell.  Other fine films included Sam Peckinpah's revolutionary ""The Wild Bunch""; Paul Newman and Robert Redford forever immortalized as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" a film which also boasted George Roy Hill's fine achievement as director, Conrad Hall's sublime photography and Burt Bacharach's wonderful music; Sydney Pollack's powerful and gritty ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" with Jane Fonda unforgettable; Arlo Guthrie in the unique ""Alice's Restaurant"" directed by Arthur Penn;  a great young cast of up and comers in Frank Perry's thought provoking ""Last Summer""; Maggie Smith brilliant in her first Oscar winning role as Miss Jean Brodie and John Wayne riding off into the sunset with an Oscar for ""True Grit"".Lots of fine directing debuts;  Dennis Hopper and the box office sensation  of alienated youth, ""Easy Rider""; Paul Mazursky and the swinging ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"", Michael Ritchie with his ""Downhill Racer"", Bob Fosse adapting the hit stage musical ""Sweet Charity"" featuring an excellent Shirley MacLaine,  Alan J. Pakula's touching ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" with a superb Liza Minnelli, ace cinematographer Haskell Wexler's turn at directing as well with ""Medium Cool"" and Richard Attenborough's sadly neglected version of Joan Littlewood's monumental stage revue  of World War I which through songs and vignettes told us of the foolishness of that war in ""Oh! What a Lovely War"".Along with more than 1000 photographs from all the domestic and foreign releases for the year,  Mr. Willis also lists the Top Box Office Stars, Academy Awards, Promising Newcomers, Biographical Data on Film Actors and Obituaries.

"To me, the seventies was the last great decade of filmmaking and the films produced in 1971 and catalogued in this latest volume of ""Screen World"" bears fruit to that claim.  A great listing of quality films from all over the world including:  Stanley Kubrick's controversial and brilliant masterpiece ""A Clockwork Orange"",  Bernardo Bertolucci's stylish political thriller ""The Conformist"" (with incredible photography by Vittorio Storaro), Peter Bogdanovich's adaptation of decaying small town America with ""The Last Picture Show"" boasting an ensemble cast par excellence and William Friedkin's superbly directed and acted crime thriller ""The French Connection"" with the fascinating duel between Popeye (Gene Hackman) and Frog One (Fernando Rey).Other notables: Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland in the edgy, suspense filled ""Klute"", Dustin Hoffman in Sam Peckinpah's brutal ""Straw Dogs"", Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson squaring off in ""Mary, Queen of Scots"",  Clint Eastwood's debut as a director with ""Play Misty for Me"",  Julie Christie and Warren Beatty heating up the frigid conditions in Robert Altman's beautifully shot ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", the first rate musical ""Fiddler on the Roof"" (even without Zero), George C. Scott in Paddy Chayefsky's satire ""The Hospital"", coming of age in ""Summer of 42"",  Murray Head sharing more than a kiss with both Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson in ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"",  Dirk Bogarde finding beauty and death in Venice and foreign-language Oscar winner ""The Garden of the Finzi-Continis"" featuring the stunning Dominique Sanda.All these wonderful films along with all the other domestic and foreign releases  are all featured in the latest volume by John Willis and one that all serious film buffs and collectors need to have in their library.  Plus the usual features: Top Box Office Stars, Promising Newcomers (incl. Al Pacino), Academy Award Winners, Biographical Data and Obituaries.  All very nicely collected in one compact 256 page book containing more than 1000 black and white photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADTURDWZLG41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LNNX3W#wasThisHelpful","R1ADTURDWZLG41","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fine work.  Beautifully written, colorful characters, interesting and unusual setting, this new book by Denis Johnson is certain to be in the running for literary awards.  A fascinating insight into the political and social upheavals which plague many African countries and the dealings and doings of the mysterious underworld of foreign agents and mercenaries.  I must admit the story is not one of my favourite themes and had me rather confused at times but I admire the author for producing a fine work of literature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7RMD7JCNSOIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374280592#wasThisHelpful","R7RMD7JCNSOIA","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Willis has assembled another great pictorial and statistical collection, this time for the year 1972.  With a listing of all domestic and foreign-language films released and supplemental items such as Top Box Office Stars, Promising New Actors, Academy Award Winners, Biographical Data of Film Actors and Obituaries, this 254 page volume with more than 1000 great photographs is a treasure trove of information for film buffs.Any year that boasts films of the stature of the superlative Francis Ford Coppola opus ""The Godfather"" and Bob Fosse's stunning musical drama ""Cabaret"" is certainly worth celebrating.  Lots of other fine movies including a few from ""old masters"": Luis Bunuel's sublime ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"", Ingmar Bergman's stunning ""Cries and Whispers"", Alfred Hitchcock's return to his home soil with the suspense thriller ""Frenzy"".  Other notable achievements included  John Boorman's exceptional ""Deliverance"" (making a hit out of  ""Duelling Banjos""),  Martin Ritt's touching ""Sounder"" with Cicely Tyson, Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine in a fascinating tour de force which was also the final film in the illustrious career of Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Jacques Tati's ""Traffic"", the first pairing of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton (""Play it Again, Sam""), Martin Scorsese making an impression with ""Boxcar Bertha"" for the Roger Corman stable.Just a sampling of what waits in this edition of the long running series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LUQN6DAD1YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0517504154#wasThisHelpful","R10LUQN6DAD1YS","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must have been one of the few people who saw and enjoyed this ""Hitchcockian"" thriller back in 1979.  Don't know why this film didn't find an audience; some have said a poor marketing campaign and a trailer that gave the plot away as reasons.  Co-producer Michael Taylor in a very interesting on-camera interview for this DVD release denies this and like many a good film, it  just didn't click for some unknown reason.This is a very good suspense thriller, excellently directed by Jonathan Demme (twelve years later he would win Best Picture and Director Oscars for ""The Silence of the Lambs"")  and boasting strong performances from Roy Scheider and Janet Margolin.  Exciting and fast paced with an unusual plotline and featuring some superb location photography by Tak Fujimoto, this is a very enjoyable film. Loved the shots on a Connecticut railway station and the conclusion at Niagara Falls is breathtaking.  All this is played out with the assistance of another thrilling, pulsating music score by Miklos Rozsa.  It's very ""Rozsa"" - isn't that enough to excite you to another level of appreciation?The obvious references to Hitchcock are all there; Demme was not the first young director to pay homage to the ""master"".  Nods to classics like ""Vertigo"" and ""North By Northwest"" and even a Demme cameo.  Maybe there are others: ""The Birds"", ""Marnie"" to mention a couple that crossed my mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARDI2QRKEYZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBVLEBU#wasThisHelpful","RARDI2QRKEYZG","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Harold Robbins potboiler which one book critic in the NY Times claimed "" ...should have been inscribed on the walls of a public lavatory"" was a massive best seller and when filmed by Joseph E. Levine and Paramount Pictures in 1964, despite generally negative reviews was a smash hit.  Obviously based on Howard Hughes, Jonas Cord Jr. is a young millionaire industrialist and movie mogul in the early days of Hollywood fighting with his inner demons, the ups and downs of power and the many women in his life.  The film, directed by Edward Dmytryk, starred George Peppard, Alan Ladd (in his last film role playing an ageing cowboy star and Cord's surrogate father, Nevada Smith), Carroll Baker (in a Jean Harlow role), Robert Cummings, Elizabeth Ashley, Martha Hyer,  Lew Ayres and Martin Balsam.The best part of the film and the most highly praised would be Elmer Bernstein's lush and exciting score, produced during one of the musician's most prolific and rich periods.  Dominated by his main theme for Jonas Cord and using many variations, all the main character's drive and ambition, sublime arrogance and carefree manner are all perfectly portrayed by the music.  Also  major highlights are the tender love theme for Jonas and Monica (Ashley) and Bernstein's use of ""demented  piano figures to conjure the specter of madness, adding a disturbing singsong theme in airy high registers"" in exploring Cord's fear of insanity.  Bernstein also includes some dance tunes in the spirit of the times and even some of his own western music to underscore Nevada Smith's films.With this special edition, Intrada gained access to the original soundtrack scoring sessions  and on this CD, they make their world premiere with a timing of 52:33. Plus we get the original re-recorded album that Bernstein produced for his Ava label. Also included is a 20-page booklet loaded with photos (even with an alternate cover) and informative notes on the film and music by John Takis (which this reviewer took some liberty with). All in all, a very special release with more than 78 minutes of great Elmer Bernstein  music from the golden sixties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28XY78N0U3FQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8BK4I2#wasThisHelpful","R28XY78N0U3FQN","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For fans of film music and especially for admirers of the film scores of Maurice Jarre, this DVD/CD combination is a must. As the title announces, this is a concert tribute to the great director David Lean for whom Jarre composed some of his most memorable scores.  Featured are his selections from his Academy Award winning compositions: ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""A Passage to India"" as well the underrated ""Ryan's Daughter"".  All wonderful listening experiences which you can hear separately on the CD disc or watch on the DVD with Jarre conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London with the added bonus of the music being complimented by the actual film images and of Lean directing scenes. The warm admiration that Jarre has for Lean is obvious and refreshing to find two great talents on the same page. You can also watch the DVD concert with interesting and revealing comments by Jarre (in French with sub-titles) about the concert, working with Lean and the creation of film music.  An added extra is a terrific 35 minute interview conducted by Christian Lauliac in which M. Jarre discusses (in French) his long film career with insights into such personalities as Sam Spiegel, John Huston and Peter Weir as well as Lean.  Interesting to know that Spiegel chose the virtually unknown (ie outside of his native France) Jarre to score ""Lawrence"" on the basis of his ten-minute score for ""Sundays and Cybele"" and the complex issue over the conducting of the score due to British government funding.  Fascinating and rewarding and even by some weird chance you don't love his music, you'll certainly be won over by M. Jarre's candid charm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6K1FNJUTKKR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VKL6UM#wasThisHelpful","R6K1FNJUTKKR1","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All through my youth and beyond I was fascinated by the image of Peter Berlin or to be more honest, the sight of him in his always skin tight pants. Thanks to this insightful documentary, I have at last learned more about him and his career as one of the gay world's most outrageous exhibitionists. Still remarkably youthful and fit looking for someone of 70, Peter comes across as a pretty regular sort of guy who has lived a very full and satisfying life.  He apparently lived the life he wanted to as a first rate photographer (mainly of himself), mixing in arty circles in Europe and America, making a few early porn movies (with his partner Robert W. Richards, his relationship with the troubled Richards poignantly remembered by Peter) and now living modestly but with a fascinating lifetime of memories to cherish.Berlin hit his peak in the 1970s taking advantage of the new freedoms of gay sexual liberation. That incredible mop of blond hair, muscular body and sexual prowess always on display made Peter one of the most iconic figures of the gay lifestyle.  And unlike many other exhibitionists, he had the goods worth displaying whether in his tight jeans, thong, see-through tights and shorts, leather or sailor suits, most of which he designed himself. Fans of the Peter Berlin look should try and hunt down a book of his photographs. The one I have is ""The Peter Berlin Collection"", a 1990 book published in Berlin, Germany by  Janssen-Verlag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVRSG5NGX7YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FGGWJM#wasThisHelpful","R3JVRSG5NGX7YN","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Royal Shakespeare Company's marathon production ""The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby"" was the big hit of the Broadway season, winning the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and the Tony for Best Play.  Each performance of this epic adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic ran for eight and a half hours in two parts with a one hour break.  Other highlights included the award winning musicals ""Nine"" and ""Dreamgirls"".

Butterfly"" (winner of the Tony for Best Play, Actor and Director), ""Burn This"" with John Malcovich and Tony-winning Joan Allen, ""Macbeth"" starring Christopher Plummer and Glenda Jackson.  The Off-Broadway ""Driving With Miss Daisy"" won the Pulitzer and the Cole Porter musical ""Anything Goes"" scored the Tony as Best Revival.All the usual invaluable sections are in this volume including Theatre World awards, biographical data and obituaries.

"A selection of seven segments of ""Life in Hollywood"" which were shown in cinemas in 1927.  Nothing very exciting or illuminating but for people interested in the sights (no sound as these were silent films) of early Hollywood there is enough material here to entertain and amuse.  Amazing to see how many studios were operating at this time although most views appear to be from across the street or over the back fence. There are some inside shots of Universal City, Warner Bros., M-G-M and glimpses of such obscurities from the past such as  Christie Comedy Studios, Metropolitan, Educational Comedies and Pickford-Fairbanks.Lots of stars and directors on show although most studio scenes appear to be staged for the camera; obviously the attempt at keeping the mystique of Hollywood at the forefront for the audience was paramount in these short subjects.As you would expect from such an obscure collection, the picture quality is not great but more than watchable and the music soundtrack provided although a bit monotonous is in keeping with the sounds of the twenties.

"I was very young when Stanley Kramer came to town to shoot his adaptation of local writer Nevil Shute's controversial best seller ""On The Beach"".  I think this was the first big American production ever filmed in Melbourne and it's an extra bonus for a Melbourne native to look back after fifty-five years to see what the old city looked like - a very quiet sort of sleepy hollow  to what it is now, a massive metropolis bursting at the seams!  Ava Gardner made many disparaging comments about the Melbourne of 1959, much to the chagrin of Kramer, but she would be quite surprised if she saw the place now.""On the Beach"" was the second of four unforgettable masterpieces (and political statements) that Stanley Kramer made during the period of 1958-1961; the others being ""The Defiant Ones"", ""Inherit the Wind"" and ""Judgment at Nuremberg"".  The thought of nuclear warfare and possible annihilation were very real concerns for most of us around this time and will probably not have the same impact on younger audiences today.The film itself is first class drama with an excellent ensemble cast.  Gregory Peck, one of the most likable actors ever to star on the silver screen is his usual stoic self.  Ava Gardner is very good and believable as the vulnerable Moira (personally I think she  steals the film).  Fred Astaire fine in one of his best non-musical roles and Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson are exceptional as the doomed young couple.  And they all succeed pretty well with their Australian accents and thanks to Kramer, they don't sound like Aussie caricatures.  And the local talent is well represented by John Tate and Lola Brooks, both delightful, as Admiral Bridie and his loyal Lt. Hosgood respectively.One of the highlights of course is the use of the Australian folk song ""Waltzing Matilda"" which is heavily used and very effective.  According to the film's composer Ernest Gold who loathed the melody, it was at the insistence of Kramer that it be used throughout the movie.  Gold considered its use as a challenge: ""I said I'm going to call upon all my skills as a composer by variation, reharmonization, development, every musical device that I was aware of, to use that as a bit of thematic material and confine it essentially to say 'Australia'.""  Suffice to say that along with all his original music, this score won an Academy Award nomination for Mr. Gold. (The soundtrack, coupled with Gold's bouncy, Italian flavoured ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria"" is available on the Film Score label: FSM Vol.5 No.7. Highly recommended.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S30NESGGHDQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOW4B0E#wasThisHelpful","R1S30NESGGHDQM","A189VV6P4IZJXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A189VV6P4IZJXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I donâ€™t know who came up with the idea that basic health requires eight hours of sleep. The only time I slept that many hours in recent years I was recovering from surgery in a hospital and taking prescription opiates. But on a recent morning, after using Sound+Sleep Mini, I woke up and realized Iâ€™d been asleep for over ten hours. I was so surprised I wanted to get on the phone and call everybody I know.I confess to being chronically suspicious of gadgets that promise to improve my life. Iâ€™d heard of machines that create white noise or reproduce sounds from nature â€” ocean waves lapping at the shore, birds twittering, logs fireplaces crackling in a fireplace â€” all promising ideal sleep. I thought it was just some sort of aural placebo until I started using Adaptive Sound Technologyâ€™s Sound+Sleep Mini.This little device doesnâ€™t give me sound sleep every night. I havenâ€™t duplicated that 10-plus hour snooze since that first episode, but I canâ€™t dispute the fact that I am indeed sleeping more hours and more soundly than previously.Thereâ€™s really no hocus-pocus about the experience. Sound machines have been around at least since the 1960â€™s. Many families use them to lull babies to sleep by masking intrusive sounds like vehicle traffic or noisy neighbors.An article in the New York Times stated: Used correctly, these gadgets could change your life â€” you might finally get a reprieve from your snoring spouse, or vice versa; you might finally get your baby to sleep (so you can spend more time with your snoring spouse), or you might finally drown out those unashamedly loud neighbors.The Sound+Sleep Mini is different from the other devices in at least two respects.It includes ASTâ€™s proprietary listening technology that can monitor the sounds in your environment and adapt the volume of the sounds coming from the device automatically. If your bedmate is snoring, it will detect that and increase the volume of whatever sound youâ€™ve selected.Fortunately, this is only an option. I turned it off because it was intrusive. Its monitoring was so sensitive that the volume would increase at the slightest change, even sliding my alarm clock across my nightstand. But I can see how this feature will be useful if the user lives in a noisy place where barking dogs, heavy traffic, and subway trains are be a factor.The second feature, which I found to be nique, is what the company calls SoundStories. Each sound the Mini produces can be modified with the press of a button so that you end up with as many as 48 combinations of sounds. For example, if you press the button to select the ocean, youâ€™ll at first only hear only waves. Press it again and you can add seagulls, fog horns, sea lions, and more. If you select rain, you can get a drizzle or a downpour.Regardless of which sound you select, you can increase or decrease the volume to suit your comfort level.Negri noise 2The unit includes the various whirring fan sounds that made ASTâ€™s LectroFan very popular. The fan sounds, which I prefer, can be changed from a deep turbine-like sound to a small desk fan.AST says the sounds it produces do not loop. They continuously change very subtly so that they donâ€™t become monotonous. The unit also comes with a timer that allows you to leave the sound on continuously or set to stop in 30 minute increments. I usually leave mine on all night except when Iâ€™m using the rain sound. Thirty to sixty minutes of rain is enough to put me to sleep.That reminds me of a caveat you should keep in mind: If your bladder is waking you up two or three times a night, a sound machine isnâ€™t going to enable you to sleep through those natural events. Just as well, wouldnâ€™t you say?Mini also has an audio input so if you want to listen to music instead of its sounds you can use the provided 5â€™ audio cable to connect an iPod, cellphone or other device and just use the Mini as a speaker. Audio performance is very good for music and voice playback, adding value and versatility to this special-purpose product.The Sound+Sleep Mini is a quality device that is small enough to take on trips so you can use it in a hotel room.Highly recommended. Time for a long nap!MyMac Review Rating is 9 out of 10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KMTP526DYKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017HMRR68#wasThisHelpful","R17KMTP526DYKU","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maybe the best thing about this watch is the fact that it's not really a watch at all. It's a small tire on your wrist, and I think it gives me superpowers. Why? Well, wearing this super large and heavy watch seems to block the fear in me, so that even when (okay, if) I am confronted with a mugger, I'm pretty sure my Swiss Legend watch will act as a Captain America shield. I'm pretty sure it can deflect a knife strike as well as any bullets fired at me. If I do ward off the attacker, and he/she starts to run, either throwing this watch at them will knock them out, or dropping it to the ground will cause them to loose their balance when the ground shakes.Besides its offensive and defensive capabilities, it also does a great job of telling time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259P9KQMOI14Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K5F5ZU#wasThisHelpful","R259P9KQMOI14Y","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up I missed the whole Transformers thing. But my son, on the other hand, really likes them. So having the opportunity to review this product was great. That's about all the greatness there was.It's really cheap. I have purchased not a few Transformers over the years for him, and while some are complex to actually transform, they were never cheap dollar store quality toys. This one is. Which is sad, because it's a HUGE toy, but it feels like it will break quickly. Once you transform it into a car, it does not even align correctly, something my seven year old thought was pretty lame.Come on, if you're going to charge $50 for a toy, it had better be WORTH $50.

It was downright chilly last night, as an example, and my wife and I have not taken down the trampoline.

"This multi-cooker works well, but (a) it is not as large as I thought it was and (b) HOT HOT HOT. This cooker gets VERY hot in operation. Like, almost too hot to touch.

It is more complex than either my rice cooker or my much larger slow cooker, and I did need to read the instruction manual.

"When iPads first came out the thought of our kids grabbing our iPads and dropping them, such an expensive piece of electronics, left us in fear. However, as the iPad has evolved, their use in schools and at home has become generally accepted. Still, we are talking about an expensive piece of hardware, and no matter how well intentioned, or careful our kids try to be, accidents do happen.Kensington has designed the SafeGrip case for kids with just this situation in mind.The SafeGrip is made of a thick foam-like material that covers the entire iPad, except the screen and a square window in the back. This square cut out can be used to personalize the unit in multi-unit environments. It does come with a screen protector as well. â€œDesigned for kidsâ€ means a big, thick, handle to prevent drops (doubles as a stand), easily cleans up with soap and water, and even has a slot for a stylus.Since my kids are all grown up, I asked a co-worker, Marc Pessotti, who has two young children, if he wouldnâ€™t mind taking the SafeGrip out for a spin.Marc writes:The Kensington SafeGrip Case for the iPad Air 2 definitely exceeded my expectations. The case is made of a light weight foam that makes it easy to hold and did not slip off any surface I laid it down on. The case holds my iPad Air 2 firmly and the edges are well protected. The case also comes with a screen protector and visual step by step instructions to install it.I have had cases made from similar material for my iPhone 5 and those cases did not hold up well after a couple months of use. The light weight foam material began to stretch and become deformed, blocking the ports on my iPhone. With the SafeGrip Case this did not happen, and the case is still functioning well after a couple of months of use.This case is much thicker than your typical hard plastic cases and I was concerned about port accessibility. As it turns out, I was surprised and impressed with how easy it was to access  everything from the volume buttons to the headphone plug.TypeThe handle also acts as a stand for the iPad and is definitely useful, but not the most sturdy of stands. If the surface is not flat and solid, you wonâ€™t have much luck keeping the iPad upright. Being used by my 5 year old daughter, the case did get a bit dirty at times. Also, the case is easy to write on with markers and pens, but a damp cloth with just water will remove most things, including ink, fairly easy.StandThis case has held up well for over 2 months, but I am still skeptical of it lasting much more than 6 months. With all things said, I give this an 8 out of 10.The Kensington SafeGrip is available at Amazon and directly from the good folks at Kensington.MyMac Review Rating: 8 out of 10","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNLWTOLERFBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKFE91M#wasThisHelpful","RFNLWTOLERFBI","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I usually feel like Iâ€™m all thumbs when drawing on my iPad with a stylus. The tips are either soft and mushy or made of odd materials such as wire, hinged plastic, rubber, or even bristles. None are accurate enough for me. The new Stilo fine-tip stylus addresses these shortcomings.black-stilo-womanThe Stilo is 5-1/2 inches (14cm) long and is 1/2 inch (12.7mm) in diameter. The distinguishing feature of this pen is its firm, remarkably fine, 1.9mm tip. If youâ€™ve been frustrated with a blunt, rubbery-tipped stylus, youâ€™ll be impressed with the Stiloâ€™s fine, responsive tip. The drawing below is one-inch wide in the corner of an iPad Mini screen. You canâ€™t do that with a big, blunt stylus.TeenieStilo is powered by a single replaceable AAA battery that provides up to ten hours of continuous use. Insert the battery, turn it on and youâ€™re in business. A tiny LED indicates power. No pairing, no Bluetooth, just grab and go. The pen shuts itself off if it is unused for ten minutes. It has a small protective cap for the tip and is available in both a black and a white version.05_Stilo_hor_3000_bw_shadowThe Stilo pen works with almost all capacitive touch screens and will work with most screen protectors, even glass ones. The tip can be rotated to increase or decrease its sensitivity. Some screen protectors may require extra sensitivity and the pen can be adjusted to accommodate that.MaterA small whine: Creatives often complain about writing or drawing tools that are cylindrical. These tend to roll around your work surface and can even roll off your desk. If the battery cap on the top of the Stilo was hexagonal, the pen wouldnâ€™t roll away. It would also make the cap easier to unscrew when replacing the battery. Many writing instruments have pocket clips on them. They are almost never used for their intended purpose, the clips are there because they keep the pen from rolling.Stilo also makes a Precision Film for iPads (4th Gen, Air, Air 2, Mini 2 and 3) as well as for Samsung Galaxies and the Nexus 6 or 9.  All sizes are $19.99. The slightly grippy, plastic film surface provides friction that simulates the feel of pen or pencil on paper. Glass is slick and unforgiving, but I prefer it to an overlay of film. When using my fingers for gestures without the stylus, the plasticky surface of the film doesnâ€™t feel right to me. This is entirely a personal preference. If you are already accustomed to screen protectors, this may not be a concern.The Stilo is a well-made stylus whose specialty is accuracy. It is not pressure-sensitive. Youâ€™ll enjoy taking detailed notes and sketching small diagrams with this stylusâ€™ fine tip. Drawing is satisfying fun because of its responsiveness and near-zero latency.MyMac Review rating for the Stilo pen is 9 out of 10.Due to my personal preferences, I can only rate the Precision Film 7 out of 10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WS146CU26XDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYL74GY#wasThisHelpful","R2WS146CU26XDP","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Home automation and the Internet of Things arenâ€™t just pie-in-the-sky concepts any more. Theyâ€™re beginning to happen. iHomeâ€™s new iSP5 SmartPlug lets you control an electrical outlet in your home wherever you are with your iPhone. Itâ€™s also compatible with Appleâ€™s HomeKit so Siri will respond to your voice commands.Smart appliances such as thermostats, exterior door locks, and garage door openers can already be controlled by smartphones but these devices are expensive and often require professional installation. By comparison, the SmartPlug is a simple, inexpensive plug-and-play device. It connects wirelessly to your home Wi-Fi and is controlled with the iHome Control app (iOS and Android). Open the app and a single tap turns the power on or off.InHandEach SmartPlug comes with its own unique accessory code so you can have several of the devices around your home and control each individually. Because SmartPlugs are iOS compatible, you can set timers for each if desired. They can handle up to 1800 watts so larger appliances such as a window air conditioner, fan, or space heater can be controlled. Imagine the Jetson-style convenience of turning on your room air conditioner when you leave your office so your home will be comfortable when you arrive.TwoScreensIf you have several SmartPlugs installed, you can create and control Scenes. Set a Party scene where the lights go on and the music starts. Set a Prime Time scene where the TV turns on and several lights turn off. There are many flexible possibilities that are easy to set up. If you choose, you can also control zones of your house: Living room, Bedroom, Office, etc. When you are traveling, you can set lights to go on and off at times you preselect or you can do the same live from your phone.The iHome Control app allows you to add more SmartPlugs at any time. You can also add new users so both you and your spouse can control your home units. You can even set up your office so that only you can control the lighting and equipment there. The SmartPlug is designed so that two will fit, one above the other, in a standard electrical outlet.WallPlugEventually, most home automation devices will be able to communicate with each other as well as with you. Weâ€™re on the cusp of some very exciting Internet of Things technology.

"Sibelius 8Perpetual license: $599Annual subscription (new users): $239Upgrade from all previous versions (1 to 7.5) of Sibelius, including one yearâ€™s upgrades: $89 per annumSwitch from Finale, Notion, Encore, Mosaic: $199Full licensing detailsJean Sibelius, the 150th anniversary of whose birth we celebrate this year (he lived from 1865 to 1957), officially composed only seven symphonies. Certainly only seven were published. Yet fragments of an 8th do exist; and indeed were performed in 2011â€¦ barely three minutes long, though. Sibelius certainly withdrew and tried to suppress his 8th.So Avid, who have owned the iconic score-writing software, Sibelius, since 2006, were faced with a something of a quandary when naming the latest release, which followed less than a year and a half after Version 7.5. Particularly with regard to since the short musical extract which plays over the programâ€™s splash screen on loading: itâ€™s traditionally been taken from the corresponding symphony number. (As version 8 loads we hear a few swelling bars from the first movement of the Sixth.)MyMac reviewed Sibelius 7.5 a year ago, and put the continued development of the product in the context of then recent changes at Avid. Happily, the software and company have held their own. They continue to provide an excellent environment in which to compose music â€“ many orders of magnitude above what the likes of GarageBand offers. Indeed, the hundreds of third party plugins, ancillary tools and score scanning and capturing software make Sibelius still the richest option for serious composers. Some of this comes bundled with Sibelius (8) in â€˜liteâ€™ versions â€“ see the end of this review.Version 8 itself, though, offers fewer new features than other upgrade versions have done. The only major new innovation â€“ but one that will be very useful to many who work this way â€“ is the addition of integrated control and data input via other devices that the keyboardâ€¦ Annotations and gestures on a tablet etc. The other major change is in Avidâ€™s pricing structure and policy.AnnotationsSibelius has long supported notes â€“ as in written comments in English or a localized language, as well as crotchets/quarter notes and quavers/eighth notes. Such additions â€“ usually above the staff â€“ can help you find your way around, act as reminders, or prompts: â€œthis needs to be completed next sessionâ€¦â€,  â€œdiscuss tempo with players at first rehearsalâ€, â€œchange back to arcoâ€, or â€œreturn to this passage and transpose after orchestrationâ€.Sibelius version 8â€™s new Annotate feature allows you greater flexibility in drawing directly onto the score with the appropriate input device â€“ mouse, trackpad, USB tablet, (Surface Pro 3) pen etc.Sibelius 8 AnnotationsYou can now circle items, write (or type) well-formatted comments or instructions for arrangers, players or students, for instance. Theyâ€™re part of the score. And you add them using a pen â€“ with the appropriate hardware environment â€“ or a mouse/finger (though this isnâ€™t really practical). Annotations are intelligently grouped: make a few annotations within a sufficiently short time â€“ even lifting the pen off your (tabletâ€™s) surface â€“ and theyâ€™ll be bound together. And handled in such a way that theyâ€™re fixed to the bar in question. You can control the color and pen width.Annotations can be toggled on/off (Review > Annotations > Annotate) â€“ for final printing, for example; and can be cut/copied and pasted.TabletIf your workflow emulates â€“ or if you prefer to use â€“ pen-and-paper techniques, then thereâ€™s another new feature in Sibelius 8: the program now works with touch screens and tablets on which itâ€™s installed. Optimized for the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet, it allows note input and navigation through the score with the fingers, gestures, swipes and a deviceâ€™s onscreen keyboard and fretboard.Musical notes can now be input by tapping with the pen as you would click with a mouse pointer. A pen will also erase. To move around your score, touch a blank area and move your fingers. Intuitive. You can also pinch and zoom.Think long and hard about this before jumping to Version 8 on the strength of just this, though: Sibelius is such a rich environment that you can only ever do basic operations this wayâ€¦ youâ€™re always going to need a full QWERTY keyboard.Sibelius 8 GUIPricingSo itâ€™s probably the new pricing model which is the biggest change for Avid and Sibeliusâ€™ many users: while bearing firmly in mind that itâ€™s still arguably the most sophisticated, feature-rich and easiest-to-use notation suite available, the yearly $89 upgrade cost will seem high to many when the absence of major new functionality is considered.At the same time, itâ€™s to be noted that all licenses now include support which previously cost an extra $29. This means unlimited online cases, and one phone call per month as well as all software upgrades released during the term of the license. This applies until the end of June next year. Then youâ€™ll have a choice between a new perpetual license at the full-price of $599, or the renewable subscription starting at $9.99 a month (see this page), which would equate to almost six yearsâ€™ payments, by which time things are sure to have changed again.In the meantime, thereâ€™s all the more reason to stay with Sibelius and upgrade to version 8 if you believe that itâ€™s usually beneficial to have the latest version of a piece of software that you rely on, and if you also  think that Avid will have stiff competition in Steinbergâ€™s product, whose development is led by former Sibelius Product Manager, Daniel Spreadbury and so accept what Sam Butler (his successor) has saidâ€¦ that Avid has â€œa strong plan for the next few yearsâ€¦ Weâ€™re aiming for a steady release of features for Sibelius itself, including some much needed technical work under the hood as well as some attention to the notation and user experience side of the application.â€The full pricing structure (there are various combinations and options) can be found here; the usual 30-day trial period is also available.ActivationAlong with the new pricing models comes a revamp of the license activation procedureâ€¦ you now activate Sibelius on any computer by signing in to your Avid Master Account; not by user IDs and serial numbers etc. This account offers access to support, downloads and other resources.Sibelius 8 activationGiven the complexity of such a change, this worked really well in the upgrade performed â€“ independently of Avidâ€™s support team â€“ for this review. As said, the same is true of the other features â€“ new and existing â€“ in Sibelius 8.File CompatibilityIf there are no Annotations in your Sibelius 8 file, it can be opened directly in version 7.5. The ability to File > Export > Previous Version still works; and files can be saved to share or make available to users with versions all the way back to Sibelius 2. Avid does suggest that this apparent interchangeability between versions 8 and 7.5 is not to be relied on in future releases.Sibelius 8 needs Mavericks (OS X 10.9) or higher. The Sibelius 8 installer does an excellent job of transferring resources, files, and folders from previous versions.Like everything else covered in this review, it worked flawlessly.But the Sibelius forums and user groups online are always alive with those who â€“ for one reason or another â€“ prefer to stay with earlier versions, often 6, which was the last one before the hotly-debated ribbon was introduced. When MyMac looked at version 7 almost four years ago, though, and evaluated the ribbon, it was found perfectly usable; an improvement on 6 even. So an upgrade really is advisable. And preferably to Version 8 now.Scan and TranscribeAlso bundled with Sibelius version 8 (though not for the first time) are two other ways to input musical data. PhotoScore & NotateMe Lite  has a pretty good record of reading sheet music, PDFs, and even handwritten scores. You might want to base a set of variations of your own on an established theme, for example; or study Lisztâ€™s implied piano technique.Neutronâ€™s AudioScore Lite is for transcribing music from a CD, or and audio source â€“ such as  singing/playing an instrument through a microphone. The Sibelius + Ultimate Bundle has the non-â€˜Liteâ€™ versions of these.Conclusions: If you make your living from, or are a dedicated user of Sibelius, although $89 doesnâ€™t get you a great deal more than was part of Sibelius 7.5, itâ€™s worth the priceâ€¦ there are certainly bug fixes and â€˜invisibleâ€™ enhancements in Sibelius 8 that are well worth paying for. If youâ€™re cautious, you do still have almost a year to decide on your future strategy. Subscription-based pricing is certainly a trend on the increase; it does have advantages. Many users will also feel theyâ€™re more likely to get better support as a result, and need not worry about having to pay for upgrades.Pros: still the most flexible, fully-featured and reliable score notation available for OS X â€“ particularly in terms of its ability to work with third party virtual instrumentsCons: Version 8 has only one significant new feature; so it will be expensive for some users who perhaps do not use alternative input devices or gestures.System Requirements:Mac OS X 10.9 or 10.101 GB or more RAM1 GB hard disk space for Sibelius software only4 GB or more RAM recommended for the Sibelius Sounds library (technically an optional installation, but one which most users will want)36 GB (SSD preferred) additional hard disk space recommended for the Sibelius Sounds libraryOptical drive (for installation from the optional Media Pack DVDs)internet connection for software download and activationMyMac Review Rating: 9 out of 10","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9N4J8ATYE3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011346MY4#wasThisHelpful","R3O9N4J8ATYE3N","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, I am shocked that these do not include any noise-canceling technology. In fact, overall, I am somewhat disappointed in these Bose headphones.A little back story. Two decades ago, I had purchased a very expensive pair of Bose headphones. I purchased them from a high-end stereo store, and the salesman at the time (a friend) said that they were overpriced for the audio quality. ""You're buying the name"" he told me. My dad, though, had a pair of Bose speakers he had picked up on his way back from Vietnam, and I LOVED the audio quality. My friend told me I could get another pair of headphones for fifty bucks cheaper that sounded a lot better. I didn't listen, purchased the Bose, and went home to enjoy my CDs. A week later, I returned the headphones, and got the less expensive pair. (KOSS) My friend was correct after all. At that point, I swore off Bose as expensive but not as good in audio quality. I took on his mantra as my own. ""Your buying the name.""This brings us to these Bose headphones. They are the first Bose I have owned since the early 1990s. I didn't want to bias my opinion, so I went in with an open mind. Usually a fan nowadays of Shure and AKG, I was really interested to see (hear) if Bose had pushed past the ""more money for less quality""Sadly, no.The first time I started to listen to them, I was happy. They sounded pretty full, bright, and clear. They do a decent job of blocking regular sounds, but are terrible on an airplane. After an hour, though, I realized that something was off. I switch over to my normal AKGs and found out that the Bose were mudding the bass. I didn't notice at first, but the more I listened, the more noticeable it became.I REALLY wanted to like these headphones. They are very comfortable to wear, a big selling factor for me. In comfort alone, I would rank these an almost perfect score. The audio controls for your Android phone works well, but sadly does nothing in an iPhone. This is an odd choice, as I have used plenty of headphones over the last few years that control volume and pause/play just fine on both Android and iOS. Either Bose skimped on the controls, or their marketing team decided to focus on Android for... well, whatever reason.Audio quality is good, not great, and not terrible. Comfort is amazing. At this price-point, I do expect a lot better. I have a pair of $79 Harman Kardon headphones that blow these away in audio quality. And, sadly, my friend from all those years is still correct: with Bose, you are buying the hype, not the quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U42JCRW1PCUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFYYG#wasThisHelpful","R3U42JCRW1PCUN","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We lost the sugarberry. This is a little plastic food thing that goes with StarLily, and she would make fun noises when ""eating"" it. My daughter is not happy.StarLily is a very fun, somewhat interactive toy that takes four batteries, makes fun and pleasing sounds, and has become a favorite toy for my daughter. So much so, in fact, that when the sugarberry became lost, days were spent looking for it, but alas, it has yet to be found.My younger son also likes StarLily, but pretends not to. It is, after all, a flying unicorn, and boys are not suppose to like those things. At least that's what he says, even though my wife and I have told him that it's okay to like any toy, regardless if it's made for a boy or girl. Perhaps, he has asked, there is a cool Dinosaur like StarLily that he could get. Or maybe a turtle. Regardless, he really likes it as well, almost as much as my daughter, and he REALLY wants one like it.That, in and of itself, should tell you a lot about the quality and desirability of the toy. Even boys want one ;-)The toy has held up very well over the last month, especially considering how much it is played with. The horn lights up with multiple colors, it responds to your touching and talking to it, and it moves around very realistically. (I like how it blinks it's eyes) There is an iPad app that goes along with it, but my daughter has not gotten around to using it with StarLily yet. The app is free on the iTunes store.All in all, this is a great toy, and while pricey, I think it's well worth it for the enjoyment my daughter (and secretly son) has gotten out of it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTEU367O5EN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4W56#wasThisHelpful","RFTEU367O5EN2","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Printing Bliss! That's the only way to describe my time using the Epson WorkForce ET-4500.The big news here is the cost of replacing the ink. Unlike the price of replacement ink in the past, you just refill the ""tanks"" on this new printer. And it takes a LOT more ink than before, but at half the price. This is a big deal, bigger than the tech press is giving it. For the past fifteen years, it cost almost as much to buy a new printer as it would be to buy the replacement ink. With the WorkForce ET-4500, Epson is changing this business model, and it is a massively welcome change!On to the printer itself.It's hard to find any faults with this machine. It prints very fast, It is both intuitive and easy to set up. Printing from both my PCs and Macs were painless and provided picture perfect prints every time. Replacing the ink is simple. The onboard control panel is easy to figure out quickly when you want to make a copy. It is wireless, which works well, but I mostly use it plugged into my network. Wireless, however, allows me to print from my iPhone, which is still a novel and cool thing to be able to do. And no, that aspect didn't require any setup on the printer at all, it did it right out of the box. (Once I joined the wireless network, which itself was simple)Obviously I have only had it for a few weeks, so I cannot really talk about the number of prints it boast per-ink. It says it will hold ink for two years worth of printing. That depends on how much printing you actually do I suppose.This is a larger printer, so keep that in mind if you want to put this in a smaller space. A ""regular"" AIO printer takes about 2/3rds the space this beast does!This printer is a welcome addition to our printing needs. Yes, it is more expensive than smaller printers, but Epson is trying (and will succeed based on this printer) to change the business of ink-jet printing. And change it for the better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W3OZXYBEV3RP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","R2W3OZXYBEV3RP","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't usually enjoy in-ear headphones. I like the over-the-ear variety, but thought I would give these Bose SoundTrue headphones a try.The audio quality is first-rate. I was happy with the frequency response in both high, mid, and bass. Actually, the bass blew me away for in-ear headphones, as that is usually the weak spot in them.The reason I don't usually like in-ear headphones, especially the ear-buds that come with either the Android or iPhones, is that they are uncomfortable to wear.

"I had been using Cascade dishwasher tabs, but we have not been happy with them as of late. They leave a lot of water stains, and don't seem to rinse well. So I was not thinking the Finish would work as well, as the Cascade cost more and I didn't have great luck a few years ago when I last used the Finish product. I have to say, though, that they must have changed up the formula, as we are VERY happy with this product. So much so, in fact, that I think this will now be our regular dishwasher tablet solution. No water marks, seems to really clean the dishes well, and each pellet is wrapped up separately, meaning they don't all stick together in the package like the cheaper brands do.

"As much as I like gaming on my iPad, there are still many types of games that I love to play but generally suck on the iPad. (for me!) I am a HUGE fan, for instance, of the GTA games. But a touch screen? Blah. But the iPad with this SteelSeries (Xbox-like) BT controller? WOW.Setting up the controller on my iPad could not be more simple. All I had to do was turn on the controller, go to BlueTooth on the iPad, select the controller, and that's it. Done. I then launched GTA San Andreas, and started playing. The game knew there was now a controller connected, it mapped the buttons to the same configuration as they would be on a PlayStation or Xbox, and I was up and running.Connecting and ease of use is one thing, but how does the controller feel and work? In a word: expected. When you first hold this controller, it should feel very familiar to you if you have ever used an XBox 360 controller. That's what my hand was telling my brain I was using. There are, of course, some differences, but for gamability, there are none. Zero. This felt great!The controller is super responsive. It works as expected, the batteries have a long life, and it makes gaming on my tablet a LOT more fun. I will also give it a go eventually with my computer, but it was the iPad I was most interested in using it with, and there, the SteelSeries Status XL rocked.

"As a decriminating phone user, it's hard to impress me. I say that not to cast a bad light in the 8 XL from BLU, but rather so you know where I am at while writing this review.

They all ran without a hitch.Set-up was very simple.It's Android, so you should have no problems there.Call quality was actually pretty decent!The badWell, the screen may be large, but it's about three years out of date. Compared to other Android phones of this size, it feels very dated.WiFi was spotty for me, even sitting a few feet from the WiFi router. Odd, that. Still, the LTE was great! Very fast (AT&T network for testing purposes)The build quality is just okay, not bad, but not really good, either. Feels like what it is: a cheap, large phone. The plastic cover is easy to remove, and it's nice that it does come with a protective case and screen protector.This is not gorilla glass, and for such a large screen, I worried about the long-term durability of it.Still and all, this is an unlocked large-screen Android phone for less than $150!

"Stand and fight, soldier! It's strange to hear this coming from a foot tall toy in 2015. I remember having GI Joe's back when I was a kid in the 70s, and this was the type of thing that was popular then. Captain America, of course, is reciting lines from the Avengers movies. And honestly, it's pretty cool. He has a few audio bytes, and they all sound pretty good for a toy. I'm not annoyed by them yet :-)My son loves this action figure. He wants some of the other Avengers and, of course, some bad guys to fight. The detail is really good on this figure, and I'm glad they used this costume rather than the one in the first Avengers movie, which kinda sucked.Good toy. $20 for this quality, detail, and neat features is a decent price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WAPXZ7T2F3R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5ZIRY#wasThisHelpful","R2WAPXZ7T2F3R4","A1VLVWTLV3LVHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VLVWTLV3LVHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really put these bags through the stress test on Sunday. Decided to cook a Turkey. (It was good!) We ate about half of it, leaving a LOT of Turkey. Usually this could then be cut up and destined to make sandwiches the rest of the week. It was not to be, as the Turkey, stuffing, and gravy took a spill from the top of the oven onto the floor. Sigh. So disappointed. (And yes, it was MY fault.) So, clean... clean... turkey goes into the garbage. The garbage where the Hefty bag is. Now, with all the mess, turkey, used paper towels, etc... there was a LOT of stuff. More, it weighed a lot. Well, hey, I have to review these anyway, what better way, right?The conclusion? The Hefty bag passed with flying colors. I also like that they are not wrapped around each other, meaning it is very simple to pull one, and only one, bag out of the box at a time. I HATE the ones that are static clung to each other, hard to find where to rip the bag apart from the rest of the roll, etc. NOT so with the Hefty bag!

"I am really surprised at the quality of this cable. For the price of this 4 pack of cables I expected the cables to break within a few days but they are very sturdy. Like many others have said my previous lighting cables bring at the end right before the plug and this is due to it being bent the wrong way. These cables have more rubber support that holds it in place and makes it harder to bend. The cables also charge my iPhone 6 equally as fast as the original cable without the premium price which I am really happy about.

"This charger is one of the best chargers I have ever used. I like that it includes a Quick Charge 2.0 port. Although I do not have a device that has Quick Charge built in my Note 3 charged much faster than through a standard port or outlet. I used my friends Note 4 to test the Quick Charge capabilities and I can say that it lives up to its name and charges the phone as fast as the Quick Charge allows it to.  I usually have at least devices connected at night and it has no problem charging it to full capacity in the morning. Surprisingly the charger does not get too hot when many devices are plugged into it.  I used it to charge my phone, Moto 360, and tablets and each port supplied the full amount of charge to my device which was pretty incredible.

"The windshield clamp is VERY strong, and you won't have a problem with it falling down. The phone holder opens up easily and each side has a groove of which your phone sits in. Each side of the clamp is rubberized and won't scratch or damage your phone. The mount swivels in two areas. First of which is the ball joint which turns your phone in any position. The second is the slider which tilts the phone high or low. Both joints are a little stiff. I put a little bit of house oil just to help them swivel just a little bit easier.This mount should accommodate most phones. The holder opens up to 4 inches and it fits my Nexus 5 easily. Something you should check on before ordering any car mount is your state laws. Some states allow dash and windshield mounts and others just allow dash mounts. I live in Michigan where both mounts are allowed but you should double check your state laws before using one or the other just to be on the safe side.All-in-all, easy to use phone mount.

"These are really fun addition to taking pictures with you android or IOS device, You get 3 lenses and each has different effect ranging from fish eye (my favorite) wide angle and macro for shooting really detailed shots. Fish eye is just what it states in terms of how picture looks and what i liked about the AUKEY lens are the fit, i tested all 3 lens on a Nexus 6 which has a round camera just as the AUKEY lens are round so fit was really good and in no case with all 3 lens did i see the lens in a picture unless i had the fit not perfect so i moved to a Note 3 which has a square lens on device and results were the same, no lens or shadow in the pictures. The macro and wide angle lens are screwed together so don't be alarmed when you open the box and there's only 2 lens so to use the macro lens which is 10x zoom for really detailed close up shots just a simple un-screw from other lens (wide angle) and you will be able to shoot great detailed shots but you MUST be very close to subject and have a pretty stable hand but once you get the hang of it its a blast. Wide angle lens is great for group shots or pictures with multiple subjects in it.The package comes with 2 clips that hold the lens and attach to your device and there plastic and in no case of using these lenses for 1 week of pictures and taking clips on and off multiple devices did i see any scratches or even a start of a scratch on any of my devices.Package Content: Aukey 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens (Fish-eye lens x 1, Macro/Wide-angle lens combo x 1, 2 x clips, 1 x lens cloth, 18 months Worry-free warranty lots of fun and recommend these to anybody who likes taking pictures.I got this device for a honest and unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KXLCZRUH5VTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CXK9FQ#wasThisHelpful","R1KXLCZRUH5VTG","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like the shockproof rubber that is all around the circumference of the device. The ""wheel"" design really keeps it from getting damaged.

"I got my hands on both the 5DS and the 5DS R so I will be switching between the two when talking about my experience with the cameras. Both the 5DS and the 5DS R is nearly identical to the 5D Mark 3. The only noticeable difference is the mode dial which is a bit more coarser. The main selling point of this camera is the new 50 megapixel CMOS sensor. Although Canon and Sony has had higher resolution cameras over the last few years, Canon has finally released the big guns with the 5DS (R). This is something completely different for Canon who usually keeps the resolution in the low 20s. The camera produces such high quality images that it slows down my computer when loading the images. To compare, I have never had that problem with my 5D Mark 3.I tested both the 5DS and 5DS R with three lenses: the Canon 300 f/2.8, the Zeiss 85mm f/1.4 and the Zeiss 21mm f/2.8. I chose these three lenses because it represented a wide variety of situations a photographer may be in.Canon 300 f/2.8 (telephoto)This is one of my favorite lenses that I use a lot in wildlife including when I go to the zoo. For the purpose of testing, I kept the settings the same on my 5D M 3, 5DS and 5DS R. When comparing the resolution between the Mark 3 and the 5DS(R), I noticed a lot more detail when zooming into the picture. The resolution increased about 30% from the 5D 3 to the 5DS and on top of that the 5DS R had a 10% increase over the 5DS. Those tests were at the center of the image (lens). As you go out the edges of the image youâ€™ll notice a decrease in quality which to me wasnt that big of a deal. Even with the decrease in quality there was a 20% increase from the 5D 3 to the 5Ds.Zeiss 85mm f/1.4 (standard usage)With the Zeiss 85mm Otus things are just a bit different. The improvement between the 5D III and the 5DS is about 20% in the center, slightly less off-axis. The 5DS R version adds about 5% more resolution compared to the 5DS. I was a bit surprised at the result and repeated it several times to confirm the numbers and it was so. The reason I was surprised is the Otus is the highest resolving lens, and my first thought was it therefore would benefit the most from the higher resolution cameras.Zeiss 21mm f/2.8 (wide angle)Again, we see the resolution is greatly improved, with the 5DS MTF50 numbers about 30% higher than the 5D Mk III, even in the corners. Throughout most of the image, the 5DS R MTF50 numbers are about 10% higher than the 5DS. However, in the absolute corners there is only a small difference between the 5DS and 5DS R cameras. From other things we know about this lens, I would assume this is because the corner resolution with this lens is limited by astigmatism.I want to clarify this just a bit because depending upon how a tester is presenting data, you may see them present this corner data differently. Imatest doesnâ€™t measure astigmatism exactly, but does measure slanted lines that are nearly vertical and nearly horizontal. When I present corner data I average 8 numbers: the horizontal and vertical reading in each corner. Someone else may present only the best corner number, or the median corner number, or just vertical or horizontal numbers. This might have a corner number better or worse than what we are presenting.SummaryFor photographers who demand nothing but the highest resolution, you will love the newer 5DS and 5DS R. Landscape, bridal and studio photography are just some applications which I can see where the new models will shine with their 50-megapixel sensor. Based on the already competent 5D Mk III body, what you have is an amazing megapixel machine designed to delight every pixel peeper out there. The new 5DS and 5DS R shine brilliantly in a slow and deliberate photography workflow for which lighting level is not a concern.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7ZS4IEXV5ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ERPT8#wasThisHelpful","R1A7ZS4IEXV5ID","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In years past, if someone asked me, ""Hey, I found this Tom Robbins book lying around, so should I read it?"" I would've said yes. No hesitation. No equivocation. ""That guy,"" I'd say, ""is a stylist. And I mean that in the best possible way.""Because that's what Tom Robbins is, was, forever shall be: He's the god young writers pray to when they're lost and trying to find their voice. He's the mountain every working writer surveys when they're trying to put a sentence together that's more complicated than subject-verb-predicate.There was a time when he was the writer â€” the man that every itinerant scribbler (myself included) wanted to be â€” and when he was an out-and-out rockstar among word wranglers; someone who signed the breasts of ardent fans (something he writes about in his new memoir, Tibetan Peach Pie), debuted on bestseller lists (something else he writes about) and had searchlights painting the skies at his book signings (which, you guessed it, he also writes about).But were someone to come up to me with a copy of Tibetan Peach Pie and say, ""Hey, someone just gave me a copy of Tom Robbins' new memoir. Should I read it?"" I'd have a slightly different answer. ""That guy,"" I'd say, ""is a stylist. And I mean that in the best possible way. But man, you gotta really like Tom Robbins to want to read that one.""And I'm not saying this because the book isn't beautiful. It is. Robbins has never met a pun, a blissfully crooked analogy, a magician's bit of verbal trickery that he didn't love (and lampshade, and then lampshade some more, with a grin and a wink as though to let everyone know that we're all in on the same joke).As such, his voice, stripped of its native Carolina drawl by force of will, ""sounds as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear."" In describing his reaction to seeing a Natalie Wood film at a tender age, he says his ""scruffy whippersnapper heart opened like a sardine tin ... radiating such a vortex of woo woo love it would have made Saint Francis of Assisi seem like a mink rancher.""Oh, and those ellipses in there? They're standing in for fifty or a hundred or two hundred additional words, descriptive and lovely and weighty and fierce, all describing his sudden, near-religious response to Tomorrow Is Forever. Why? Because Tom Robbins is, above all else, a stylist. He knows words the way a pool hustler knows chalk. And when he wants to make a point, he doesn't spare the printers any ink.But again, that's not why I'm adding the extra codicil to my usual blanket recommendation of all Robbins-alia. It's not because the man didn't live an interesting life (he was beloved of both Timothy Leary and the Hell's Angels, after all; drank beers with Shelly Duvall, dropped acid before it was cool, and was, briefly, suspected of being the Unabomber). And it's not because he can't tell a story (his evocations of the Depression-era South and the pre-Beatnik 1950's are the stuff of PBS documentaries, if PBS documentaries were regularly directed by the Coen brothers).But at a certain point little Tommy Rotten (his childhood nickname) grows up and becomes TOM ROBBINS, all caps. He becomes, right before our eyes, that young cosmic fool, burning up the landscape with his words and cleverness. He finds success and comfort â€” two things that are death to any memoir, unless they come only in the last couple of pages. And worse, he turns all that language on himself.See, that is the rough thing about reading this Robbins. Where, in every novel, he uses his black belt word-ninja skills to make us love the misfits and weirdos which populate his imaginary landscapes, here â€” by nature of the memoir as form â€” he is forced to speak about himself. And he does so the same way he spoke of Sissy Hankshaw, Wiggs Dannyboy, the Woodpecker and Plucky Purcell. This works well for tales of deformed hitchhikers and outlaw bombers, but it can become grating, navel-gaze-y and not-so-humble-brag-ish when it's Tom Robbins writing about Tom Robbins; when he has cast himself, by necessity, as the central hero in a book that reads nearly as weird and scattered and unlikely as some of his novels.So, going in, you gotta love Tom. You gotta be itching to know about his first acid trip, his feelings on tomato-and-mayonnaise sandwiches and his long list of ex-wives. You gotta imagine yourself washed up on a barstool in La Conner, Washington, trapped by a typhoon or a toad-rain or worse, and fortunate enough to find yourself sitting next to the now aged cosmic fool as he starts to talk and tell you the tales of how he got from Blowing Rock, North Carolina to here, consorted with artists and idiots, drank some beer, ran away with the circus, predicted the weather, loved some women, sired some children, traveled the world and, somehow, found the time to write a few books along the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LETXPG8QSGF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006226740X#wasThisHelpful","R1LETXPG8QSGF8","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cibola Burn is a big book. Huge, really, both in terms of pages (nearly 600 in the version I got), and in pure authorial chutzpah. It is part four in the Expanse series, which has, thus far, included three books and a smattering of novellas. And it represents, for dedicated readers of James S.A. Corey (in real life, the two-man team of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) the biggest, most sprawling leap of an already sprawling tale.Cibola Burn opens a few years after the events of the last volume, Abaddon's Gate. Our own solar system is now linked to a thousand other worlds by way of the Ring â€” a huge, alien gate that allows travel outside the Sol system and into a larger universe teeming with habitable planets. Where in the previous books in the series, we were constrained merely to our own little celestial neighborhood â€” a couple planets, a few moons, a bunch of asteroids, starships, wars and rumors of wars â€” now there is simply ... more.More of everything. It's a land rush, with settlers already fanning out into alien space and various government bodies struggling to both contain the flood of humanity and deal with the colonists already breathing the alien air on Ilus â€” closest and most hospitable of the new worlds.But this is all backdrop, really. The authors start large, on a canvas suddenly stretched to encompass a thousand planets, but quickly narrow down to focus attention primarily on Ilus â€” on the colonists already there and those in orbit who want them gone. And while this new, nearly limitless world is big, the authors corral it with attention to purely human-scale details.Corey has a (two-handed) facility with the language of the small and uses it to give an almost comforting provincialism to the tale: Describing a newly (and banally) redecorated office aboard a former battleship turned space station, they write, ""Sure, humans had invaded an extra-dimensional space with wormholes to points scattered across the galaxy, but they'd remembered to bring ferns.""And then there's Capt. Jim Holden â€” Corey's long-standing protagonist and one of a handful of POV characters who move the plot along. Though you'll have a solid chunk of pages in the rearview before he appears, Cibola Burn lights up from the minute Holden steps to the stage as captain of the light frigate Rocinante.Holden is just one of those magic characters who feels lived in â€” an immediately recognizable archetype (the ex-military man now making do for himself and his crew) who doesn't appear to know he's an archetype. He is Malcolm Reynolds, Han Solo, or certainly one of their close friends. And honestly, despite one big explosion, several deaths, a shuttle crash and all manner of nefarious activities occurring before Holden makes his first appearance, Cibola Burn only truly takes off once he comes slouching into the tale.To say anything more would be unconscionably spoilery, but I can say this: Fans of the Expanse series likely already know that it has recently been picked up for several additional books and as a TV series, and you only get that kind of attention as a sci-fi author if you've got a bit of Michael Bay in your DNA.It takes some time to get there, but the second half of the book is a good payoff for all the exposition and pawn-moving you'll have to tolerate in the first. There are chases. Rescues. Escapes. Stuff blows up. And then, even though Holden has ostensibly been sent to Ilus on a diplomatic mission, even more stuff blows up.But hey, I'm not complaining. What could've been 600 pages of multiparty talks between competing economic and governmental factions over the legal questions of squatter's rights and planetary eminent domain instead devolves with reasonable speed into betrayal, gunplay and bloodshed â€” which is precisely what this kind of story is built to do. It isn't space opera in any pure sense. Cibola Burn is a bit too slick for that. In the end, it's more like epic sci-fi â€” the science fictional equivalent of A Song of Ice and Fire (which is maybe more than a little appropriate, since co-author Ty Franck has also worked as George R.R. Martin's assistant), only with fewer beheadings and way more spaceships.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35MPC3CVILFII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031621762X#wasThisHelpful","R35MPC3CVILFII","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually when someone steps from our world into a fantasy world, they're one of two sorts of characters. There's the Bookish Outcast for whom the portal fantasy is a literal manifestation of the act of reading as escape â€” and there's the Chosen One, an otherwise unremarkable or unlikeable character who has a Destiny waiting in the other world. There are of course dozens of variations on these roles, but often portal fantasies are more or less wish fulfillment: we want to escape, to be wanted, to be important or powerful or our best selves.It's rare and refreshing, then, to encounter a book where the fantasy world and its denizens actively do not want the protagonist, and are invested in keeping them out.Sophie Opal Hansa is a modern-day adventurer: a 24-year-old marine videographer, dabbler in bio sciences, cave-diver, rock-climber and long-distance swimmer, to name a few of her several interests. Though raised by loving adoptive parents, and though she has a great relationship with her genius gay brother, she longs to know about her birth family â€” and learns, messily and gracelessly, the extent to which she was desperately unwanted.Still reeling from the discovery, she unexpectedly foils an attempt on the life of her biological aunt, and in so doing is swept away with her to Erinth, a watery world where everything from language to fauna seems just slant of the Earth she knows. Sophie is eager to document everything about it â€” but no one wants to speak to her, and her aunt, rather than being grateful for the rescue, demands that she leave, hinting that Sophie's very presence in Erinth will bring misfortune to her kin.At first I thought Sophie insufferable. There's a bull-in-china-shop quality to her character, and it took awhile for the narrative to acknowledge this instead of just taking for granted that her brashness is an uncontested virtue. I found looking at Erinth through Sophie's probing, cataloging and entirely entitled gaze frustrating and annoying. But the introduction of her brother Bram as foil, the raised stakes of the intrigues around her, and Sophie's own development as a character eventually led me to root for her and better enjoy the book's fantastic world-building.And it is fantastic: It's suggested that Erinth might be a near-drowned future version of Earth (our modern-day Earth is named Erstwhile by Erinthians), one made up entirely of island nations. There is no single land mass larger than Australia, and the subsequent politics are fascinating: There is a governing force known as the Fleet, an enormous number of ships made up partly of representatives from every island nation that sail, investigate and legislate together.Magic trumps technology (""mummery,"" an excellent touch), and is name-based; you can work magic on people by ""scribing"" them, provided you know their full names. But scribing is subject to legislation as well, and requires special skill and components that further complicate matters of trade.I also genuinely appreciated approaching a fantasy world through its natural history: its geology, geography and ecology. The attention paid to diving, sample-gathering and documentation was thorough and interesting; the writing that surrounds Sophie's voice often has the muscular precision that I associate with Elizabeth Bear's prose, and in parts I found myself reminded of some of Guy Gavriel Kay's work.For all that she annoyed me, I really liked the fact that Sophie was an athlete and scientist. It was interesting, too, to see the book's climax be a courtroom scene instead of a big magical showdown, complete with the kinds of introspections, compromises and uncertainties that enrich characters and their relationships.Ultimately this was a solid, enjoyable book, entirely appreciable on its own while setting up interesting hooks for future installments. As unconventional a portal fantasy as it is, and as much as I warmed to Sophie's character, I'd happily read novels entirely set in the well-built world of Erinth, untranslated by an Erstwhiler's gaze.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSLEH4JIY8CH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765334496#wasThisHelpful","RSLEH4JIY8CH1","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a fan of the Maisie Dobbs series â€” and if you're not, I highly recommend you give them a chance â€” you already know that Jacqueline Winspear has a formidable command of the history of the Great War, and a stunning ability to take some of the most amazing and horrible aspects of that era and bring them home.In other words, she is a master of taking grand ideas and winnowing them down to a very small, individual story that carries the punch of huge and visceral truth. Of course, there is always another meaning to that phrase, the one that refers traditionally to soldiers, the sons and lovers, no matter the war, no matter the battlefield: ""Bring them home.""It's clear that Winspear is fascinated by the ambiguities of war â€” and specifically World War I, so I was eager to pick up her new stand-alone novel commemorating the 100th anniversary of the war's beginning. And what Winspear does, brilliantly and poignantly, in The Care and Management of Lies, is to bring home the enormity of the war by making it personal through the intertwined experiences of four people.At the heart of the novel is parson's daughter Kezia, who falls in love with farmer Tom, the brother of her best friend, Thea. But the war breaks out just after Tom and Kezia marry â€” and he enlists, leaving her to run the farm. She, meanwhile, finds comfort in the home and hearth rituals that elevate her day-to-day existence. Even when she can't find the energy or resources to cook a full meal, she is determined to do her best to keep up Tom's morale by writing to him about her imaginary creations, and sending him the occasional treat.Tom lives for Kezia's long, detailed letters, filled with descriptions of the scrumptious dinners she creates for him. His captain, Hawkes, back home a wealthy neighbor of Tom's, monitors all the mail â€” and finds himself entranced by Kezia's letters. Meanwhile, Thea is feeling abandoned and estranged; she dabbles in the suffragist movement, then becomes a pacifist, and finally volunteers to drive an ambulance at the front.For everyone at the front, Kezia's letters are a taste of home. They provide comfort and inspiration â€” urging Tom and Thea and Hawkes to be the slightest bit more noble, more hopeful and more mindful of right and wrong. Yet, in the end, evils both small and large will accumulate, and no one will escape the war unscathed.Everything changed in 1914: The world order, the place of women, rigid class distinctions â€” and conflict wasn't confined to the trenches. On the home front, government and society struggled with suffragists, pacifists and conscientious objectors â€” those who challenged the status quo were met with breathtaking brutality.The scope of loss and savagery during the Great War is so huge, it's almost incomprehensible. And while there are plenty of history books and novels you can read that will give you glimpses of its grim reality, this book examines the home front and reflects a sense of hope. Kezia's choice to face a difficult life with optimism and cheer carries hope forward, touching everyone around her.Even us.Winspear knows the history of the war that changed the world. In The Care and Management of Lies, she's telling us the story, she's bringing it home. Beautifully, tragically, indelibly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYPLNNVX58ROO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062220500#wasThisHelpful","RYPLNNVX58ROO","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where the genre convention would be for the end of civilization to have been wrought by some disaster (terrorist attack, alien invasion, zombie infestation or a plague â€” take your pick), Lepucki tells instead of a gradual decline. Freak weather storms, a shortage of gas, a perpetually depressed economy, a health care system that cannot stem the spread of disease and a failing federal government all combine to wear down the Union until it is no longer functional and citizens have to create new forms of governance. The U.S. has ended not with a bang, but with a whimper, and those without resources find themselves condemned to the wilderness.Although neither the exact location nor the year is mentioned, we know we are in California in the not-too-distant future. Frida and her husband Cal â€” a couple in their late 20s â€” have escaped a dangerous and barely functional Los Angeles and have, for the past two years, eked a meager but content existence away from what remains of civilized society.It is Frida who names this their ""afterlife."" By dislocating the action from the present and familiar, this could have been a vehicle for the writer to focus on important themes, to tackle issues with language and ideas that feel fresh and new. Indeed, the matter-of-fact cataloging of their daily routine of foraging, gardening, hunting â€” of just surviving â€” and the nostalgic mention of all the things they still long for from ""before"" (meat, coffee, soap) gives some idea of all that has gone. We know that at some point gas and electricity became too expensive for ordinary people, that the Internet had become a privilege only for the very rich before it collapsed altogether. But as described, it is a tedious life, and the trivial domestic skirmishes that punctuate the couple's existence do little to endear them to the reader.In the early pages of the novel, Frida discovers that she is pregnant. She convinces her husband that they will have to make a difficult decision for the sake of their unborn child. Abandoning their solitary homestead, they set out to find a community that will accept them. It is this struggle to make a life in a drastically altered world that is at the heart of any good after-the-end story. Frida and Cal leave their little patch of Eden, and after two days' journey, find themselves on ""the Land"" â€” a settlement built around what once was a Wild West heritage village. For a time, it seems they may have found a home.The Land offers a community where all labor together and share resources. It is as secure as the times allow, and Cal and Frida work hard to ensure the support of their new neighbors when the formal community vote on their joining is scheduled. All the elements are here for an examination of society and self through the powerful, distorted prism that is genre fiction. What happens when the structures that held civilization together disappear or are worn down? How would we behave? Do we hold on to the past or create something new? At this point, California seems to promise answers to these questions.My trouble with this book was not its failure to live up to genre conventions â€” any good story can get away with breaking the rules. But I was disappointed that the characters remained thin, even through plot twists and revelations that should have granted them life beyond the page. The narrative leaps and too-timely disclosures (there is a resurrection of sorts and the revelation of several secrets including a conspiracy-laden master plan) meant that the story never felt entirely believable â€” so much does not hold together that it was impossible for me to feel truly invested in the story or convinced of the possible future the author imagined.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B75RGS675KMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316250813#wasThisHelpful","R2B75RGS675KMN","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm deeply conflicted about how to review this book. On the one hand, I literally laughed and cried from one page to the next and devoured the whole in a brief sitting.On the other hand, I've also read Rainbow Rowell's other books, and this one pales in comparison.So I could review it straightforwardly and say that it's funny, clever, charming, endearing, and all that would be true â€” but I could also review it and say that in some ways it's the least of the books of hers I've read so far, and that would also be true.Which I suppose is appropriate, given that this is largely a book about conflicting and equivalent truths.Georgie McCool is a successful L.A. comedy writer struggling to balance her work and family life. Her husband Neal, devoted to raising their daughters full-time, feels neglected in favor of Jeff'd Up, the hit sitcom that pays the bills but doesn't fulfill Georgie artistically; meanwhile, her writing partner, Seth, resents Neal for taking Georgie away from her work. In the week before Christmas, Georgie and Seth get the chance to write the show they've always dreamed of â€” provided they turn in scripts during the 10 days Georgie's planning to be on holiday with her family. The result is that Neal and the girls go to his family's home in Omaha without her.Georgie's stricken by this, more so when Neal seems to be avoiding her calls â€” until she calls his family's house from the yellow rotary phone in her childhood bedroom. It quickly becomes apparent, however, that the Neal she's reached through the yellow landline is speaking to her from 1998, early in their relationship, when he'd broken up with her the week before Christmas and driven from L.A. to Omaha without stopping. Pieced together through cross-temporal conversations, recollections and reflections, Georgie and Neal's relationship history takes shape â€” and Georgie must decide what to do with it in the present.All of Rowell's books thus far have paid some homage to geeky interests â€” superhero comics in Eleanor & Park, Harry Potter (ish) fanfic communities in Fangirl, Dungeons & Dragons in Attachments â€” but this is the first to feature an outright science fiction element in the time-blurring phone. It's a deliciously clever device: Using the increasingly obsolete landline as an anchor, foothold or portal into the past is a great idea, especially when the past in question isn't yet distant enough to be alien. As a metaphor for returning to a root-deep connection in the face of signal noise and distortion, it's excellent â€” but ultimately, it works better as meta commentary than effective storytelling tool.More Rainbow RowellRainbow Rowell lives in Nebraska with her husband and two sons.Author InterviewsRainbow Rowell Does Romance With A Subversive (Read: Realistic) TwistLandline coverFirst ReadsExclusive First Read: You CAN Phone Home Again In 'Landline'The cover of Eleanor and ParkMonkey SeeTrue Love, Book Fights, And Why Ugly Stories MatterI loved this book for exploring the intricacies of a difficult marriage that isn't abusive â€” a marriage that has friction and tension that stems from good people trying their best, rubbing their rough edges smooth against each other. I loved it for not questioning the fact that a woman can be a good mother and have a successful career, that a man can be a good father by working in the home, and that their problems stem not from gender roles but from personality conflicts. I loved the frequent sharp insights and succinct turns of phrase that pinned a feeling in place, and that are so characteristic of Rowell's writing.But I also found it uneven in its pacing and structure, and insufficient in its characterization. One of Rowell's strengths is in making every minor character come alive, step whole and entire onto the page, even if only for the length of a scene or two, with very few exceptions. In Landline, though, where the central conflict seems determined to be about Seth and Neal pulling Georgie in opposite directions, Seth is two-dimensional: He's either a cipher or an unmitigated jerk, and the best-friendship described in the book doesn't ring true.Without a solid relationship to offer any kind of serious challenge or check to Georgie's marriage, Landline feels lopsided. I thought, too, that it could have been better curated; the mix of Georgie's memories, time-crossing conversations and present-day commentary on the past made the book feel padded with repetition almost as often as it made it luminous and satisfying.But for the most part, I was deeply affected. I did laugh; I did cry; I did find myself thinking about the lives we dream and the lives we make, the lives we choose and the lives from which we turn away. I finished Landline wanting to talk about it, and trying very hard to remember the numbers I used to dial without a second thought, the seven-digit sequences that were as much a part of my consciousness as the names of the friends and family to which they were attached.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REN33Y54IA719/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049377#wasThisHelpful","REN33Y54IA719","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a line pop culture likes to flirt with. It's the line between naughty and nasty, between seamy and sordid, between icky and ""come on, really, I just ate lunch."" Back in the mid-'60s, when ladies always wore stockings and gentlemen still wore hats, S. Clay Wilson left that line in his rearview mirror.Amazingly, he still does. Fantagraphics' new collection of Wilson's early comics, The Mythology of S. Clay Wilson: Pirates in the Heartland, is so downright ... *blechhy* that it's impossible to even describe most of what's in it. That's not because it might trigger inappropriate frissons in your nethers, no â€” but it might make you barf on your desk.Wilson's characters, which include such playful-seeming figures as the Checkered Demon, Star-Eyed Stella and hordes of randy pirates, all seem to have memorized the Marquis de Sade. They engage in sex and violence with the same joyless compulsion, anatomical precision and tortured misogyny as the mad Marquis.And yet Wilson, no extraordinary draftsman, won countercultural stardom for these visions of the vile. He was a leader in the celebrated Zap Comix collective, which included Spain Rodriguez and comics king R. Crumb. His many fans included underground greats Ken Kesey and William S. Burroughs, and this is just the first of Fantagraphics' planned three-volume retrospective of his work.To understand why Wilson's comics felt so necessary at the time, consider what happened when Crumb published a strip about incest in Zap's fourth issue. ""Booksellers from Berkeley to New York were arrested for sale and possession of Zap #4,"" editor Patrick Rosenkranz notes. ""This news brought a mixture of triumph and apprehension to Zap's creators."" It also made it imperative for Wilson and his cohort to spit in the face of all censorship. That need went hand in hand with the urge (which became a requirement as the '60s marched on) to delve into the primal id as much as possible.And so Wilson's characters rape, kill and maim one another in endlessly creative ways. Gorgeous women are frequently tied up and victimized, while men's organs come in for a painful array of torments. But there's a certain innocence here: Some really appalling excesses are avoided, as is racism, and those tied-up women often seem to be enjoying their toils. Wilson also shares his era's sophomoric fascination with biker gangs.The funny thing is, though, Wilson isn't actually the wild man he seems to think. Both he and Rosenkranz believe his work depicts ""the naked human psyche."" But these comics don't have the spontaneity or idiosyncrasy of art that comes straight from the id. They're laboriously thought-out and composed, baroque in their detail. This isn't a primal scream; it's a cold-blooded assault on the moral instinct.""My idea is not to entertain them but to enlighten them,"" Wilson tells Rosenkranz. ""Or to make them sick. One or the other.""Wilson's true diabolism is evident in the basic experience of reading one of his comics. His panels are so dense, they can't be parsed at first glance. They're so stuffed with limbs and weapons and exposed genitalia, it's impossible to tell what's going on. You have to look carefully, painstakingly figuring out just who's doing what to whom, before your horror dawns. You have to work hard to be repulsed.Some readers weren't interested in working that hard, particularly women. When Wilson submitted a graphic strip to the Berkeley Barb, an underground paper run by women, he wound up arguing with the editors over whether or not a character was consenting to a sex act.It was a prescient question. Wilson's sexism dates him. He's arguably an equal-opportunity violator, firing off his cruelty in all directions, but he aims for women far too often. When women hurt men, it's usually because they're ""dykes,"" stereotypical butch lesbians with leather jackets and ducktailed hair. Gay sex, on the other hand, is usually ignored, except when effeminate men are the (occasional) targets.Ultimately, Wilson is a perfect representative of the dark side of the '60s. His work crackles with the viciousness that was the flip side of flower power. If he has any message to convey, it's that the world is falling apart: that (to quote Yeats by way of Joan Didion) ""the center cannot hold."" The background of one of his panels even shows a poor soul being broken on the wheel, an image straight out of Bruegel the Elder's apocalyptic painting The Triumph of Death.That must be why the overweening feeling accompanying Wilson's work is one of deep sadness. Wilson's devils, pirates and busty women perform compulsively, their rictus grins parodies of true pleasure. Living in the Haight in '68, witness to all its many experiments in higher human consciousness, he already seems to be asking: ""Is that all there is?""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHL1DZA51YQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606997475#wasThisHelpful","R1CHL1DZA51YQD","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Tucson, Ariz. National news about thousands of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border â€” some as young as 2 years old â€” is local news here. A front-page headline from this week's Arizona Daily Star reads, ""Immigration tension boils over in Oracle."" It's subtitled ""Protesters, supporters, clash; bus carrying children fails to show.""The article featured a photograph of protesters, adults standing by signs scrawled with red and blue markers. ""Remember the Trojan Horse"" and ""No se Puede"" â€” ""it cannot happen."" Protesters and supporters comment on whether the ""youths"" posed a threat to the community, as the sheriff claimed they did.""Where did the children go? What will happen to them?"" my 9-year-old asked over cereal and juice, which suddenly seems like a luxurious breakfast.Where did the children go, and what will happen to them â€” these primal questions remind me immediately of the body of work I love most. I often visit Maria Tatar's The Grimm Reader for a cold dose of courage. Her translations come from the Brothers Grimm, whose now-famous collection of Kinderâ€“ und Hausmarchen [Children's and Household Tales] was first published in 1812. The book was not intended for young readers. In fact, one early critic dismissed the Grimms' writing, Tatar notes in her introduction, as ""tasteless"" and ""dismal."" Yet the stories became wildly popular with parents to read to their children. (Ultimately the Grimm Brothers published seven painstakingly revised editions over some 40 years.)There is no book more timely, I think, than Tatar's exacting collection. The Grimms' tales are serious stories about children alone in horrible situations. You've probably heard the one about a brother and sister whose parents abandon them in the woods. A witch locks Hansel inside a shed, and plans to fatten him up and then eat him. But his sister, Gretel, shoves the witch in the oven instead. Tatar's version glitters with everyday details of wicked predation and quiet survival.Here readers will find familiar tales rendered in the Grimms' intended language, spare and poetic. In ""The Twelve Brothers,"" siblings take shelter in the forest to escape murderous threats from their father:""They went into the woods and shot rabbits, deer, birds, and doves, whatever was good to eat. Then they brought the food back home for Benjamin, who had to prepare it in an appetizing way for them. They lived together in the little house for a stretch of ten years, and time was never heavy on their hands.""Later in the story, their sister is trying save them. I love the intuition and dignity in Tatar's phrasing: ""She went and found a hollow tree, seated herself in it, and began spinning. She neither spoke nor smiled.""And this beginning from ""Little Brother and Little Sister,"" another tale of children alone in the world:""Little Brother took Little Sister by the hand and said, 'Since the day that our mother died, we haven't had a moment of peace. Our stepmother beats us every day, and when we try to talk to her, she just gives us a swift kick and drives us off. All we get to eat are crusts of hard bread. Even the dog under the table is better off than we are. At least he gets an occasional tidbit.' ""Then of course there's Snow White â€” a young girl who outsmarts a hateful queen by fleeing into the woods.These aren't escapist fantasies; they're stories of kids facing unimaginable terror.As Tatar writes, in fairy tales children must find radical ways to ""survive a world ruled by adults."" This is our grim reality. And it's the grim reality of these children at the border as well. Of course, not all endings are unhappy. Remember Hansel and Gretel? They manage to shove that witch in the oven, and they emerge from the forest ... alive.Kate Bernheimer's latest book is How a Mother Weaned Her Girl from Fairy Tales, which will be published in August.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRIHTLAODP6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393338568#wasThisHelpful","R3PRIHTLAODP6C","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jace Wilson is a 13-year-old boy who plans to do what many boneheaded 13-year-olds do: something dumb on a dare, to once and for all dispense with the idea that he might be a coward. But while psyching himself up to go through with the dare, he witnesses a murder â€” and before we know it, we're off. Michael Koryta's new novel, Those Who Wish Me Dead, sucks you in from the first page and doesn't let you go.It's clear that Jace must disappear until the murderers are found. So, how do you make a teenager disappear for a while? His parents come up with an ingenious solution: a bodyguard (rather than untrustworthy law enforcement) takes him to a wilderness survival program in the forests of Montana, designed for troubled teens.If you're looking for formulaic thrills and spills, then this is not your book. But if you want an elegantly written, taut thriller with an amazing sense of place, then look no further. As with his previous books, Koryta achieves that sense of place because he takes his research seriously. ""I made several backpacking trips into the same Montana and Wyoming mountains featured in the book and attended a wilderness survival school,"" he told me in an email conversation. ""I know I couldn't have written the same book without having a tangible sense of that world. The more immersion I have, the more potential it brings to the book.""A genre snob might call Those Who Wish Me Dead a ""literary thriller."" I think that's just a snobbish way of saying it's a well-written book â€” which it is, but it's also a cracking page-turner and a truly immersive experience. In addition to Jace, there is Ethan, a committed instructor who wills the boys in his charge to feel their environment and develop the instinct to survive it. And Hannah, a lonely firefighter, battling her own demons as she tries to help Jace outwit his pursuers.The dense and intimidating Montana forests provide a breathtaking backdrop for the action â€” and it's fire season, which ratchets up the tension. As desolate and remote as the wilderness seems, the terror of the chase is never far away, and the villains here are so evil they'll make you quake. The story will take you down paths you didn't see coming, you'll be shocked as truths are revealed â€” and of course you'll feel the heat of fast-approaching fires and the sense of doom in the face of nature's wrath.Koryta's writing has a cinematic feel, and in fact the movie rights for this book have already been acquired by 20th Century Fox. Several of his other novels are also in development for the screen.I actually met Koryta in person before I ever encountered his novels. We were at a book festival dinner a couple of years ago, and I was taken by the polite, unassuming manner of this gentleman, who graciously indulged the foodies at the table as we over-ordered to the nth degree at a hot Miami restaurant. I remember thinking, ""I don't know anything about his writing. I must look him up.""What I found was a thriller writer who can both write and thrill. To say that Koryta is prolific is an understatement. Did I mention that this is his 10th book in about as many years? And he doesn't tend to revisit the same well; most recently he's written The Ridge, a supernatural thriller about a big cat sanctuary, and a Friday Night Lights-meets-murder mystery in The Prophet.""My clock is finite,"" Koryta says, ""which means that the number of stories I can tell is finite."" He adds that he always knew he wanted to write, and so he got on with it: ""I wasn't willing to say, 'one of these days I want to write a novel.' I started writing novels.""

"DesignThe plastic body of the Acer Iconia One 7 feels flimsy. It has a fragile quality to its build, the same way a wooden pencil or crayon can break in your hand if you hold it the wrong way. The plus side is that it's lightweight, and sitting at 7 inches, it's very compact and portable.The top edge has a microphone pinhole, Micro-USB port, and headphone jack. The power button, volume rocker, and microSD card slot are on the right edge; speakers are at the bottom of the back.Acer offers the Iconia One 7 in a few different colors, depending on your region. My review unit was black, causing the wavy, weaved texture on the back to remind me of smooth, balding tires. It feels comfortable, in your hands, but I didn't like the slippery feel of the finish. Aesthetically, I found the semi-psychedelic weave pattern very pleasing. Thick bezels frame the screen like a gaudy plastic picture frame and help date the design of the tablet, along with its thick girth.FeaturesThe Acer Iconia One 7 ships with Android 4.2 and is upgradable to Android 4.4. There isn't much modification to the interface and I enjoyed the almost pure Android experience. The pre-loaded apps on the Iconia One 7 err more on the side of bloatware. Frequent travelers might appreciate the pre-loaded hotel booking app, and Google Play-averse individuals might find what they're looking for in the included app store alternative (an app that sells apps), but I found the bloatware to be extraneous. Also, you cannot uninstall them only disable them, which sounds like a cheesy line in a post-Internet sci-fi movie.PerformanceFor a budget tablet, the Iconia One 7 performs just fine. It can do all the basic tasks without a hitch, but doing anything other than simple activities is a test of patience.Large games take minutes to load and even longer to download. During game play, graphics were sometimes choppy and lag was frequent. Simple mobile games fared better, but graphics suffered from pixelation.The 1,280x800-pixel resolution screen is average for a budget tablet -- any lower and it wouldn't be worth a second glance. HD video looks fine, but I found images to lack a vibrant pop. The narrow range of colors is evident when watching rich, animated videos, but less so with live-action films and showsThe display has good viewing angles, however the screen is very glare-prone and makes visibility difficult in bright environments, even with the tablet's brightness cranked all the way up.ConclusionIf you're on a shoestring budget, it's hard to argue against the Acer Iconia One 7's bargain basement starting price. At $129, it's $100 less than the top 7-inch tablets like the Google Nexus 7 and Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7, and if you just want a slate for basic tasks like checking email, browsing the Web, and rewatching ""Breaking Bad,"" it's a steal. However, anyone who wants to do more on their slate should keep saving for an upgrade. It will be worth the wait and the extra cash.[...]","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DYXAC7LNZIEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCT3VK0#wasThisHelpful","R2DYXAC7LNZIEF","A2CQABVHIP3WWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQABVHIP3WWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a book which promises more than it delivers. Neo-naziism is a serious issue in the world and it is a movement which has the potential to return to the world stage.That said, the leaders of the movement in America and abroad as depicted in Blood Flag  are simply too much like flawed super-villains to outwit the police and intelligence services of the world.The idea of a search for an iconic Nazi symbol is a great one. There was indeed a blood flag which was stained with the blood of Nazis killed in Hitler's 1923 beer garden putsch. That flag is lost to history and hopefully will remain lost.

"Harry Bosch takes to retirement from the Open-Unsolved unit of the LAPD without a great deal of grace. He turns to Mickey Haller, his half brother, to bring  a wrongful termination suit against the department but otherwise finds himself in a new restless world where his identity-homicide detective-has been stripped from him.When Haller's investigator is badly injured in a hit and run incident, the Lincoln Lawyer turns to Bosch to help him with a high profile murder case. Bosch's constitutional reluctance to switch sides is ultimately overcome even though his former colleagues turn on him. What follows is riveting. Michael Connelly never lets up. The bodies pile up, unpredictably and when when the mystery is unraveled the suspense remains.This is Bosch's book with Haller as second banana, if that. Haller creates the scene while Bosch leaps to center stage. Bosch's post-cop career is not necessarily defined by The Crossing. For a better clue as to how Harry will spend the rest of his life, we will have to wait. Thanks to The Crossing, the anticipation is sweet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMPJROVZ7WL6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316225886#wasThisHelpful","RMPJROVZ7WL6B","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In July 2008, I wrote my first review of the original Livescribe Pulse. That review remains the top review for that model pen. I also have owned the Livescribe Echo which is the only true competition for the Livescribe 3.I use my Livescribe pens in my law practice. When I meet with prospective clients I take notes with my smart pen and retain a written and recorded account of the session. What distinguishes Livescribe smartpen from other brands is that when you touch a word on your notes what was being recorded at the moment the note was taken is played back. This is perfect for students, physicians, lawyers, and others who depend on note taking.The principal difference between the original two models is that the sense had speakers which would play the recordings (at the designated spot) while the Livescribe 3 plays the spot off a tablet or smartphone.The compensation is that the pen is thinner and lighter (the original Pulse looked like a cigar tube). Since I am never without my iPad, I do not need my smartpen to review my notes aurally.A few words about paper. You can print your own but the Livescribe notebooks are reasonably priced. the Moleskin edition has a very nice Moleskin journal. But if you are a power user, and I am, buy some notebooks. This smartpen model has a black Moleskin color scheme and is very attractive.It comes with 9 black cartridges for the pen. I prefer blue and like the notebooks the cartridges are fairly priced. So I bought some.I always add that before you record, know the law. In some states it is a crime to intercept surreptitiously oral communications, Florida is one such state. Public lectures, debates, school events are not restricted in Florida. In other states as long as one party is aware of the recording, it is legal.This remains a revolutionary product. My enthusiasm remains.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C5XHDI8C9Q9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A9Z1JK#wasThisHelpful","R2C5XHDI8C9Q9Z","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Design is apparently everything with Invicta. This is a well designed men's semi-dress watch with a metal band. It is very snazzy, but it is also a bit clunky. When you are talking quartz movement watches, accuracy is a given. This watch is accurate. However its very size suggests that the thinnest (and hence most expensive) movements were not used.This conclusion is supported by observation of the metal bracelet. I spent several days before I was able to master the mechanism which is surprising since I have worn bracketed watches primarily all my adult life. That said, it is possible to put on and take off the watch.Once you do, you will find that the bracelet itself has way too many links. I am a fairly big guy and I had to go to a jeweler to have three links removed. I am wondering why Invicta is targeting the morbidly obese with this watch.While at the jeweler I was warned to be careful around water. The jeweler advised that the seals were not tight and that water intrusion was a real possibility. I do not shower or swim wearing a watch and have no intention of testing it to see if it is indeed water resistant to 100 meters. If you are planning on diving with this watch however, be forewarned.So  to summarize (1) the watch is gorgeous, but large, (2) the bracelet is too large and cheap and finally (3) it may not be suitable for swimming and diving.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBR42LCFS8H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XNXG#wasThisHelpful","R3TBR42LCFS8H2","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hang around trial lawyers and you will hear war stories. You can trust me on this because I tell them all the time. Sebastian Rudd is a criminal lawyer who is not particularly afraid to cross the line into actual criminality. His life is defined by cases and by trials. When the cases and trials are over he moves on to new cases and new trials. Such is life at the bar for even the most ethical of practitioners.John Grisham has structured this novel like a collection of war stories. These are not mere war stories, they are simply great war stories. And the mystery the reader will confront is whether or not any of these events will ever be tied together by the end. I am not going to reveal that.What I will reveal is that Rudd is Vinny Gambini on steroids-figurative steroids at the very least, but perhaps the real stuff. Unlike Vinny he has real talent and can master even a hostile courtroom. Rudd is completely over the top-the kind of lawyer who will cheat and lie if called upon and somehow is able to deliver first class representation to his clients some of whom are first rate people but most of whom are societal dregs.This is a lawyer's book. It is one we will laugh about along with our favorite quotes from one Jerry Callo, Gambini's ""stage name"". However, you won't have to go to law school to treasure this book.

"Perhaps you, like me, have been wondering, ""What has George Foreman done for me lately?"" It is a good question concerning the boxer turned grill-meister who has apparently made more money hawking indoor grills than he made fighting Ali.But now George has come up with the ""Indoor/Outdoor"" grill which is basically the same product with a removable stand so you can either put it on the counter as you would with the original or take it outside and pretend you are grilling steaks on the barbecue.The removable grill, dishwasher safe by the way, is long like a griddle and the temperature control seems reasonably accurate. The cover is a rectangular dome, which is nice looking and has George's name inscribed on it. Assembly is easy.

"The international slave trade was outlawed in the United States on January 1, 1808. It had been outlawed in England six months earlier, but the U.S. Constitution forbade the implementation for twenty years of any law restricting the trade.This is the story of the Antelope, a mysterious vessel which transported over three hundred West Africans across the Atlantic in 1821 only to be seized by a Revenue cutter off the coast of north Florida and taken into Savannah where a five year journey through the legal process began. It is the true story of the great lawyers of Georgia and the United States who struggled to find the bright line dividing law and morality.The Antelope decision, authored by the great Chief Justice John Marshall, problematic. On one hand it set forth rules that led to freedom for some of the original captives and to the later decision of the Court in the Amistad case, popularized by Steven Spielberg. On the other, the slave trade continued for another forty years.The account of the case of the Antelope is likely to be incomprehensible to non-lawyers. The simple holding that slavery was antagonistic to natural law but not to the law of nations was the lynchpin of the Chief Justice's reasoning. Marshall did find a means within the facts of the case to free many of the captives, but as Bryant points out he could have gone further.I am a lawyer. I was a history major. I practice civil rights law. For me this is a perfect book. It may take a bit for others to get into the jurisprudence of what was referred to by my slave-owning great-great grandparents as ""our peculiar institution."" It was both peculiar and an institution which deserved to be eradicated from the face of the earth. The Antelope offered that opportunity and sadly turned away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRZAYCUYFGSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871406756#wasThisHelpful","RLRZAYCUYFGSU","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Everything has a history."" When I went back to a reunion at my boarding school, I sat in on an American history class being taught to a small group of eleventh graders. These words were uttered by the teacher who had engaged the students in a discussion of post-World War II America and the development of the shopping center. It was a profound insight and one which in spite of my undergraduate degree in history I had overlooked.Indeed everything does have a history and Stephen Witt has given us an enthralling account of the MP3 from its development in Germany to the culture wars which swept over boarders and engaged artists, music executives, governments, and electronics manufacturers in a life and death struggle against pirates and consumers. Stephen Witt recounts the mathematical insights of a team of computer scientists who stood on the shoulders of the giants of previous generations who had studied the auditory capabilities of the human ear.

Seizing his opportunity to get promoted to the murder squad Moran reports Holly's clue to the lead investigator, the unpopular and partnerless Detective Antoinette Conway.In a day long investigation told in Moran's voice, with first person backstories from a cadre of Holly's classmates and friends, the team slowly uncovers the answers which had long eluded the investigation. Like most superior mysteries the crime solving is just a road to explore much deeper issues. In this case it is the nature of friendship among teenage girls and their capacity to lie, cheat, steal, and kill.The Secret Place is complex, but aewarding exploration of the darker recesses of adolescence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZ416PNZYGWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026328#wasThisHelpful","R1OZ416PNZYGWR","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Few subjects, other than the Bible,  have as many words devoted to them as the American Civil War. This is not a book about one of the great personages of the war. Rather it is the misnamed account about Robert Bunch, the British consul in Charleston from 1853 until his departure without portfolio (the British did not recognize the Confederacy) ten years later. Thus most of his assignment was during the run-up to war. He was no secret agent either. He was an accredited diplomat of Her Majesty's Government.Notwithstanding the unnecessary aggrandizement, Bunch is an interesting character. Born of an English father and American mother, Bunch had significant familial and social connections. His assignment to New York as vice-consul led to a posting at Philadelphia and then to Charleston. It was there that he entered a world gone mad where firebrand politicians and the manored gentry shared a determination to maintain the institution of slavery.Bunch went out of his way to cultivate relationships with these powerful interests all while seeking the repeal of the Negro Seaman act under which free sailors in the British Navy were being arrested and held by the state. Eventually he succeeded.Bunch was however a great analyst who kept his government aware of events and their significance. Mary Boykin Chesnut's A Diary from Dixie, perhaps the greatest Civil War diary of all time, manages to drop the names of all the important people of her day in both Charleston and the Confederacy. Bunch's name is absent from the published editions I have consulted.As Civil War biographies go, it has the advantage of examining the role of the British Foreign Office in the hottest hot spot in the South. It is well written but ultimately as minor a work as Bunch was a diplomat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CEOWIYTF6P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307887278#wasThisHelpful","R27CEOWIYTF6P8","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the death of Henry VIII in 1547 to the accession of Elizabeth I eleven years later, England was in financial, social, political and religious turmoil.  Henry left one male heir, the nine year old Edward VI, who took his throne under the control of a Protector. As Edward matured his Protestant faith became even more strident and his oldest half-sister Mary, a devout Catholic, was forbidden to practice her faith and suffered greatly during his reign.Shortly before Edward's death in 1553 his protector Northumberland married off his son to Lady Jane Grey. Lady Jane, age 15,  reigned as Queen for nine days until she was overthrown in favor of Mary, the rightful heir. Jane, her husband and father-in-law all lost their heads for the attempted coup, although clearly Jane was a pawn.All of this intrigue and the presence of the Protestant Lady  Elizabeth as a focal point of anti-Catholic sentiment, created grave danger for the daughter of Henry and Ann Boleyn. Though imprisoned and suspected in every plot, she managed to keep her  head both figuratively and literally.This is a marvelous account of one of the most tumultuous periods in English history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LM9RW5MAL4O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345407865#wasThisHelpful","R3LM9RW5MAL4O5","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wilbur and Orville Wright are often characterized as bicycle mechanics who managed to launch the first piloted aircraft and fly it for a few hundred feet at Kitty Hawk. As McCullough documents, the Wright brothers were first class scientists and engineers who accomplished a feat which was believed to be impossible.David McCullough, who authored on of the great engineering works of all time The Brooklyn Bridge, carefully documents the life and works of the two brothers from Dayton. He credits those whose work inspired them and details how the brothers studied those materials, the flight of birds, and ended up inventing the wind tunnel to get accurate data. He explains the reluctance of the press and governments around the world to believe that manned flight had been achieved by these men. And then he shows how that all changed with the world becoming aware of these accomplishments.The Wrights financed their own endeavors without governmental or corporate support. When you consider that the Army had invested huge sums, greatly in excess of the Wright's total investment, this thriftiness is all the more remarkable.No matter what you will come away with a deep appreciation of the first men to fly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1708VPPL64AK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476728747#wasThisHelpful","R1708VPPL64AK4","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An unreliable narrator witnesses something. She takes the train every day, allegedly to work, but at a job which is no longer hers, past her old home where her ex lives with his new wife and their baby. She constructs romantic stories of the lives of her former neighbor and sometimes exits the train to wander drunkenly up and down the street.Something happens to her near her old home.. But even a physical assault can be a confused occurrence which lacks connection to reality. The perfect couple in a house exactly like hers has issues. She sees something. Then that perfect wife goes missing. She has seen something, but cannot recount it accurately. Her drinking is out of control again.This is a work of misogyny and murder. The women are driven apart and then together by their shared betrayal. It is a difficult read, and a book I put down several times only to be drawn back into its web.

"Comic book superheroes often have one superpower that enables them to solve problems better than anyone else. Amos Decker, former football star and Burlington detective, has a super memory. He was not born with it. It was acquired when he sustained a severe blow in his first and last NFL game.Years later his wife, daughter and brother-in-law are slain. Decker leaves the force, becomes homeless and only gradually rehabilitates himself. Private Detective Decker is on the job when two things happen. A seemingly deranged street person confesses to killing Decker's family, just as the local school is attacked by a shooter, who manages to disappear.So far so good, but this is not the David Baldacci who brought you King and Maxwell and the Camel Club featuring Oliver Stone.

"I deemed Adam Mitzner's debut novel A Conflict of Interest to be the best legal thriller of the 21st century and compared him favorably to the two masters of the genre John Grisham and Michael Connelly. I am hoping that anyone can write a stinker and that this ""thriller""is an aberration.Forty year old lawyers do not head up the most powerful law firms in New York. This is true even if they clerked on the Supreme Court of the United States and have an older mentor who put him in that position. Additionally they do not sleep with federal judges while having a case in front of them. Federal judges are very difficult to blackmail, much less murder. Emphatically since a federal judge never discloses why he or she recuses any blackmail attempt would be doomed to failure.Could some of this ever be realistic? Well, I suppose. During the Watergate Era United States District Judge Mathew Byrne was offered the directorship of the FBI while he was presiding over the Daniel Ellsberg case, a political interference so shocking that Judge Byrne revealed it from the bench as he acquitted Ellsberg because of governmental misconduct. Having a President promise a seat on the Supreme Court to a judge in exchange for a guaranteed conviction of a Russian oligarch would inevitably come out and so would the impeachment bills in the Congress.Adam, this just isn't thrilling.

"The very first words I learned to read in the early 1950s were ""See Rock City"". It was hard not to miss those words which were plastered atop every barn visible from the roadside all across the South. Jerkins' book, published in 1996, lovingly documents the 200 or so then-remaining barns.Almost twenty years later, far fewer barns remain. The last one I saw, and photographed in 1987, on Georgia 42 near the entrance to High Falls State Park is in the book looking even more derelict than it had nine years earlier. I went looking for it in 2012 and found it gone.These bars advertised a natural rock formation atop Lookout Mountain in Walker County Georgia just outside Chattanooga Tennessee. The genius of these signs, placed on northern as well as southern highways, was that they actually drew crowds to ""See 7 States"", which is a claim which would have made PT Barnum blush.(I think at most you can see four-Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and just maybe the top of some Smokey Mountain in North Carolina. To think you can see Virginia and Kentucky is absurd and seeing South Carolina is highly problematic).But it is the barns and the hucksterism that makes this lost bit of the mid-century South genius so memorable.I am glad somebody thought to document the advertising barns of the America's two lane highways before the Interstate Highway System and Lady Bird John's highway beautification efforts consigned them to the scrap heap of rural history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX72ZEQGF5MPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0965230805#wasThisHelpful","RX72ZEQGF5MPE","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well educated Americans know this about the War of 1812:1. The British burned the White House.2. The Star Spangled Banner was composed after Francis Scott Key witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore.3. Andrew Jackson chased the British at the Battle of New Orleans  and ""..they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles, And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em, Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.""The last bit of knowledge is courtesy of Johnny Horton.The next bit of knowledge, and a lot of it is courtesy of Ronald Utt, who has prepared an eminently readable account of the social, geopolitical and military aspects of a war, most assume we won, and some assume we tied. As Utt points out, the United States Navy, facing the most powerful naval power of any age heretofore, did so fearlessly and with great distinction. Naval officers like Issac Hull, Oliver Hazard Perry William Bainbridge, Steven Decatur,Thomas McDonough, and James Lawrence have their names attached to towns, highways, and streets across the United States. Few today know just what they accomplished for the continued freedom of our nation.This is an extremely well written and historically balanced book. There are very poignant moments such as the scene of the funeral of a valiant captured American captain whose body was brought to Halifax for burial. His coffin was draped with the Stars and Stripes and his pallbearers were six British Navy captains whose obvious regard for the fallen foe was evident.Even former history majors like me will learn from this volume.

"How does this HP Color Laser All in One compare with the Brother Printer MFC-L8850CDW Wireless Color Laser Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax  another wireless color laser printer with the same features?  I recently reviewed the Brother printer, finding it to be the best of three color laser printers I have owned.It still is, but this HP printer essentially costs half as much. Like the Brother, it delivers crisp and clear documents from printing or scanning. Since I do  not fax and have never from an All-In-One device I express no opinion on either units qualities.The main deficit is speed. The HP machine spits out documents in color of black and white at 30 ppm. By contrast the HP LAserJet Pro provides color and B&W at 14 ppm, roughly half as fast.There are minor distinctions as well. While the setup and touch screen interface are easy (at least on a Mac), the Brother machine has a separate tray which can be used for printing up to ten  envelopes. The paper tray is larger on the Brother unit, and on the HP you must empty it to print envelopes.Duplex printing (both sides) is allegedly available on the HP, but I spent half an hour trying and gave up. The Brother software has a large toggle switch for duplexing.Now given the overall quality and great price, do these slight differences mean you should go with the Brother Printer MFC-L8850CDW?

One minute she is a Eastern European worker; the next a pushy Noo Yawkah inconvenienced by being stood up for a non-existent appointment with the man she plans to kill. Her gender bending switches belie a deep and vicious feminism in which violence against women is avenged in a bizarrely selfless homicidal rage. Munroe, it seems, has little need of personal conscience because she maintains a highly developed social conscience.

"One of the few deficiencies associated with solid state drive equipped Macs is the comparatively small size of internal storage. In an era where 500 GB is the norm and even 1 TB is common, a 256 GB drive is small.When I bought my 15 inch Mac Book Pro with Retina Display, I rationalized that with iCloud and other cloud storage options the loss of half of my hard drive would be find compensation in the increased speed and reliability of a SSD. To some extent those assumptions were correct. Nonetheless I often found myself managing drive utilization trying to keep at least 10% of the total storage space open.Transcend provides a solution. For slightly less than $80 and a Jet Drive Lite 350 I have increased my drive space by fifty percent. The Transcend Jet Drive Lite is essentially a High Capacity SD card which installs into one of the existing SD ports on MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. â€¨â€¨There are four different model cards, and you should carefully consider the chart before ordering. Each card is tailored for specific machines and is designed to be inserted into the port and lie more of less flush against the case, not sticking out like a normal SD card. The normal card can be spring ejected. This is not so with the Jet Drive Lite. It is very difficult to remove, and since it is in effect a secondary SSD that permanency is a virtue. I have inadvertently ""ejected"" the card fin the Finder only to discover it simply disconnects. The simplest recovery mode is to log out and then log back in and the drive is automatically recognized.The card comes in a box, with warranty information, and nothing else. The limited lifetime warranty, if you can read it without an electron microscope, is quite good. You should make sure however that your card data on it is being backed up regularly. I use Time Capsule and the setting on  installation excluded the Jet Drive Lite. I think the reason for this is that the drive  appears to your Mac to be no more than a temporary SD card and SD cards are not backed up unless you change your settings.So having a card and an open port I pressed it in. Since the card doesn't eject, there is no ""click"" associated with my effort. However an icon appeared immediately on my desktop, and I knew my MBP was reading the drive.My first thought was that I would move all my photos and videos to the Transcend Jet Drive Lite 350. Immediately I received a message- ""The destination disk is not properly formatted.""Indeed it was not, and that is peculiar. We are looking at a product designed exclusively for newer Apple laptops, and the card was FAT formatted. It takes less than a minute to reformat the card to Mac OS Extended (Journaled)Once the disk was reformatted I moved my entire Aperture Library to the Jet Drive Lite . I am a lawyer, not a technician, but it seemed to me that the transfer speed was quite fast, at least as fast as my USB 3.0 flash drive and possibly as fast as a Thunderbolt device.All in all, the Transcend Jet Drive Lite meets a lot of my needs. The price and the huge capacity should justify you giving it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XQNHY6TW47XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K73NT1C#wasThisHelpful","R2XQNHY6TW47XR","A32O5FZH994CNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32O5FZH994CNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lone McGantry has done a lot of things over the years and some of the jobs were difficult and nasty. The latest job has the potential to be seriously annoying. He really does not want to be a taking a bunch of wealthy English folks on an excursion from North Platte, Nebraska out to the Sandhills. But, he got roped into this mess by Buffalo Bill Cody himself. Telling Buffalo Bill no is a near impossibility and as a result McGantry said yes when contacted by the foreign nobility. Even if he is increasingly of the mind that this is a super bad idea, McGantry isnâ€™t one to go back on his word. There also a nice payday in store once all is said and done. As Buffalo Bill pointed out in his telegram, the English folks have money and are willing to spend it so at least some of it should come his way.For Lone McGantry there are not a lot of ways to make money in the Nebraska panhandle of the 1880s. An English Lord by the name of Reginald Haddenforth, his wife, Lady Claire, and several others in the party intend to sightsee and hunt Buffalo. Lord Haddenforth and his wife have hunted boar in Germanyâ€™s Black Forest as well as gone on safari to Africa three times. Lord Haddenforth writes books about his adventures and intends to do the same regarding the Sandhill extension. All that is well and good, but Lone McGantry is of the opinion that women should stay in town where they belong and those going out on the expedition need to understand that the old west is dangerous and needs to be taken seriously.For Lone McGantry and his men, life in the old west is not some grand adventure to be had before returning to a plush chair to sip cognac by a roaring fire. For men of McGantryâ€™s ilk, the old west is their way of life and absolute reason for being. It is in their soul. It comes with, at times, a brutal cost. Â¬It isnâ€™t to be trivialized in some book. A hard and painful lesson Lord Haddenforth and his party have repeated opportunities to learn over the next few days.Originally published several years ago by Oak Tree Press, an e-book version was recently published by Bil-Em-Ri-Media. First of a series, Dismal River is another example of why author  Wayne D. Dundee is nominated for  many awards and wins quite a few.

"Christine was twelve years old when her mom, Eve Moran, shot her current boyfriend, Jerry Santini, dead in their apartment. It wasnâ€™t long afterwards before Christine once again took care of her mom by claiming to have killed Jerry Santini. After all, cleaning up after her mom was a job Christine had really gotten really good at by then thanks to the fact she had lots of practice over the years.Told in flashbacks of various lengths through the book, Concrete Angel by Patti Abbott details eighteen years of Christineâ€™s life. From 1964 to approximately1982 in various locations in the Philadelphia area Christine dealt with a life of quiet family chaos. While the book opens with the shooting that in some ways did change things in other ways it was a minor blip on a long and wide ranging continuum of the family dysfunction.Such issues are frequent topics of the authorâ€™s shorter fiction. While multiple crimes are present in the book, the psychological relationships are the heart of Concrete Angel. Hence the labeling of the book as â€œdomestic suspenseâ€ in this age of making everything fit a nice neat designation. Makes sense if you also believe that Faulkner is domestic suspense as there is definitely a tone of Faulkner throughout the read. Granted the book is set in the Northeast but the characters could have easily come out of the Deep South. Right down to the neat freak bigoted Grandmother who is all about appearances over everything and anyone else.The relationship between Christine and her mother takes precedence for a variety of reasons, but there are other familial relationships at work here that donâ€™t always have Christineâ€™s best interests at heart. The aforementioned Grandmother an obvious case in point, but there are others just as guilty. This is not one of those families you wish to be born into if your goal is a safe and nurturing environment. A mighty good book that defies easy labeling, Concrete Angel is a complex read that pulls you in deep and will haunt you long after the read is finished.Kevin R.

"In this fifth and final Truman Smith mystery, Galveston Private Investigator Truman Smith still has no interest in looking for anyone. Dino wants him to quit trying to figure why alligators and birds get killed and get back to finding people. Because of the backstory that series readers are familiar with, Truman is not remotely interested. Dino has pushed this same idea before, but this time he swears things will be different and wants Truman to trust him.Truman knows better than that having heard the â€œtrust meâ€ line before. Instead of looking for folks, these days Truman works as a freelance contractor of sorts running a credit check or background on folks. It is the middle nineties and he can easily accomplish both from home when he is not reading a book. But, Randall Kirbo had come to Galveston back in March for spring break and vanished.  Nine months later the son of Jack Kirbo, who used to play football at the same time Truman and Dino did back in day, is still missing and Galveston PD has gotten nowhere. Jack and Dino were friends on the football team and still are as well and have had some business dealings that have worked out well for both parties. Because of all that and more, Dino wants Truman to see if he can find the kid.December on the island means it is time for the annual â€œDickens on the Strandâ€ and the accompanying throngs of tourists and traffic. Certainly not two of Trumanâ€™s favorite things and neither are Mr. and Mr. Kirbo. Definitely not the boorish Jack Kirbo. His wife is devastated and just needs some sort of answer as to what happened to her son. It is because of her that Truman agrees to investigate the situation. That investigation will lead him to the underground party scene, a murder, and a lot more in Murder Takes A Break: A Truman Smith Mystery.Fifth in the series that began with Dead on the Island, the character of Truman Smith is pretty well fleshed out as is his occasional sidekick, Dino. Readers know what makes Truman tick and what demons continue to haunt him. That leaves the book to be about the mystery and several are at work here in this complicated tale. As expected regarding anything from Texas legend and author, Bill Crider the book works on all levels. The twists and turns are many, the humor is occasional, the action is frequent, and the read is mighty good from start to finish.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Public Library System.Kevin R.

"Five short mystery stories make up the Three-Minute Mysteries Bonus Pack by Stephen D. Rodgers. Each short mystery is designed to give the reader enough clues to solve the case. Once you think you have the mystery figured out, you turn the page, and see if the solution is the one you came up with to solve the case.Store owner Alice Mendoza needs to forget about her insurance claim to focus on the questions of Police Detective Carol Simmons. In â€œThink Globally, Steal Locallyâ€ an armed robbery of a store that specializes in hand-crafted items from all over the world has few suspects.Stacy is the new widow in â€œA Dying Clue.â€ Detective Laura McKinley has to figure out what role, if any the restaurant partly owned by Stacyâ€™s husband, Matt, played in the death.The Boss is dead in â€œCream of The Crop.â€ Detectives Wilson and Handler have to go figure out who killed Mr. Baldwin at work.As in the first tale, robbery is also the subject of the â€œAll-Knowing Eyeâ€ where Detective Pamela Yates tries to catch the thief that hit the Nyman House. A character name change part of the way through the story is not a clue though the error does mar the read a little bit.It is a far different world than Officer Dana Cooke is used to as she does perimeter duty in â€œModels of Bad Behavior.â€ Blending into the background and being ignored by several suspects who just canâ€™t be quiet could be a very good thing for her career wise.The tales in the Three-Minute Minute Mysteries Bonus Pack are all good ones. Author Stephen D. Rodgers makes sure that there are multiple possible suspects in each tale who are capable of various crimes. An entertaining and fast read, the book moves quickly and offers quite a few surprises.Amazon reports that I picked this up in the middle of August to read and review.

"By way of â€œKindle Worldsâ€ comes Slip the first novella of the G.I. Joe Interstellar Cadet Corp Series by Jack Bates. Mission commander Josie Llewellyn has a major problem. Her trip with the seven young cadets has gone horribly wrong. It was supposed to be a simple in and out mission onboard an experimental spaceship to test the capabilities of machine and give the cadets a little flight experience. That was before they encountered the worm hole and were flung far off course. Where they are and how to get back are just two of the obvious issues from the start.The fact there is a COBRA mole onboard is just going to make things much more difficult for all involved. A damaged ship, a stressed and very inexperienced crew, and more are at work in G.I.  Joe Interstellar Cadet Corps: Slip by Jack Bates.A few typos marred this otherwise very enjoyable read that shifts in point of view between the various members of the crew aboard ship and people at the COBRA base. As it is a 66 page novella, character development is somewhat limited as the focus is on setting up the future books of the series while proving plenty of action. That is done very well by the author who has created a read that is quite enjoyable. The book serves as a good solid foundation of what clearly is going to be an interesting series.Material was purchased to read and review using funds from my Amazon Associate account because of the authorâ€™s recent mentioning of the book on Facebook.Kevin R.

"When you solve the murder of an alligator as well a few other things you get a reputation for getting things done. Truman Smith might prefer to sit at the house on Galveston Island, but Dino comes to drag him into yet another fine mess. Though, at first, it doesnâ€™t appear to be that big a deal.

Because of their past history dating back to High School and a broken nose he contacted Dino to spread the word.  Not only has he made a decent amount of money for Dino, Lance did all right for himself as he made plenty of money on the stock market while working for a brokerage firm there. He had a gift, made a ton of bucks, and came back to build and live in a fancy house with a view of the bay. If a major storm comes churning through the Gulf the house will be toast, but in the meantime the views of the sunsets are spectacular.So too is the sight of Anne who is sitting a couch in Lanceâ€™s house when Dino and Truman arrive. Anne was a special love in High School long ago. The sight of her rattles Truman to the core as he still has incredible feelings for her. She is married now and older, but she still has Truman in ways he canâ€™t fully explain. According to Anne, her father-in-law asked for Truman specifically and Truman still would like to make Anne happy if he can.Out in the Eagle Lake area north of Houston near a little town called Picketville, Red Hineman (Anneâ€™s father in law) manages quite few acres for Lance Garrison. Thanks to government program the land is a natural habit for water fowl and other birds. One of those is the Atwater Prairie Chicken also known as a grouse. With only 108 or so in the world, including forty or 50 in captivity, the bird is a very endangered. Now, somebody has killed one by shooting it. The dead bird was placed in such a way to make a clear statement. The government sent somebody to investigate, but all he did was massively annoy Red.  Lance is involved in the bird project and wants Truman to go poke around and see if he can figure out what happened before the Feds impose penalties and take other actions.Lance is a jerk always has been and always will be, but he is willing to pay $500 a day plus expenses. Not only is it a chance to make Lance pay for his help, it is also a way for Truman to spend at least a little time with Anne. So Truman agrees and before long is dealing with a cast of suspects including a possibly crooked sheriff, the local militia, a radio host sure the government is about to attack any minute, small town politics, and more in The Prairie Chicken Kill: A Truman Smith Mystery by Bill Crider.Fourth in the series that began with Dead on the Island this read finds Truman Smith once again in a strange case as he moves around Southeast Texas. As this was first published in the mid 90s, it does not follow the current fad of dropping a body during the first three pages or feature an incredible hook in the opening sentence. Instead of the current gimmicks all the rage, it features a read that opens with introducing the characters and their relationship, the premise or initial mystery, and then builds slowly and steadily from there as events make things more and more complicated.  A little darker in tone than most of the Sheriff Dan Rhodes series, Truman drinks his Big Reds and gradually puts the clues together in a case where nearly everyone is a suspect. Plenty of twists and turns fill the read making The Prairie Chicken Kill: A Truman Smith Mystery by Bill Crider another very good read.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Public Library System.Kevin R.

Filled with interesting tales of complicated characters dealing with events in their lives, Flash And Bang: A Short Mystery Fiction Society Anthology brings a pleasant read by way of a variety of stories. As in other anthologies, each reader will have his or her own personal favorites among the 170 pages, but all the tales presented are good ones in their own way.While I am a writer as well as a member of the Short Mystery Fiction Society I did not submit a story for this anthology.

"It is October 1960 and Douglas King has worked himself to a position of some power at Granger Shoes. He has plans to move up and take over the shoe company as do others who intended to use him as a small part of their plans. Competing agendas and the future for Douglas King is at stake as his money is tied up in a deal to finally achieve his long held goal. A goal that he is not going to let anyone or anyone interfere with as he finally sees a real opportunity to fulfill his dream.That future is not going to be thwarted by the kidnapping of a child. If it was his child, it might make a difference. It isnâ€™t.  It is the child of Kingâ€™s chauffeur so Douglas King does not see the need to pay five hundred thousand dollars to get that kid back. If he gives his money up to meet the ransom demand, he will lose his opportunity and will very quickly be forced out of a job. One does not launch a takeover bid and survive the failure.The men of the 87th Precinct donâ€™t see things the same way as Mr. King. Detectives Meyer Meyer and Steve Carella certainly donâ€™t and never will. Of course, they never have had that kind of money working for the NYPD and never will. They are honest and hardworking cops who do their best day in and day out despite all the job stresses and everything else. A kidnapping case gives them a break from petty crimes, bad coffee, and dirty jokes. It is cold this October in New York and the next few hours will tell the tale.Kingâ€™s Ransom: An 87th Precinct Mystery by Ed McBain is a good classic cops and robbers style read. Along with the complex details of the business deal and the kidnapping case, readers are treated to the backstory of numerous characters and their own situations as day to day life is a business deal as well. Sometimes, by fate or chance, you make the wrong bargain with the wrong people.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Public Library System.Kevin R.

"â€œYou know what I think, Chief Stone?â€â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€â€œMost of the time he loses, but sometimes the devil wins.â€ (Page 243)It isnâ€™t a point Police Chief Jesse Stone can argue. First with the LAPD and now with the Paradise PD, Stone has seen things that prove to him that evil does exist in the world whether or not one wants to specifically ascribe such things to the devil. It is especially true currently with the discovery of the recent bodies in Robert B. Parkerâ€™s The Devil Wins.The Norâ€™easter that struck Paradise, Massachusetts was a hard storm. It did damage around the area including causing the partial collapse of an old abandoned factory building on Trench Alley. This is an area of town that does not fit the picture post card idea of a scenic New England town and wonâ€™t any time soon. It is an area of decay featuring old and long abandoned warehouse buildings that in their day provided jobs and now serve to be last resort refuge for the homeless, drug users, and others.In checking out the collapse, Office Molly Crane found a body. A body that near as she could tell in the few minutes she was surveying the scene had not been there long. She didnâ€™t get to look at the scene much before the Fire Department folks arrived and she was ordered out of the building. Good thing to as minutes after Jesse Stone arrives on site and is briefed by Crane, more of the building collapses.When, days later, Molly and Jesse are finally allowed back into the building they discover that the body is not alone. Two other bodies, dead for years, are also present. Two skeletons that, based on what little are left, appear to be childhood friends of Molly Crane. Two young teen friends who vanished without a trace years ago.With Suit still recovering from recent events and limited to desk duty and Molly nowhere near the top of her game due to her close proximity to the case, it is up to Jesse Stone to figure out what happened and how everything is connected. He also has to stop a killer or killers bent on tying up their last few loose ends.Author Reed Farrel Colemanâ€™s latest effort in the Jesse Stone series is another good one. This read finds Jesse finally at home in Paradise (after all it has been ten years) and at peace with his drinking. In several other areas he is not remotely at peace and the guilt over those situations drives him as he works to solve the murders in a town that doesnâ€™t want to deal with its own shameful past. Robert B. Parkerâ€™s The Devil Wins is another good one as Red Farrell Coleman makes it all work from start to twisted and surprising finish.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Public Library System who do not care if my review is objective or not and just want their books and movies back on time and undamaged.Kevin R.

"A tale by Garnet Elliott is always a good one full of pulpy goodness as Garnet Elliot never disappoints. Such is the case with Dragon By The Bay, his latest novelette set in San Francisco in 1866. The Civil War is over, the Gold Rush is very much on, and people are active above and below ground with many of them pawns in various nefarious schemes. This is not a genteel San Francisco, but a city of criminal chaos where anything goes and often does.Carson Lowe is newly arrived in San Francisco having come over on the ferry from Oakland with very little money in his pockets. He has plans and dreams, but they suffered a nearly fatal setback recently when he was in Nevada where he nearly lost all of his money and his life. The current plan is stay low and be careful. That was the plan before he saw the men of very hard appearance roaming the streets, members of some sort of vigilance committee, clearly looking for somebody to take their frustrations out on as soon as possible. Carson determines it is a good idea to get off the streets as quickly as possible and goes into a nearby tavern.Once inside he spots a poker game underway. That game just might be the place to run his time tested scam regarding a mine of sliver just waiting to be excavated. The problem with time tested scam is that others may be aware of the scam and not take kindly to your attempt to scam them. They may inflict heavy violence upon you before making sure you wind up in the local jail.That is exactly what happens to Carson Lowe in short order. Once in the local jail he is witness to the rescue of a fellow prisoner by the name of Nine Serpens Hsien. A legendary figure in San Francisco and a man that is said to be immortal with inconceivable powers.What follows is a kung fu adventure style story that is a fast moving tale of deceit, alliances, and martial arts in a time tested tale of the battle between evil and those who oppose evil. Frequently the flying fists are as fast as lightning, as are the feet and a few other things as the action moves around and below the city of San Francisco. Paying homage to the movie Big Trouble in Little China, author Garnett Elliott has penned a complex novelette that is a sheer blast to read. No matter how you label it if you call it a western, a kung fu adventure, or something else, Dragon By The Bay is packed top to bottom in pulpy goodness and delivers an excellent read.Paperback was supplied by the publisher in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"We all remember that female singer that made us crazy as adolescent boys. The one that you fantasized about meeting up close in the most intimate and very personal way. Okay, donâ€™t admit it, but I did. I am also not about to say who that was, but I still have all her records. Not CDs like the kids today have, but the old vinyl records. For Nob Brown that certain singer was,  and to a certain extent still is, Lana Strain. Her murder twenty years ago remains an unsolved case.LAPD Lieutenant Gloria Lopes has decided to give the murder book to Nob in an effort to cheer him up. Nob used to be a cop before he walked away from the job. These days Nob is having a hard time on a variety of fronts including working as a freelance writer. The Lieutenant, who also happens to be his frequent bedroom and anywhere else sexual partner, says that she is giving him the book for six days so that he can do research and just maybe sell a piece on the murder as part of a twenty year retrospective on the stunning beautiful singer. Considering Nob is known as a true crime writer, as well as any other kind of writing that pays the mounting bills, this temporary gift of the murder book for a legendary cold case that is still a hot bed of publicity just might save him form the financial ruin of his recent divorce.Lana Strain died when Nob was 17. It rocked his world at the time and the incident still shakes him to the core when he sees the brutality of the crime scene photos. While giving him the murder book for the stated reason of Nobâ€™s being able to sell some writing is one goal, Nob is highly motivated to solve the crime the LAPD has not been able to for all these years.Twenty years after Lanaâ€™s violent death in her home, Nobâ€™s poking around will bring him contact with her family, Russian organized crime, porno peddlers, and more in Go Down Hard by Craig Faustus Buck. It also might get him and everyone he cares about killed as someone works to tie off loose ends uncovered by his poking into the cold case.While some reviews have referred to this as a mystery noir spoof that would imply far more humor and slapstick than there is in the book. Nothing in this hard hitting and often violent book is remotely slapstick. At times graphic in terms of language and descriptions, this is a crime noir style story with an underpinning of sarcasm throughout the read. Nob Brown tends towards the sarcastic in word and action, but when things get dangerous he is prepared to be one hundred percent serious to get the job done.According to the recent interview with the author on The Rap Skeet Blog this is the start of a new series. That is excellent news and this book was incredibly good. Go Down Hard by Craig Faustus Buck, recently published by Brash Books, is very much worth it and one you should not miss. It is one of those books that if the award committees and voters in various organizations have any sense next spring it will be up for quite a few awards.Material supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"Doak Miller has done a few things over the years. At one time he was a cop with the NYPD. Then, as is often the case, he left the force under some possibly question ale circumstances. Taking with him what he had earned and learned over the many years of service he moved elsewhere and started anew while missing a bit the old job. While he could get by on his NYPD pension there was no harm in obtaining a private investigator license. There was also no harm in making contacts with the local law enforcement.That small effort led to a rare job by the way of Sheriff William Radburn of Gallatin County awhile back. It worked out well as he seemed to fit the role of an undercover hit man pretty well.  So, the good sheriff would like him to do it again. This time the target is one Lisa Yarrow Otterbein, wife of George Otterbein. She has made it known in certain circles that she would like to be rid of her wealthy husband as soon as possible. In short, she wants to hire a hit man and the person she spoke to used the information to make a deal with the sheriff on another matter.The plan concocted by the sheriff and Doak is for Doak to wear a wire and pose as a hitman from South Jersey in to take Lisa Yarrow up on her contract. At least that is the sheriffâ€™s plan. Doak Miller has a far different idea based on a fantasy he has always had. If Lisa Yarrow looks anything close to the picture the good sheriff has showed him she fits the bill perfectly from a visual standpoint. The question is whether or not she can fit the bill in other ways.And, of course, if he can get away with it.This latest read from author Lawrence Block by the way of Hard Case Crime is a very good one. Filled with interesting characters, classic noir movie references, and an edge to it in the Florida heat, Doak Miller develops a plan and works it at a steady and ultimately nerve racking pace. Everything he does is done for a reason and that includes indulging other desires here and there along the way. Violence is a large desire in him and takes many different forms including sex.Sex in various ways with various people either directly or by way of talking about it is a large part of The Girl with the Deep Blue Eyes. As such the book is a very adult novel and very explicit. It should be avoided if you are not looking for a hard edged noir that works on every level or you prefer your books to include recipes, crafts, or cats.Simply put, The Girl with the Deep Blue Eyes is a classic noir story with all the trappings from start to surprising finish. One would not expect anything else from the author or the publisher. A mighty good read that does not disappoint and is highly recommended.I received an ARC by way of the authorâ€™s publicist in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"It is March 1956 and private investigator Jack Laramie is in Dallas as Between Juarez And El Paso begins. It has been a long drive for Jack in his Desoto towing his horse trailer home as he came in to Dallas by way of Amarillo. All he wanted was a good drink when he wandered into â€œRubeâ€™sâ€ on Commerce and Field streets.It was not long before a fight broke out as they often do in drives such as â€œRubeâ€™sâ€. In the aftermath of the brawl he runs into a â€œShel Eastmanâ€ who he first met on a forced march as prisoner of war back in January of 45. They both survived the prison camp known as Stalag Luft Three and more and came home with more than a few inner demons to deal with. While Jack has found the open road to be some solace, what has kept Shel going through still more grief in recent years is the love of his daughter, Karen.These days Karen is far from her Dallas home as she is studying literature out at Texas Western University in El Paso. At least, she is supposed to be there. Shel has no idea where his daughter really is as both her and her college roommate seems to have vanished. Staff of the university claims that Karen was never studying there. Police in El Paso as well as local private investigator there were of zero help.A while back there was a picture in the local paper in Dallas that showed two Cuban casino owners, a U.S. Senator, and three ladies. The ladies were young, beautiful women and one of them was Karen. Despite the picture in the paper, Shel has not been able to get anyone in El Paso interested in the situation or the plight of his daughter. Shel was politely warned off and the grief stricken father desperately needs Jackâ€™s help.Jack goes to El Paso and soon realizes something very strange is going on at the border city. It isnâ€™t just the fact that the staff at Texas Western is being so uncaring and difficult. It isnâ€™t just the fact that with a little help from a female contact he learns young female students are disappearing at an alarming rate. It isnâ€™t just the fact that distinctive men in suits seem to be everywhere eyeballing certain folks all while the local cops take a hands off approach. It is all that and more and wants Jack Laramie sticks his nose in things his presence draws unwelcome attention in multiple ways.This sixth book in The Drifter Detective series is another solidly good read. Written by Alec Cizak there is a darker tone in this installment than some of the earlier read in the series which began with The Drifter Detective by Garnett Elliott. Plenty of action and intrigue are at work in novel that quickly escalates the hard boiled tension as Jack Laramie confronts one and all in his latest search for the truth. While it would help to have read earlier books this enjoyable series, one could begin with Between Juarez And El Paso if one were so inclined. It is a mighty good read.Paperback version supplied by the publisher in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"Bounty Hunter Bodie Kendrick normally works alone. But, these are special circumstances in the borderlands of the Arizona territory. Doc Turpin has a considerable reputation as a bounty hunter over in Texas. Bodie Kendrick primarily works in the territories of Arizona and New Mexico. Each has heard of the other over the years so it makes sense to unite in a partnership after their paths cross as a result of the massacre at New Gleanus.Bodie Kendrick had the misfortune of riding into New Gleanus about an hour after the Harrup brothers along with their cousin Huck Mather and in the company of their new outlaw buddies, the Klegg gang, robbed the local bank. While the robbery of the bank had been accomplished easily and could have led to a clean getaway, they instead went crazy and shot up the town and its citizens. Six were killed, numerous others including women and children were wounded by the shots and/or flying glass as bullets flew everywhere. The destruction of store fronts and property was heavy as were the injuries and deaths. All of it was totally unnecessary and proof that the combined gang had to be stopped at all costs.Doc Turpin had arrived in town just after Bodie did and also went to work helping out by tending to the wounded, putting out fires, and anything else he could do in the immediate aftermath.  Doc had been chasing Otis Klegg and his gang after their recently botched robbery of a payroll wagon that resulted in the deaths of three guards and the driver. Considering the shape of the town and its citizens, the local posse is not going to get the job done. They may be good at tending a store or running a farm, but these folks are not going to be able to deal with chasing and capturing these hardened and increasingly violent criminals.After discussing their assessment of the situation, Doc and Bodie agree to form a partnership to go after the violent killers and put an end to their trail of carnage once and for all. That partnership will create an additional mission that will take them across the border into Mexico in Rio Matanza (Bodie Kendrick- Bounty Hunter Book 2).Following the excellent Hard Trail to Socorro author Wayne D. Dundee has created another complicated western filled with mystery, action, and realistic characters. Plenty is at work here in a tale that spans countries and cultures sure to please those readers that prefer traditional westerns. While one can read Rio Matanza first, it is well worth it to start at the beginning with Hard Trail to Socorro. Both are mighty good westerns from an award winning author.Material was either picked up awhile back via funds in my Amazon Associate account or when the author made the read free.

"Author Harry Hunsicker spins tales of Dallas that donâ€™t fit the glitzy image advocated by the Chamber of Commerce. His Dallas is one of dope dens, backstabbing in the barrios as well as city hall, a river and a roadway system that was deliberately constructed to divide the rich and poor, where the ends justify the means in you are on the winning side of the deal. Where the streets are paved with broken dreams amidst the cracked asphalt and where babies are born with no hope and no chance to get out. This view was part of the backbone of his very good Lee Henry Oswald Mystery Series (begin with Still River) and is also present in the Jon Cantrell Thriller Series. The second book in the series, Shadow Boys, picks up a few months after, The Contractors and leads readers on a history lesson while dealing with a violence fueled here and now though not all of the violence comes by way a weapon.When he isnâ€™t messing with the tourists at the Grassy Knoll by tossing around empty rifle cartridges, Jon Cantrell works for a law firm out of Washington, D. C. He is paid well to discreetly handle situations that arise when government shipments of important cargo are not returned or fall into the wrong hands. While the law firm prefers that he not moonlight, in this case, his boss has granted Jon Cantrell permission to meet with someone that they would like to have a relationship with going forward.That someone is Deputy Chief Raul Delgado of the Dallas Police Department who is a rising star in the DPD despite, or maybe inspite, of his violent background. The movers and shakers have begun grooming Delgado and offering advice as they believe that he is a person who someday might be sitting in the governorâ€™s mansion down in Austin or occupying a legislative seat in Washington. The same drive that got Delgado to where is now is the same drive that in some ways is preventing him from rising further. While aware of that dichotomy, Delgado is more focused on a mission of a personal nature. Delgado wants a certain 13 year old autistic boy who lives with his elderly grandmother in West Dallas found. The child has been possibly missing for a few days now and the details of his living situation are very sketchy. Delgado canâ€™t use the vast resources of the DPD and needs a man with the proper skills as well as being sufficiently motivated to get the job done. Considering the boyâ€™s name is Tremont Washington Jon Cantrell is most definitely the man on both counts. Not only does he have the skill set, Jon Cantrell owes a debt to Tremontâ€™s father that he can never repay. Cantrell is also seriously annoyed that despite what he had been told by the Texas Department of Public Safety ten years ago the family was never relocated to California and has remained in a very bad situation in West Dallas.Tremont Washington has to be found. That storyline is the primary storyline for the book which features several other storylines all interconnected in various ways to the primary hunt for the child. Throw in a missing government weapons shipment, an out of control SWAT officer, city politics, and a series of vigilante murders, among other items, and things get very interesting in the Texas heat.Shadow Boys is a fast moving and intense read that surpasses the first book, The Contractors. Interspaced with the action and the mystery are small flashes of cynical and often sarcastic humor. Violence comes in many forms in this thriller as does political expediency and deceit. As in the first book of the series, there is some hard edged sarcasm about the city along the Trinity River that has no real reason for being other than sheer force of will. While the Chamber of Commerce may hate Hunsickerâ€™s non photo shopped version of Big D, the author showcases yet again that he has a very good understanding of makes the city and its residents tick in various ways. Along the way he delivers a complex thriller that crisscrosses time and space all across the city proving that Shadow Boys is one book to make sure and read.Book Three in the series is titled THE GRID and was released August, 2015. The book is in my tbr pile and will be read and reviewed soon.Material was supplied by the author quite some time ago in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"Published by All Due Respect Books one knows that The Deepening Shade: New and Collected Stories by Jake Hinkson is not going to be one of those light and happy books. All Due Respect is known for their anthologies and other projects where the happy people and cozy cats would be killed and their bodies buried upside down in that old rock quarry outside of town. There are no happy people in The Deepening Shade: New and Collected Stories where the tone of the tales is dark and where religion and/or alcohol often play a role. Sometimes their role is minor and other times their role is major. Often times neither is the answer as events grind along with a certain inevitability due to fate and the choices these characters make. Finding the line between fate and personal choice is rarely easy and such is the case here.The read opens with â€œMakerâ€™s and Coke.â€ Stopping by Knightâ€™s Liquor Store on the way to work was a possible mistake. Certainly drinking on duty was a definite mistake.Dancing as Dixie Delight at The Fur Trap doesnâ€™t change the fact that she is â€œThe Big Sister.â€  Janie has a huge problem and needs her help.The girl is not only pregnant, but has been roughed up a bit in â€œThe Girl from Yesterday.â€ The guy who walked into the homeless shelter with her did not look like the kind of guy who would do that, but the bad guys who do that sort of thing are not always obvious. Marie Porter, one of the people who runs the place, wants to know a lot more.Not only is Randy considered Mister Employee of the Monthâ€ at Alltel he is also more than willing once prompted to talk about â€œRandyâ€™s Personal Lord and Savior.â€ The backstory of why he does not drink and is so religious is the point of the tale.Just after noon on one August afternoon three robbers come into the restaurant looking for money and more. Marianneâ€™s attention on her potential client is destroyed. In the â€œAftermathâ€ of the robbery her perspective and maybe even her world is changed.She never had children and now, in a strange twist of fate, she lives in a nursing home across the street from a daycare. What might have been is the ache of memory as well as physical pain in â€œThe Empty Sky.â€Graham has a major problem and needs Larryâ€™s help in â€œCold City.â€ Since both are cops the problem is worse than for a normal citizen. Then too, because they are cops, they have certain options.There are problems that the McDonalds Corporation doesnâ€™t pay enough for one to deal with minutes before going off duty. A customer is publicly making a big deal about one such problem in â€œMicroeconomicsâ€ so now it has to be dealt with before things get worse.A Police Sniper is hard at work in the very short â€œGood Cover.â€Handling snakes as a test of religious faith is just part of the deal at work in â€œThe Serpent Box.â€ It is not news to crime readers that serpents come in many forms.Heâ€™d known that night after she screamed in her sleep that being with her had been a mistake. In â€œNight Terrorsâ€ the waking hours afterwards are worse and the stuff of nightmares.When your wife is cousins with somebody you have to do things with folks would prefer not to do. Such is the case here in â€œDinner with Friends.â€ If only they all knew what you were capable of and had done you might not have to sit around and listen to these idiots.It was just supposed to be funny. The ad was supposed to be a way to blow off some steam. Then things got really serious in â€œCasual Encounter.â€Attending the meetings of recovering alcoholics was a means to an end in â€œThe Theologians.â€ He might not be the only one using the group meetings for a far different purpose.Summer heat in Arkansas is just part of the background in â€œOur Violence.â€ So too is the legacy of family as well as unresolved childhood issues that could be based on genetic as much as nurturing.A read containing stories of characters dealing with the blows of life, The Deepening Shade: New and Collected Storiesâ€ is a work that resonates on many levels. A hard scrabble way of life is the background to many of these tales as folks deal with events of various types. Dark humor is at work here as is religion, desperation, and crime. Whether choice is really at work in each of these tales, as some would argue, is a question that often is not easily answered. These stories feature people dealing with events where fate and choice are the opposite sides of the same coin and it is up to the reader to determine which way the coin landed.The Deepening Shade: New and Collected Stories by Jake Hinkson showcases a complexity and a variety not seen in many short story collections or even anthologies for that matter. Much is at work in each of these tales in a book that is not for everyone. A mighty good read and one well worth your time both as a reader and as a writer.Material supplied by the publisher last fall for my use in an objective review.Kevin R.

"Clearview, Texas, in Blacklin County has a little bit of everything. Feral hogs, a Wal-Mart, and, of course, the occasional murder or death by misadventure. It may even be the home of a haunted house if you listen to some folks. Not that Sheriff Dan Rhodes puts much stock in ghost stories, haunted houses, or anything paranormal.He does put stock in reports of gunfire. Called out late one night to the supposedly haunted house over a report of flashing lights and gun shots, the Sheriff is relived to find no sign of Seepy Benton and his new enterprise known as Clearview Paranormal Investigations. With Officer Rudy Grady as his backup and a summer storm rolling in Sheriff Rhodes would like to believe somebody took the weather for a sign of something nefarious. Unfortunately, that is not what happened as they find the body of Neil Foshee.The drug business exists everywhere and it certainly does in East Texas. Meth dealer Neil Foshee was well known in these parts for his criminal exploits as are his surviving cousins Earl and Louie. Nearly as bad as their departed cousin, Neil, Earl and Louie are not very bright and are not fine upstanding citizens. That makes them immediate suspects though Sheriff Rhodes, who has given up drinking Dr. Pepper, knows there are others.  A possible suspect is Neilâ€™s former girlfriend, Vicki, who these days seems to have turned her life around and may have the romantic eye of her boss over at the local auto parts store. There are others in a case that has no easy answers and very few clues. Solving the crime isnâ€™t easy and with Seepy Barton constantly going on about ghosts and claiming to be helping out things donâ€™t get any easier. A runaway bull and a couple of other problems donâ€™t help matters, but that is life in Blacklin County.The latest in a long series is another solidly good read that includes Ivy, Hank, Lawton, Jennifer Loam and a host of other regulars. It takes Rhodes some time to assemble the mystery pieces in Between the Living and the Dead: A Dan Rhodes Mystery and that mystery journey sprinkled lightly with humor is once again what makes this series so much fun. Released August 11, 2015 from Minotaur Books, the read is another good one in a long line of good ones.ARC was provided by the author in exchange for an objective review.Kevin R.

"It has been three long years since that late fall night that Ryan vanished from Tularosa. Many in the western town thought he was dead. Considering the physical shape he is in now as he rides into town it is amazing he didnâ€™t die that night when Kane and his men ambushed him outside of town. Considering the shape he is in mentally something in him did die that night.One of those ambushers was a Kane brother known to one and all as Bill Kane who is about to hang for the murder of Ryanâ€™s sister, Sally. Whether he did it or not is not the issue for many in the town who feel the tyranny of the Kane family. It didnâ€™t take the jury long to convict him of the murder. After all, Bill Kane was found standing over the body by Pat Congrady who runs the hardware store. The same Pat Congrady that everyone around knew loved Sally and knew would never hurt her. The fact that a Kane was involved and thus could be punished for the sins of the family meant more too many than whether or not he actually did it.Pat Congrady had been planning on marrying Sally Ryan right up until she died. It had been three long years because everything changed when Ryan vanished. Kane got the Ryan land leaving Sally nothing but a small shack to live in. After Ryan vanished and everyone thought he was dead, Sally was never the same and wonâ€™t be ever again.Why Ryan is back isnâ€™t clear to anyone---even Ryan himself. The events that happened that night in Shatterâ€™s Grove changed the lives of all who were there and several that we are not. Ryan is back and will be forced to confront his past and the legacy he left behind.A solidly good western with a couple of surprises along the way, Ryan Rides Back: A Wild West Story is a read far different from the authorâ€™s various mystery series. A western novel of personal redemption and forgiveness, much of the read is spent in the past as Ryan tries to adjust to life in the present. Delving deep into the psyche of the main character means that some of the various distant secondary characters are little more than one dimensional type figures with little depth to them. Interspersed with Ryanâ€™s journey of redemption, are sections devoted to other important characters and their perspective. Their various situations are often complicated and were changed significantly; either directly by the events in Shatterâ€™s Grove and his subsequent disappearance or indirectly by way of ripple effects. Ryan Rides Back: A Wild West Story is a solidly good western tale that works well from start to finish.Material was recently purchased to read and review using funds in my Amazon Associate account.Kevin R.

"ThugLit! Issue 18 (July/August 2015) delivers again what readers expect out of this series. Characters on the edge money wise or in other ways doing questionable things in order to survive. They may not hate baseball and apple pie and may even crack a joke or two, but they are also folks that probably would steal from you as you lay bleeding out in the street. Not necessarily bad folks, but since you are dying and donâ€™t need your stuff and they do, all is up for grabs.After a very brief introduction, ThugLit! Issue 18 gets going with â€œWaylon, On Rerunâ€ by Michael Pool. Bad enough Waylon is a thief. Currently, he is stealing a bunch of stuff from some guyâ€™s house. The fact that he plans to opportunistically take advantage of a mentally challenged guy to help him steal the large television is worse.The world has gone to hell and the fact that Joseph Skelter canâ€™t smoke the real thing in his own office is proof. Smoking an e-cig and blowing the vapor at a client is just not that intimidating. His latest client is Arthur Brennan and he needs some intimidation in the worst way.  Lawyer Joseph Skelter is already annoyed with him before he starts explaining what his problem is in â€œProof of Deathâ€ by Mike Madden.There are dead people inside the house at 222 Foxglove Avenue. At least two are down when one looks through the mail slot in the door. Booster is going to have to go inside and assess the situation as most likely something went wrong as the people inside were cooking drugs. He will be the only person going in the house in â€œCanaryâ€ by Mathew J. Hockey because the place is probably about to blow.â€œThe Fairâ€ by Dan J. Fiore is a bit different in its format. The story unfolds via a transcript of a detectiveâ€™s interview with a Gale Hough. There was some sort of event at the Fair and Gale Hough was, at very least, a witness.The wrestler Krusher Kompanski is supposed to go into the WWE hall of Fame in September. Unfortunately, he isnâ€™t alive to receive the award. Our narrator explains why in â€œThe Konpanski Incidentâ€ by Joseph Rubas.Liz is once again waiting on her boyfriend, Rich. Sitting in the car is an industrialized area of Gary with an envelope of cash is making her rather paranoid. Rich and Liz have a plan to get out in â€œThe Calumetâ€ by Amanda Marbais.Matt wants to drive his wife to work in â€œXâ€ by Angel Luis Colon. Normally, she would drive her own car, but she has a bunch of papers to grade and needs to get them done now. The kids of today are far different than previous generations and one in particular has created a growing problem.The park is crowded in Anaheim, California as tourists make the Micky Mouse empire a little richer ever second. Threats come from inside the park as well as outside as the Mickey Mouse empire has a long reach for the entertainment dollar. Sometimes a problem has to be quietly fixed and that is where Manero comes in by way of â€œShadows of the Mouseâ€ by Garret Elliot.The eight tales here in ThugLit!: Issue 18 are all good ones. People do their jobs. Sometimes they live to fight another day. Sometimes they donâ€™t. It is called life and it ainâ€™t easy. As it clearly states on the cover these are Stories of Crime. It isnâ€™t feel good happy times in these neighborhoods and one does what is necessary to make a buck the hard way. Along that path there are some flashes of dark humor and some folks even get out alive making this read not quite as dark as earlier ones in the series.Material was purchased via funds in my Amazon Associate account in order to read and review.Kevin R.

Brian Fanning never made it home and his wife Michele called 9-1-1 in a panic earlier today.What little they have gotten from the Patrolman Danneman does not sound good. Considering what he found, Patrolman Danning may have made a very wise choice in handing the case over to the detectives. One always starts with the spouse and that is what Detectives Coughlin and Holzer will do in Blind Eye: A Short Story Prequel.Also included in this e-book is chapter one of Another Manâ€™s Treasure, Book 1 in the Palmyrton Estate Sale Mystery Series featuring Detective Sean Coughlin.This approximately twenty pages short story is an interesting mystery tale with a couple of twists and turns.

"If you are a teen and run afoul of the law in Blackburn, Massachusetts, you are going to experience some bad times out on a rock out in the harbor. According to Sheila Gates, who comes to Spenser on the recommendation of Rita Fiore, her son Dillion Yates was put out there by a local judge. Making a fake twitter account for his vice principal and making some smart aleck tweets got him charged with terrorism, stalking, and making threats against an administrator.What was clearly a joke to anyone with a sense of humor has resulted in a harsh sentence of nine months in the juvenile facility per Judge Scali. Legendary in Blackburn, thirty miles north of Boston, Judge Scali is a law and order type judge with zero tolerance for any misbehavior by those under the age of 18.  Shelia Yates canâ€™t see her son out on Fortune Island where he and many other kids are locked up for all sorts of crimes--- real and imagined--- and she can only talk to him by phone for a few minutes every couple of weeks. While Rita Fiore is handling the appeal case, Sheila would like Spenserâ€™s help to figure out what is going on out there.He agrees and before long he is on the way to Blackburn, Massachusetts. Spenser does not like his bullies, never has and the smart thing would have been to not try and bully him. Instead, some of the locals tried just that and in typical Spenser fashion got push back.Ace Atkins once again continues the characters made so famous by the legendary Robert B. Parker. Along with an interesting mystery featuring Spenser with some assistance from Hawk and Susan, observations about the situation regarding for profit prisons and their real cost in terms of financial and society are made. In a case that could easily come from the headlines Spenser works to get to the bottom of some nasty business in Robert B. Parkerâ€™s Kickback: A Spenser Novel by Ace Atkins. While not epic, it is certainly solidly good and well worth your time.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano, Texas Public Library System.Kevin R.

"Border Patrol Agent Hunter Kincaid has never seen anything like the tracks she is seeing in the Big Bend area of Texas as this short story opens. The tracks are fist sized and donâ€™t show any signs of toes, claws, or anything human or animal.

Whatever it was came across the river and relentlessly marched through and just kept going.Hunter followed the tracks which came through the river at what it known as â€œMoraâ€™s Crossingâ€ and isnâ€™t about to stop. The tracks made their way from there to the Simmons Ranch where they seem to have gone right through the barbwire fence without missing a step.

"I Am A Roving Gambler: Two Stories Of The West by Bill Crider features two previously published in the late 90s western short stories. Each tale also features a hero that is, in fact, a roving gambler who will also solve a mystery. A hero that found the intoxicating allure of gambling despite the presence of a preacher father who did a fiery sermon in a booming voice as he rode the circuit in the old west.In â€œWherever I Meet With A Deck Of Cardsâ€ our hero has been invited by Red Collins, owner of the Bad Dog Saloon, to play for the house. He is an honest gambler and prefers to stay on the move, but he could use some steady money and Red clearly could use the help. He has two gamblers working for him already and both of them are lousy.  Red is losing a lot of money each night and he needs the help of the man some call â€œThe Preacherâ€™s Kid.â€ The deal between them is struck and our hero best keep his wits about him at the poker table as well as away from it.That western mystery tale is followed by â€œLay My Money Down.â€ Told as a detailed reminiscence, the gambler spent some time in a really bad town known as Vinegaroon years ago. Possibly named after a scorpion, Vinegaroon is a place is on the Rio Grande somewhere west of the Pecos. The Sunset Railroad went through this hell hole as tracks were laid towards El Paso and that created a lawless boomtown of sorts.October and rain brought the gambler into town looking for a place to get dry and bed down for the night. Considering the town is mainly made up of huge tents huddled together and very few buildings, as well as what is on the floor of one of the salon tents, this isnâ€™t a place to linger. Finding a card game to occupy his time in this place might be a really bad idea. But, playing poker is what he does and there are games to be had.These two highly entertaining tales feature a hero that is complex, mysteries within a western setting, and plenty of action as the stories work through twists and turns. I Am A Roving Gambler: Two Stories Of The West by Bill Crider is a short read over way to fast as well as a good one.Material was purchased last month using funds in my Amazon Associate Account in order to read and review.Kevin R.

"The man known to others as Bryce Scott isnâ€™t thrilled about taking the â€œLovely Lane Sliver Shadowsâ€ bus trip to New Orleans. The possibility of a hurricane that is currently in the West Indies arriving at New Orleans isnâ€™t what concerns him. Not only is he doing to be forced to spend time with other people from a local area church  and talk to them, he is going to be forced into dealing with the very real possibility his cover has been blown.While it is October 1999 and years since he testified, the mob never forgets. The mob in this case is the Vicario crime family. Their capo, Boots Minelli, is in town. The only reason Bryce Scott has a chance to do anything is Boots Minelli has had a very public heart attack and is incapacitated. What he told the others is secondary to the very real major question Bryce faces---what does he do now to stay alive?As a hurricane gains strength and leads towards New Orleans, Bryce Scott takes the bus trip and makes plans to deal with ending the chase once for all. It has been a long time since he faced the Germans in World War II, but he isnâ€™t going down without a fight. How to do it without involving innocent passengers is just one of a growing list of problems he faces as the miles pass.This is an interesting mystery thriller style read that contains a few surprises. While it has less humor in it than the Greg McKenzie Mysteries do, there are the occasional small bits of humor. All and all, Hellbound by Chester Campbell is a good read that keeps the reader turning the pages to see how Bryce will deal with the killers after him as well as some of his fellow bus passengers. Some of them just might be as bad as the killers.E-book version supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"If you ever wanted to know more about garlic the book Garlic, An Edible Biography might be the book for you. As the subtitle makes clear the book is about The History, Politics, and Mythology behind the Worldâ€™s Most Pungent Food with over 100 Recipes. Written by Robin Cherry, travel writer and historian, the book is split into two sections regarding history and recipes.After an introduction from author Robin Cherry on how important and meaningful garlic has been to her, it is on to â€œPart One: The Story Of Garlic.â€ The four chapters in this section of over 100 pages explain the history of garlic in food, health, and literature, modern uses, and how to grow your own. Also included in this section are short bios of all the various garlic types which number far more than what you will ever find in your local store or produce market.â€œPart Two: Recipesâ€ begins on page 117 with a 4 page recipe list of all the recipes and their corresponding page numbers. That is followed by three pages on how to properly handle garlic before one moves on to â€œDips, Sauces and Condimentsâ€ on page 125-130.  All of that prepares you for â€œBread, Pizza, and Pastaâ€ (pages 141-146), â€œBeefâ€ (pages 197-202), â€œSide Dishesâ€ (pages 227-232) and more. Each recipe has an intro that often features a cooking tip or other advice that might include another history lesson, a list of ingredients needed, and instructions that include information on number of servings.An acknowledgement page, a two page bibliography, an 11 page index, and a one page short author bio bring this 265 page book to a close.While Garlic, An Edible Biography is interesting it suffers from two significant drawbacks. Surprising it does not contain any pictures of the various garlic types the book covers nor does it contain any pictures of the finished dishes. In addition to the lack of pictures that would have helped break up the bland and very dry text, there is zero nutritional information regarding fat/salt content or other possible dietary restrictions or needs.Garlic, An Edible Biography is quite the garlic resource. With the noted forgoing limitations, if you want to know quite a lot more about garlic and how to use it, this is a book worthy of your consideration.Garlic, An Edible Biography: The History, Politics, and Mythology behind the Worldâ€™s Most Pungent Food with over 100 RecipesRobin CherryRoost Books (Imprint of Shambhala publications, Inc.)http://www.roostbooks.com2014ISBN #978-1-61180-160-6Paperback (also available in e-book form)$16.95Material was picked up to read and review via the good folks of the Haggard Branch of the Plano Public Library System.Kevin R.

"Texas On The Table: People, Places, and Recipes Celebrating the Flavors of the Lone Star State does exactly what the title suggests in every way possible. Part of that is in the text by Terry Thompson-Anderson. Part of that is by way of the gorgeous photography by Sandy Wilson. The combination works incredibly well from start to finish.A cookbook that easily doubles as a coffee table book, this massive tome at more than 450 pages features a ton of recipes to take you through every meal every day of the year. Every meal, holiday or otherwise, is covered as are snacks and appetizers of all types. The pictures often paired with the detailed recipes tell the tale of the people and the land. Like a lot of cookbook this one does not have anything on fat/salt counts in the recipes or how to adjust any of the recipes based on dietary need.But, if you are going to eat â€œBison Enchiladas with Green Chile Crema, Pickled Red Onion Slaw, and Serrano Pico De Galloâ€ (pages 282-284) or nearly anything other delectable thing in this cookbook you probably are not really worried about fat or salt intake. You can always finish things up with â€œSan Sabu Texas Pecan Pieâ€ (437-438)  or â€œBananas Foster Cream Pieâ€ (page 436-438).A four page index as well as an eight page recipe index brings this visually stunning book to a close.Even if you donâ€™t cook or intend to use Texas On The Table: People, Places, and Recipes Celebrating the Flavors of the Lone Star State as a cookbook you will want this one for the photographs and history contained within this excellent book. Published by the University of Texas Press at $45 it pretty much works out to a buck a page.

"Originally seen in the short story, â€œThe Lawyerâ€ published in Protectors: Stories To Benefit Protect and in the Adventures Of Cash Laramie and Gideon Miles he returns here in The Lawyer: Stay of Execution. While Edward A. Grainger penned the original story, author Wayne D. Dundee penned this tale that takes the man known as â€œThe Lawyerâ€ on a new adventure.As the work opens, the man known as â€œThe Lawyerâ€ aka J. D. Miller is in pursuit of Lou Crenshaw. Unlike what he used to do in the courtroom before a tragedy was unleased upon him and his family, these days the man known as â€œThe Lawyerâ€  dispenses justice as he sees fit based on his own interpretation and definition of law. Often that is â€œjustice by the gun.â€ Crenshaw may be one of the men that were involved in the slaughter of Millerâ€™s family. Whether or not the nearby shots at the non-descript broken down farm were fired by Crenshaw is a question that has to be addressed.What isnâ€™t questionable is that, thanks to the lawyerâ€™s spyglass, he is able to spot three dead horses in the coral at the farm below him. The horses have not been dead that long. More importantly, one of the now dead horses is the same one that Lou Crenshaw had been riding the last few days. The horses arenâ€™t the only things that have been shot. A man and a woman are both down just outside the barn.As he watches he realizes the woman is alive and very pregnant. She is also clearly trying to help her husband. If Lou Crenshaw was trying to slow down his pursuer he has succeeded wonderfully as the chase will have to wait because these folks urgently need help.What follows is a typical Wayne D. Dundee western filled with interesting multi-dimensional characters, plenty of action and suspense, and a clear morality at work. This mighty good western is followed by the original short tale â€œThe Lawyerâ€ making the reading experience complete. Hopefully, this is the start of another great series much like the Cash Laramie/Gideon Miles series.Material supplied by Beat To A Pulp in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"As A Deadly Affair At Bobtail Ridge opens Samuel Craddock is awakened by a pounding at his door. His neighbor, Jenny Sandstone is on his porch and very upset.  Her mom, Vera Sandstone, apparently has had a stroke and has been rushed to a hospital in nearby Bobtail, Texas. Jenny needs to get to the hospital and wants Samuel to call Truly Bennett to take care of her horses. Despite his aversion to horses, Samuel takes care of them himself and before long he is at the hospital.Once there he comes upon an obvious confrontation of some sort in the hallway near Veraâ€™s room between Jenny and some guy who has gone so far as grab her arm. Chief of Police Sheriff Samuel Craddock inserts himself in the situation and learns the man is named Wilson Landreau. He is a public defender and Jenny refers to the whole incident as politics. Jenny makes it clear that not only is there nothing to talk about, she does not want Samuel Craddock involved in any way. One wonders how she would characterize Veraâ€™s cryptic warning to Samuel Craddock just a few minutes later about Jenny being in danger.Good thing he also knows a thing of two about police work while living in this South Texas rural area located in the middle of the triangle formed by Austin, San Antonio, and Houston. He has been Chief of Police for Jarret Creek before and while he did not really want the job again he is very good at it. It does not take long for Craddock to come to the conclusion that Vera may have been right in her warning. Jenny is clearly in a world of trouble on multiple fronts and refusing any and all offers of help. Who is messing with her and why are just two questions that need to be answered as things escalate. How current events link back to an unspoken horror from more than a decade ago drive the majority of this book.That is not to say that the various secondary storylines present in earlier books do not continue here.  They do which is why this excellent series should absolutely be read in order. Like any real good series, characters grow and evolve, relationship dynamics change, and people age as the books move forward in time. Of course, you could read this fourth installment in the series first, but you really need to go back to the beginning with the award nominated A Killing At Cotton Hill.ARC material requested and received for my use in an objective review via the Amazon Vine program.Kevin R.

"For Bill Travis, financial advisor and sometimes a bit more, everything started with Sol Gunderson's goats. The man has ten areas of land out of east of Austin, Texas. On the land he raises 40 or 50 Spanish goats. Now one is dead at the base of a hill on his property. It does not take Bill Travis long as he stared at the dead goat to figure out that something really bad and unnatural had happened to that goat.Sol Gunderson, who lives alone these days having divorced his wife Eloise after 25 years of not so wedded bliss, thinks that there is something radioactive down at the base of the hill. He thinks whatever is down there killed Bebe. Whatever did it two days ago has caused the goat to be nearly mummified with tufts of fur scattering away from the body all around and even as far as to the hogwire fence fifty feet away. Sol Gunderson is a bit odd to say the least, but he is also a millionaire many times over which is why Bill Travis keeps him as a client. Sol is also right that something abnormal killed that goat.Sol still cares deeply about Eloise, but his ex-wife does not want anything to do with him. She also is not interested in the dead goat or anything else involving her former husband, but does tell Travis there is a cancer cluster over in the subdivision across the creek from where Bebe died. She also tells Travis that it would be best to leave things alone. While she has her reasons and won't say what they are, she warns him off and tells him that those responsible would not hesitate to remove him as well as his family.Readers know from earlier books in this series, Travis isn't going to leave anything alone. Eloise just waved a red flag in front of a bull and while Travis may take some precautions he isn't about to stop investigating no matter what happens.After The Fire: A Bill Travis Mystery is the ninth book in the series which started long ago with The Last Call.  Author George Weir has put Travis through quite a lot and the same is true here in a very complicated tale filled with interesting characters, plenty of action, and more than one twist. A series that shows no signs of stopping After The Fire: A Bill Travis Mystery is another solidly good Texas sized mystery. While it could be read as a stand-alone, it would be far better to read this series in order.Material was purchased to read and review using funds in my Amazon Associate account.Kevin R.

"A woman who uses her feminine charms in such a way to gain leverage/money/power, etc. is said to be using a ""Honey Trap."" The Russians were very well known for this with several cases eventually making the news during the cold war. State secrets are not at stake in Honey Trap: A Noah Milano Short Story, but secrets almost at the same level are.Blake Trainor had been working as a chemist for years at one of the bigger companies in the perfume industry. Those formulas are closely guarded propriety information. The fact that he was recently divorced and lonely wasn't such a secret. That made him the target of an incredible hot young lady about a week ago as the story begins.That meeting in a Hollywood club led to Blake Trainor taking her home and having a very good time for the rest of the evening. When he woke up the next day, the good time was long over, and it was nightmare time. He awoke to find a note that the very sexy young woman was, in fact, a minor. Pictures had been taken and unless he sent the formulas to a certain email account the pictures would be given to the police.Blake Trainor certainly doesn't want to give up the formulas. He also knows that going to prison is a really bad idea especially for a guy like him. He does the one smart thing he can do and hires security specialist Noah Milano to find the young lady, get the pictures, and resolve the ugly mess.What follows is a quickly moving story of the hunt for the female blackmailer. A hunt that leads to quite a few complications along the way in this highly entertaining short story. At 13 pages this read is much shorter than The Death Business: A Noah Milano Novella  or Redemption: A Noah Milano Novelette, but provides a quick and excellent introduction to the Noah Milano character.Material was recently purchased to read and review using funds in my Amazon Associate account.Kevin R.

"Jory Ludek had a hard night of whoring and drinking and didn't expect to be woken up so early as he lay in a bed in one of the sleeping rooms of a cantina. His partner, a cantina girl who had been paid for her time and efforts, took one look at the large bearded man and his shotgun and silently fled the room as directed. Bounty Hunter Bodie Kendrick is the man directing her actions as he intends to take Joey Ludek back to Socorro in the New Mexico Territory dead or alive. While he would prefer to keep his prisoner alive, either way works for him as he intends to collect on the stated bounty on the wanted poster.Bodie Kendrick has a bit of a reputation in the early 1880's as does Ludek based on the wanted poster. With a couple of incidents in El Paso and Apaches on the warpath nearby Kendrick figures there is more than one reason to get the heck out of El Paso as fast as he and his prisoner can go. The title makes it very clear that it is going to be a brutally Hard Trail to Socorro.The first book of the Bounty Hunter Bodie Kendrick series this western read is a mighty good one. Filled with deceit and double cross, plenty of action, and a revelation or two Hard Trail to Socorro delivers a fine western from author Wayne D. Dundee known for his Joe Hannibal mystery series that this reviewer has yet to read (several of which are in the TBR pile). This award winning author has quickly gained a reputation for writing excellent traditional westerns. Hard Trail to Socorro is another example of that ability and a mighty good read.Material was either picked up awhile back via funds in my Amazon Associate account or when the author made the read free.

"While she has experience in family court as well as small claims, Jane Ciardi has never before interpreted in the criminal court. That will change today as her skills sign language interpreter are urgently needed as the usual interpreter is out because her husband had a heart attack. Sandra Blackmore, the remaining interpreter, plans on handling the deaf witnesses so she will voice as well as sign for them. She wants Jane to handle the witnesses that can hear. It will be a little easier on Jane as all she has do is sign when those witnesses testify so that those in the courtroom that are hearing impaired can understand what is happening in the trial.The case is emotionally charged as the assistant vice principal of the Cleveland School for the Death stands accused of the murder of the recently hired principal. While the assistant principal is deaf, the now deceased principal was not. The fact that somebody who was not deaf was hired to lead the school generated a lot of controversy with students and staff. That controversy resulted in intense media coverage. The situation has further escalated with the murder and subsequent trial as the media, as they usually do, are having a field day with the details of the murder case.A complicated murder case where everyone has their role to play in the short story Silent Witness by B. K. Stevens. This is a tightly woven intense read that was originally published in December 2010 in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine under the title Interpretation Of Murder.

"The concept of duty or responsibility is often a major part of the western world as envisioned by Wayne D. Dundee and that is certainly the case here in This Old Star. For more years than he cares to count Jeb Stander was the sheriff of Flatrock Crossing, Nebraska. He isn't the sheriff these days, but he still feels a duty to help out when the posse is out chasing Shake Whitley.There was a jail break and bank robbery back in town and several of the good people of Flatrock Crossing joined up with the current sheriff, Ben Tembow, to give chase. Shake Whitley is a crafty devil which is why the law has been chasing him for one thing or another the last dozen years. The posse has been hard at work the last two days and don't seem to getting anywhere. The weather has been nasty with rain and snow with no sign of the fugitive and the rest of the posse is just waiting for a reason to call it quits. Jeb offers to help and though Ben may not be thrilled with the prospect he isn't about to publicly say no.What follows is a complex story involving duty and responsibility in This Old Star. Like other very good westerns by this author, along with plenty of action there is an undercurrent about serious issues of the time that are just as valid today. Characters of complexity populate this author's work where a single action may have multiple meanings. The 2010 Peacemaker Award winning short story recently released in e-book form, This Old Star is another very good one.Material was picked up to read and review using funds in my Amazon Associate account.Kevin R.

"On the very cool cover of  Red Venus by Garnett Elliott there is a small quote from award winning author Bill Crider that reads, â€œElliot takes the Cold War into space in this rip roaring planetary adventure.â€ The clear implication is that it is a good book. It is so there is absolutely no point in a review from this reader as Bill Crider said it all.But, in case you want to know some details I offer my reviewâ€¦.After World War Two the Russians and the Americans both got ahold of schematics for the prototype V-5 rocket.  A rocket that was fission powered.  The Russians did the Americans one better and got their hands on an actual engine. Those discoveries created a space race. Efficient and high powered rockets opened up the new frontier with humans on Mars and Venus with mining efforts being made on Mercury and in the Asteroid Belt.It took two months for the Russian spaceship Krasnny Sokol to make it Venus from Earth. 27 year old Nadezhda Gura, captain of the ship and star of the Donetsk Flight Academy, is feeling the pressure of the situation. Onboard her craft is very important cargo that is part of a mission that must be completed at all cost. Damaged by orbital mines the ship and its crew barely survive a very dangerous and highly unorthodox landing. Considering what awaits them on the surface of Venus they might have been safer aboard the crippled ship in space.Filled with action and adventure, cool weapons, dangerous creatures and more, Red Venus is a terrific classic piece of science fiction pulp. Very reminiscent of some of the stuff I read at 2 am long ago when I was a teen, the tale works on all levels from start to finish. While Bill Crider said it best, I would also add---Itâ€™s Really Cool.Material was purchased to read and review using funds in my Amazon Associate account.Kevin R.

"If you have read Mike Monsonâ€™s work before such as The Scent Of New Death and What Happens In Reno you pretty know what to expect with Tussinland. You expect some seriously flawed human beings, plenty of violence, some sex, and a crime spree or two. Tussinland delivers on all that while mixing in some social commentary about life these days in the world of social media. It also explains how one might be able to use a certain cough syrup in a highly inappropriate way that is very contrary to all the warnings on the bottle and packaging.Of course, Paul Dunn does live in Modesto, California, his flaming disaster of a marriage is over, and he is forced to live with his very odd mother, Mavis while being unemployed due to a back injury. Fortunately, she does not own a motel, but her house is bad enough.  One canâ€™t blame him for wanting to use a certain cough syrup in mind altering amounts in order to escape reality.If things werenâ€™t bad enough for Paul, he is soon the number one murder suspect in the violent deaths of his ex-wife, Tina Dunn, and her new boyfriend, Mark Pisko. To the police and the average person reading the online news sites and commenting, it looks like Paul, despite the restraining order, made good on his threats to kill his ex and her lover. Being brought in for questioning by Detective Fagan is bad enough, but things are about to get way worse in this very twisted read.Tussinland is the latest example of Mike Monsonâ€™s deep love and affection for the city of Modesto, California and its people. Filled with very twisted characters---Paul might just be the most stable of the bunch--- plenty of violence, evil doers, and more, the book is one heck of a read that is also full of social commentary. It also seems to this reviewer that Tarantino ought to talk to Mr. Monson about a movie deal or two.E-book supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"By Blood Bound: The Smith & Sons Saga is a novella in three parts reflecting its publication as a series of short stories in the anthology Fathers: 12 Tales of the American West published by Western Trail Blazer Publishing.As the book opens Marshall Silas Smith is returning to the town of Clancy, Nebraska on a late October morning. The air is chilly for the forty-four year old Silas as well as his horses. For the men whose bodies are tied to the saddles of the horses he is leading back to town the temperature of the air or anything else no longer matters. Unfortunately that includes a young deputy by the name of Wiley Patton whom Marshall Smith took with him on the mission to track down and capture the two dangerous robbers. Marshall Smith, despite the painful task ahead of him to talk to the parents of the dead deputy, is glad to be back.That was until he was told by his chief deputy that a certain woman by the name of Mrs. Magda Corvelle has arrived in town by the way of the stage. She wants to see the Marshall as soon as possible and the news she brings is not good. Due to recent events the Marshall needs to take a leave of absence and return to Kentucky and see about his sons. Two boys who are now grown men and made it clear long ago they wanted nothing more to do with him after he came home from the Civil War. Whether they know it or not they need their Dad now more than ever and Silas Smith intends to get back into contact with his estranged sons.That will prove far more easily said than done for a variety of reasons.This western novella from Wayne Dundee is a very good one featuring plenty of action and angst. The main characters involved are flawed and yet, for the most part, decent human beings who are doing the best they can. That often happens at the barrel of a gun as the bad guys are many in this trilogy of linked short stories.If you are not reading the books of Wayne D. Dundee you are making a mistake. If you arenâ€™t, By Blood Bound: The Smith & Sons Saga is a good one to start on your Wayne D. Dundee reading list.Material supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"Growing up Michael â€œGypsyâ€ Moran could not wait to leave the isolated town of Wink in far west Texas. He would not be back now if not for a problem in Vegas that required him to make a very hasty departure. A problem that very well might have gotten him killed if he had stuck around.  A problem that came about because of his work as a private investigator.The last thing he needs now after driving 18 hours straight in his van with his few possessions is a case. But Rhonda, Gypsyâ€™s sister, is a force not to be denied. Rhonda, with the help of twelve year old Tatum, wants Gypsy to dig into the alleged suicide of Ryce McCallen. The deputy, who worked for the Winkler County Sheriffâ€™s Office before his death, was quietly investigating the disappearance of eight local girls. All were illegals which meant that other than the families involved---and sometimes not even them--- nobody besides Ryce McCallen cared enough to do something. The former deputy didnâ€™t involve his old department as he didnâ€™t trust them. He maintained an investigative file at home and said file is now in the possession of his twelve year old son, Tatum.It has been twenty years since Gypsy left Wink, Texas and swore never to return. It has been a little over two hours since he got back and Rhonda and his grandmother, â€œGramâ€ act like he never left and is still 18.  Nothing has really changed back home except he is a bit older and more aware sometimes when things donâ€™t feel right. The fact that the Sheriffâ€™s department made sure that the autopsy requested by the family was not done and handled all the funeral arrangements under the guise of helping the grief stricken family does not sit right with Gypsy. That fact and a few other things make Gypsyâ€™s taking of the case inevitable.Through in an old romance, long buried secrets, and the desolate landscape of west Texas in summer and the result is a complex mystery with multiple storylines and agendas. Authors such as Bill Crider and Terry Shames, among others, have done very well by writing about life in small Texas towns and the depravity that lurks behind closed doors before occasionally erupting into the open for all to see. Small town secrets and engaging characters drive their novels and the same is true here. You can easily add author Lynn Chandler Willis to the mix with a debut novel of what hopefully will grow into a steady series.Winner of the 2013 PWA Best First Private Eye Novel Competition, Wink Of An Eye: A Mystery, brings to life an intriguing cast of core characters, a complex mystery, and the desolate beauty of west Texas that can fry your brain in a heartbeat if the rattlesnakes donâ€™t kill you first. It does not matter how big your TBR pile is --- move this one on up there.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Public Library System.Kevin R.

"While Herbie isnâ€™t around these days, the diner with his name is still in business forty miles south of Sacramento, California. It is a good location if you donâ€™t want to work much during the off season as hardly anybody comes by on that lonely stretch of road. For private detective John Harwood, it is hard to be undercover and part of the back ground when your face has been used on bill boards and you are just about the only other customer in the diner.That is except for Mort Peters. Hardwood has been following Mort Peters all over northern California for a case. A case that is getting more complicated by the second now that Mort seems to have made him. The fact that the waitress drew attention to him certainly didnâ€™t help Harwood stay inconspicuous. Her name is Arlene and her behavior isnâ€™t helping nor is the chicken dinner by way of the cook, Muncy.Things get increasingly complicated in this novella mystery written by L. Joseph Shosty. Set in 1950 this heavily atmospheric tale features plenty of mystery and double crosses along with interesting characters and lots of action.  Herbieâ€™s Diner pays homage to the legendary radio style dramas of the past where nothing was as it seemed and the hard working average guy had to live by wits and fists.

"For most folks it was a calm Tuesday in Magnolia Parrish in southern Louisiana. For a few others, such as the unlucky folks who worked at the First Gold Bank it has been an hour plus of sheer terror on this mid-August day. A man walked in, robbed the place, and then attempted to leave only to be stopped by the first police officer dispatched to the scene as a result of a teller hitting the silent alarm. The bank robber fired a shot at the officer and missed before retreating back into the bank and taking hostages. Sergeant London Carter, a sniper, and the rest of his team from the Magnolia Parrish Sheriffâ€™s Office are tasked with dealing with the suspect and saving as many lives as possible.During the course of the operation one of their own is killed to the shock and horror of nearly every officer on scene. In the aftermath of the officer involved shooting Internal Affairs Lieutenant Bethany Riggs is brought into the lead the investigation into what happened. Was the death of Captain Landry a result of an accidental discharge by one of the snipers or was he killed by somebody else?Answering that question leads to a far bigger mystery in the new and very intense read James 516 by B. J. Bourg. Well known for his short stories and nonfiction work, this novel published by Amber Quill Press features complicated characters, plenty of action, and a mystery that works well from start to finish. The book opens in the thick of the action quickly grabbing the readerâ€™s attention with a complicated mystery, a romantic angle, an outside threat, along with several other ingredients. The author skillfully keeps the reader tightly focused into the book as he gradually ratchets up the tension to the final page.

"It has been four months of mind numbingly boring work since Morale Was Down. Nothing remarkable has gone on as things have been their usual daily boring routine. Avoid as much work as possible and stay out of the eyes of the bosses is still the basic plan and it works. Today is Friday and that means, unsurprisingly, that reports are down. Reports are always down on Fridays. You have also just been informed by e-mail memo to everyone in the building that due to ongoing issues with the aging plumbing system resulting in low water pressure, you are to use as little toilet paper as possible and flush often to reduce the chances of clogs. That is ridiculous, but it is what it is. There are also too many passwords, Stacy is being incredibly difficult, and you have paperwork to finish once you ease into your day by surfing around on Facebook for a bit.That plan is disrupted by Bob who canâ€™t be trusted and yet tells you that Alan wants a meeting. If Bob is not screwing with you, as he often does, the fact that Alan wants a meeting canâ€™t be good. You could check if your voicemail was working, but your password that worked last night is no longer valid. That means you canâ€™t access your voicemail.  Then Alan, Vice President of Technology and Finance Operations, actually walks into your office and catches you swearing at your phone. He most definitely wants you to come to his office for a meeting in a little over an hour.  Things are about to get very weird. Good thing you did solve the theft of the Stromboli four months ago.Second in the planned Close of Business trilogy, Effective Immediately is another funny mystery. Like the first one there is plenty of adult language as well as humor. In fact there are about 17,000 words in this short story and many of them are funny regarding the corporate life. The tale takes shots at numerous folks you will recognize from corporate life, but these same folks are also present in retail, academia, and elsewhere. Along the way it solves two mysteries while also explaining why you never go to the restroom on the same floor you work on---if you can help it.Material supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"8 pm and working on a broken sink in â€œCarlâ€™s Car Repair Shopâ€ isnâ€™t a lot of fun. It is New Yearâ€™s Eve which makes the job on the industrial sink a little bit harder. At the same time with a little girl and a spouse waiting at home at least the hefty fee makes it all worth it.Everything is okay until Police Chief Rob â€œThe Ratâ€ Ratner shows up. It has been 20 years, but one does not forget what happens to one during the teen years. Payback is a dish best served cold. It is also one heck of a way to start the New Year.Gail Farrellyâ€™s short story What Are You Doing New yearâ€™s Eve? is another good one from this talented author.

"After his adventure in the Isle of Mists Charles knew that the Dreadmen might be a serious problem.  He decided that he had to find their homeland which is known as â€œThe Fjord of Karlsgaard.â€ While Charles had no idea where the place would be thanks to Hero, his purple dragon, he has found it. He has also found at least some of the Dreadmen who are attempting to learn how to fly from the tall cliff walls above the fjord.It looks like these are some of the warriors from the nearby village. Despite the heights involved and the certainty of death should something go wrong, Charles and Hero watch as one after another takes the leap and relies on some sort of wing contraption that is harnessed to their bodies.  When it works they can achieve a flight reminiscent of birds as the soar down the fjord and then circle back to land on the beach far below. Despite the actions of Dreadmen they have encountered in the past when one begins to plummet towards a definite horrible death, Charles and Hero manage to save him seconds before impact.Their rescue action leads to a far more dangerous situation all the while the intentions of the Dreadmen became increasingly clear in Charles and Hero: The Dreadmen.The latest in the series that began with Charles and Hero: Charles of Colshire Castle-The Purple Dragon is another very good tale. Charles is a wonderful role model for the children readers the book is aimed for as he always sees the best in others. Even when pushed by negative forces or less than trustworthy characters, Charles manages a way to not only do the right thing, but show compassion to his adversary. Then there is Hero, the purple dragon. His thinking may be a little bit more black and white as to how he sees things, but a flying dragon is just flat out cool.The result is another great book from talented author Douglas Quinn. No matter the series, and he has several for different age groups, the book is always a positive read full of fun and adventure. Such is the case with Charles and Hero: The Dreadmen as well as the many other books author Douglas Quinn has out there for kids and the adults in their lives.Material supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"The end is near for LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. He has less than a year to the end of his career and isnâ€™t sure what the future holds. His latest case in the Open-Unsolved Unit (cold cases) features a victim who just died though he was shot over ten years ago. The bullet that ripped into Orlando Merced that fateful day did not kill him outright. Instead it lodged into his spinal column making him a paraplegic and a repeat customer of the medical system.He also became a political cause for a certain mayoral candidate. While that candidate is no longer Mayor, politics is a major reason why Bosch and his new partner Lucy Soto got the case. Politics is also why Lucy Soto is paired with Bosch. That pairing and Boschâ€™s willingness to help his partner is why another case will take precedence for large sections of the book.The latest in the long running series, The Burning Room is a complicated and yet fast moving read. While some have again criticized the evolution of the character and have claimed the author is phoning it in or has hired a team of ghost writers, neither is the case for those readers that are aware that the Bosch character has continued to evolve over 19 books. Inevitably those commenters seem to be longing for a book that appeared a decade or so ago and Bosch is now a far different character than he was then.Life has happened and while Bosch still clearly feels moral outrage and disgust his actions in regards to both are considerable more subtle in recent reads than a decade ago. He is also not surprised by anything a politician does at this point in his long career that has shown him repeated examples of the worst of the human condition. Despite the usual richness in detail there is a clear distantness to the novel as Bosch begins to wind down a career he so clearly loves. A very good read in all aspects the book leaves the reader wondering what the future holds for the beloved character as well as his creator.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Texas Public Library system who donâ€™t care what I say in a review.

"Karla Ercums claimed the pink amethyst ring on her finger was handed down to her by her grandmother. Drug Cop Ray Tabor is sure the ring is stolen though he canâ€™t prove it. Law enforcement can easily prove she stole other pieces of jewelry while working for Kleen Maid Service. Her actions as a thief as well as her desire for a shorter prison sentence means Tabor can use her as a snitch. In an area where everybody knows everybody else and most folks are related by blood, marriage, or both, Tabor is a definite outsider. He canâ€™t make a drug deal on his own and needs the help of locals who are not interested. Karla has no choice, as both she and tabor know, and he will use her as he sees fit.So the plan is for Karla to get into a meth house down in the Angelina River Bottoms. She is to wear a wire and make a buy. It should not be that hard or complicated, but things go sidewise. Good thing Karla can improvise and think on her feet.The repercussions of the above and their aftermath is the subject of the following tale titled â€œCranked.â€ One canâ€™t say more without telling too much and ruining the good read.Raining Willie & Cranked: Two Texas Tales features gritty characters deep into the drug trade and living on the edge where violence is common place. The short tales in this quick read are good ones where folks die, things get blown up, and things are more than a little twisted.

"It begins with missing dogs. The latest victim was Windy Butterfield who had two black labs stolen right out of his kennel. Butterfield knew a guy who knew Virgil and was willing to call him at three in the morning. By the next day Virgil Flowers is on the road to Trippton, Minnesota to see what is what.Lucas Davenport has more than enough on his plate with the Black Hole Case (see Field Of Prey) so Virgilâ€™s allowed even more freedom to poke around. That means he is still in the area when things that would get a higher priority investigation wise begin to happen.  Like a murder. Like an arson. As other events take precedence the theft of dozens and dozens of dogs of all types becomes a secondary storyline while Virgil works a case where folks are being killed and more.The eighth book in the Virgil Flowers series that began with Dark of the Moon is another good one. As usual, the language can be a bit much for some readers and there is plenty of sexual innuendo as Virgil works cases in multiple storylines. Readers are cautioned that if Field Of Prey  has not been read it -should be read before this book as there are numerous direct references to it and several of them are detailed enough to be considered spoilers.Beyond that, if you have read this series before you know what you are getting into and Deadline: A Virgil Flowers Novel is another good one. While it does not break new ground in the character, it does deliver exactly what one would expect from this very enjoyable series. If not familiar, make sure you read the earlier ones starting with Dark of the Moon so that you get the often dark humor at work in this series.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Texas Public Library System.Kevin R.

"Ben Kendall was known to be a hoarder. The piles of debris outside his home tended to indicate that. Anyone who looked inside would know it as well, but he allowed very few access. Once he finally made it home from Vietnam he had wanted to be left alone all these years. For the most part he had been. That meant he also did not get the help he needed to deal with the trauma of war and what he saw and experienced there as a combat photographer.Medical examiner Beverly Hillstrom did as much for Ben as he would allow over the years. With the recent discovery by a burglar of Benâ€™s decomposing body in his home, Beverly isnâ€™t really sure what happened to her first cousin. The Vermont State Police are handling the case. Having taken a look at the autopsy there are things that have her curious. Unfortunately, she does not have somebody like VBI agent Joe Gunther working for the state police. The good thing is she does have an increasing connection with Joe and he is willing to make a phone call. Another good thing is the fact that the lead investigator for the Virginia State Police, Owen Baern, is very open to Joe taking a look. That includes going out to the house and working their way into where Ben was found.It does not take long before Joe and Owen realize this is not a simple case of a hoarder being crushed to death by his own stuff. Somebody else, besides the burglar who reported the body, was in the house at the time of the death or shortly before. Hoarders are always rumored to have high value treasures buried in their homes. Whether somebody else was going after rumors of wealth and killed Ben several weeks ago or somebody was specifically searching for materials connected to the exhibition of photographs Ben took during the Vietnam War is open to debate. Not only is it important to figure that out to bring Benâ€™s killer to justice, considering the fact that Beverlyâ€™s daughter, Rachel, was involved in getting the photographs displayed as part of a well-publicized art exhibit, she could be in danger if the photographs and other things she has been working with are the target of the killer or killers.With a series that began in Open Season the latest in Joe Gunther series showcases the continuing evolution of the characters themselves as well as in their relationship to each other and society as a whole. This is a series that should definitely be read in order. It is not a static series where folks donâ€™t age and change. Instead, it is one where those involved continue to change-- sometimes in large ways -- as folks in the real world do as events and situations occur. That life like aspect coupled with a solidly good mystery make Proof Positive: A Joe Gunther Novelâ€ as well as the many other books in the series excellent reads.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Texas Public Library System.Kevin R.

"As author Craig Johnson explains in â€œacknowledgementsâ€ the stories in â€œWait for Signs: Twelve Longmire Storiesâ€ come from his annual holiday treat for his newsletter subscribers. Not only were they previously published in that sense several were also previously published in the small 2012 publication titled Christmas in Absaroka County: Walt Longmire Christmas Stories. Some of the stories are mysteries or have something a little mysterious going on and others are more slice of life type stories featuring Sheriff Walt Longmire of Absaroka County, Wyoming. A fact that is also noted in the introduction written by Lou Diamond Phillips that follows.Then it is on to the stories which begin with â€œOld Indian Trick.â€ An award winning tale that starts off with a routine trip for Sheriff Walt Longmire and Lonnie Little Bird to Billings so that Lonnie Little Bird can have his routine diabetes checkup at Deaconess Hospital.  They stop for food and a break at the Blue Cow Cafe on the Crow Reservation. Before long any chance to go on up to Billings this day is out of the question.Walt Longmire is also on the road as the next story â€œMinisterial Aidâ€ beings. It is just before dawn on January 1, 2000 and he is headed to Powder Junction located about 45 minutes away from the county seat of Durant, Wyoming. He is driving the 100 miles round trip to deliver deputy Turk Connally his paycheck. While delivering the check at the empty station the phone rings. Instead of letting the phone call roll over to Turkâ€™s rented house and waking him up on New Yearâ€™s Day, Longmire decides to answer the call and give his deputy a holiday break. It is an impulse he will come to question almost as much as his clothing choice of only wearing a robe.A small part of the previous story is the fact that it has been only a few months since Longmireâ€™s wife, Martha passed due to cancer. That situation is a major part of the very powerful tale â€œSlick-Tongued Devil.â€New Yearâ€™s Eve and Sheriff Walt Longmire is at the Durant Home for Assisted Living. His old boss and occasional chess opponent, Lucian Connally, apparently left a space heater to close to the curtains in his room, causing some damage. Known for his cantankerous ways, Longmire is there to help keep things calm and peaceful. That is not going to be easy since Lucian hates having to sit in the communal area with everyone else. It certainly does not help Lucianâ€™s mood that he is afraid he is losing his mind in â€œFire Bird.â€Mental stability is part of several stories in the book and aspect of the preceding one. It is also a factor â€œUnbalancedâ€ which also uses Sheriff Walt Longmire on the road traveling to get things started. Cady is on the way home for the holidays and is scheduled to arrive in Billings just before midnight. Sheriff Walt Longmire is on the way to the airport with his always present canine companion, Dog, at his side.  He stops as at empty gas station where the pumps will take a credit card after hours in Garryowen, Montana to get gas. Clearly, the young woman sitting on the bench needs help on this incredible cold night. The question is whether or not she will take it.The aftermath of a truck crash on the snowy interstate in â€œSeveral Stationsâ€ could have been worse. The driver who rolled the semi did so at slow speed and escaped unhurt though as a precaution he has been taken to the hospital. The truck and its cargo of toys did not fare so well on this Christmas Eve. As the snow continues to fall and a wrecker is at least 45 minutes way, Walt Longmire is left alone to babysit a crash scene that should remain quiet. One just knows it wonâ€™t.Sometimes folks accidently drive off without paying for gas. The department has a way of handling those situations in â€œHigh Holidays.â€ They also have a way of dealing with things when they escalate.Cady has just arrived for the holidays in â€œToys for Tots.â€ She wants to make a stop at the local mall in Billings before they head home. Longmire made the mistake of telling her they could go shopping when she came home for holidays and now she is calling him on it.Unlike many of these preceding stories which are set around Christmas, â€œDivorce Horseâ€ is set on the Memorial Day weekend. It has been few months since Walt nearly died in the Bighorn Mountains chasing the convicts, Vic seems to be sticking around, and soon to be married Cady has a few questions in mind. That is all going to have to take a back seat to trying to figure out what happened to Tommy Jeffersonâ€™s horse.It is Thanksgiving and Longmire and Dog are at Red Pony with Bear who is cooking the traditional dinner. They are not going to be alone for long in â€œThankstaking.â€Henry, Dog, and Bear are coming back from a fishing trip with a cooler of trout in â€œMessenger.â€ They are going to need them to rescue Ranger Chuck Coon and a civilian from a possible bear attack.  Rescuing them will be the easy part.The book closes with a new story, â€œPetunia, Bandit Queen of the Big Horns.â€ Sheep are involved in this tale that has far more to do with inner character of people than anything else.The 12 tales of Wait for Signs are all good ones. Mysterious in many cases, they all show various small details of the Walt Longmire character and his motivations regarding people, animals, and cultures. All of the short stories in the book are good ones well worth your time as are the novel which began with â€œThe Cold Dish.â€ If you have not read the novels, Wait For Signs: Twelve Longmire Stories is an excellent introduction to the character that has garnered so many fans worldwide.Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Texas Public Library System.Kevin R.

"Blending a bit----and sometimes a lot--- of the supernatural with the western, author Heath Lowrance created Hawthorne Tales Of A Weirder West. This is a west long before it became civilized when things moved in the night.  Native peoples knew what areas to stay away from and did so while the white man failed to see the signs. A west of old where one man with a cross cut into the top of his head made it his mission to destroy evil in its many forms.After an introduction by author James Reasoner, the book is primarily broken into four parts before being concluded with a short story.  Each part contains a story further split into two parts or chapters. As Reasoner tellingly notes in the introduction â€œSharp things lurk ahead.â€He neglected to mention they will often be foul and disgusting or that Hawthorne really needed a big time flame thrower instead of a Smith & Wesson Schofield .45. There are very bad things out there and Hawthorne is almost always the only one dealing with some seriously evil things.It begins with â€œThat Damned Coyote Hill.â€ Hawthorne had been warned in the last town not to go to the next town called Coyote Hill. That there were things there with demons, black magic, and maybe way more than that. Even though he saw something in the surrounding desert that should have scared off anyone, Hawthorne kept going right into town.  Before long a fight, a kidnapping, and out of this world justice and more play out in this complicated two part tale.â€œThe Long Black Trainâ€ features a large man who just boarded the Denver & Rio Grande train in Denver. He also carries a large rat on his shoulder that is unseen by anyone else. While the rat may or may not exist, the man has serious plans for everyone on board the train, including Hawthorne when he intervenes in this two part tale.Hawthorne finds what is left of the Lakota camp in the Black Hills one fall afternoon. It initially appears to him that it was the work of the Army. After he examines a couple of the bodies he realizes something else is at work in â€œThe Spider Tribe.â€ He will need the help of the two remaining survivors if he and they are to survive in this very creepy two part tale.The final part is titled â€œBad Sanctuaryâ€ and involves a two part story set in the ruins of Fort Mason. Plague drove the Army out of the fort the year before and never came back. The local Indian population, the Utes, donâ€™t come within ten miles of the place.  A few outlaws and others make the abandoned fort home because they donâ€™t have the smarts the Indians had. Hawthorne knows there is something evil at the fort. Whether it has anything to do with the man he is tracking is another thing.The stories end with the short tale â€œThe Unholy; Or, How the Gowan Gang Diedâ€ that tells the quick story of what happened and why. Compared to the rest of the stories in the book the violence depicted is tame by comparison as is the supernatural angle. The story flows quickly and wraps up the book nicely.Combing the western with plenty of flat out strange Hawthorne Tales Of A Weirder Westâ€ is heavy into the weird. Those who are very much into horror will find plenty to like about this read. Those of us who arenâ€™t will appreciate more the science fiction and fantasy elements at work here. The tales are good ones and will burn their images though your brain. That is when you are not laughing from time to time at the dark humor dryly present in each tale.Material supplied by the publisher a long time ago for my objective review.Kevin R.

"Told from the perspective of a cat that prefers to be considered â€œfelineâ€ because he is house broken, this short story mixing humor and mystery is an enjoyable read. The cat----or feline---in question goes by â€œGratefulâ€ as his full name is â€œGrateful Dead.â€ He is okay with the name though, if he had a choice, he would have gone with Elvis since his great grandmother lived at Graceland and there are other family connections. Itâ€™s a good life as his pet is Annie (his owner) and Grateful has a favorite female feline, â€œFluffsterâ€ close by.Annie isnâ€™t happy much at all these days. In large part Grateful blames Annieâ€™s boyfriend Robert Dumbrowski. They were high school sweethearts back in the day. In the here and now he is with a struggling band, calls himself Rocky Dove, and wants to be a rock star. When he isnâ€™t around to boss Annie, he spends a lot of time out on the road doing whatever. Home or on the road he is not really around to help Annie who is a struggling artist with very little income. Also against him in the mind of our feline narrator is the fact that he doesnâ€™t like felines. Grateful also does not much care for Annieâ€™s mother and for good reason. But, Rocky Dove is the biggest problem in Annieâ€™s life according to Grateful.From the start, Rockyâ€™s latest visit to town proves Grateful Deadâ€™s point. The feline has quite a few other observations about life and more while also managing to solve a mystery in â€œAnnie And The Grateful Dead: A Short Story.Originally written as â€œa story to benefit the international fund for animal welfareâ€ this is a fun read that blends some mystery, quite a lot of humor, and more into a quirky tale. It isnâ€™t clear in the beginning where the story is headed, but once the ground work is laid for the mystery, the short story powers along quickly working things out. Well worth it, Annie And The Grateful Dead: A Short Story should be on your short story reading list.Picked up this material during the authorâ€™s recent free read promotion to read and use in an objective review.Kevin R.

"Well known for his excellent River City Series of police procedurals set in the Seattle area, author Frank Zafiro moves the action to Texas In The Shadow Of El Paso. Published in 2012 the book contains two short stories set in the fictional Texas city named â€œLa Sombraâ€ located just outside El Paso. As many folks in the border country know, laws and more get blurred along the border.Something pointed out in the opening tale â€œIn The Shadow Of El Paso.â€ Being a lawman in La Sombra is a bit different than elsewhere. Carl Riggins is a transplant to the area and after three years is still considered an outsider and maybe something worse. Being in love is also bit different.  Isabella is the object of our lawmanâ€™s affection. She is beautiful and she serves drinks at Tres Estrellas almost every night. It is one a few place where white and brown can get along with little trouble---most of the time. This Tuesday night violence erupts and Deputy Carl Riggins is one of the first dispatched to the scene. His arrival puts a friendship is put to the test and more in this compelling story of love, racism, fate, and more.Following that read is a tough act, but â€œJackâ€™s Townâ€ makes it work. Deputy Carl Riggins is dispatched to handle a possible domestic at the home of Jack and Doris Talbot. Jack is the richest man in La Sombra and probably the entire county. He owns a lot of land, a cattle ranch, and a car dealership and quite a few other things including his wife. Like a lot of very wealthy people, Jack Talbot has a bit of a reputation and not all of that is positive. Upon responding to the house Deputy Carl Riggins knows something bad has happened. It is going to be dealt with, as are consequences, one way or another.Author notes/explanations of a couple things in the stories followed by promotional material for other books by the author bring the read to a close.While â€œIn The Shadow Of El Pasoâ€ was previously published in the 2007 anthology Map of Murder the following story â€œJackâ€™s Townâ€ is a previously unpublished tale. It picks up a few months after the first story and is just as compelling as the first. Taken together the complicated stories work as book ends that consider societal issues along the border and society as a whole while working that chemistry dynamic between a man and a very beautiful woman. Along with the mysteries at work in each tale, at their core each tale is about far more than the mystery that is eventually solved. An incredible amount is at work here in this excellent read.Material supplied by the author a very long time ago in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"As in these times, just after the Civil War there were men in prison for crimes they did not commit. Lucas Fume is one such man serving time in the Tennessee State Prison. Convicted of the murder of his business partner, John Barlow, Lucas has done a lot of questionable things over the years. This was especially true during the Civil War. His guilt on that is one thing, but he never murdered anyone.Fortunately, Lucas Fume is a better than average good fighter and has earned a reputation of being one of the toughest guys in the prison. A reputation that somebody is looking to take down a notch as there was no other reason for the stranger to come after him. Lucas has taken some shots, but given as well as he has gotten and is holding his own against his latest attacker. As the fight rages on while prisoners place bets on the outcome, a fire has begun elsewhere close by in the prison. That fire and the commotion it has caused have turned what was a simple fight between two prisoners into a free for all between many of the men.It also means others that Lucas has no idea who they are have moved into range of Lucas. That includes a former slave and fellow prisoner by the name of Ezekiel â€œZekeâ€ Henry. He has come looking for Lucas for a reason as he started that fire as part of a plan to free Lucas from prison. There really isnâ€™t time to ask questions though Lucas tries as the fire increases and guards beginning to respond to take control of the prison back from the inmates and quell the violence.  Why he is being sprung now is just one of the many questions in Lucasâ€™ mind as he takes a chance and follows Zeke in the unknown.First of a new series featuring Lucas Fume, this western is a good one. Like most of author Larry D. Sweazyâ€™s main characters, Lucas is a flawed human being who has done a number of things that others would question and quite possibly hang him for. He is a complicated human being, but his word means just about everything to him.Couple that with a strong mystery component which is usually present in the authorâ€™s westerns, a compelling secondary storyline, and other ingredients and you have more of the quality read that worked so well in The Devilâ€™s Bones and the Josiah Wolfe, Texas Ranger series. When you read a Larry D. Sweazy book it isnâ€™t surprising why the author collects so many awards for his work. He has done it again with Vengeance At Sundown: A Lucas Fume Western.Material supplied by the author in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"Imagine, if you will, a world where it is possible to go back in time to play golf in relative safety while dinosaurs move around you. That idea is just a small part of the three highly entertaining tales in Carnosaur Weekend. The three tales in the book are all good ones and highly entertaining.â€œCarnosaur Weekendâ€ opens the book where pterodactyls fly above the golf course and an allosaurus and a carnosaur are on the fairways. A RPG is a most helpful weapon in times like this where the super-rich are being courted by real estate developers selling time shares in the late cretaceous period. Those running this deal somehow got their hands on a â€œZygma Projectorâ€ making their very questionable venture in the timeline possible. Damon Cole is already working the case in the far distant past and is under deep cover. Kyler Knightly is being sent in to assist because the deal has to be shut down before they screw up the past and cause irreversible changes in the present.â€œThe Zygma Gambitâ€ comes next and was also published in the very good The Lizardâ€™s Ardent Uniform and Other Stories. Set a bit before the preceding story, Kyler Knightly is one of those very special people known as â€œdreamersâ€ and is employed by Continuity Inc. Through their dreams the dreamers have the ability to foresee the future. Kyler has been awakened by a dream in his own bed in the early morning hours of April 14, 2223. For this to happen outside of the Precog bays where he normally works means that this dream was very powerful and definitely coming true. Kyler has to get to his Uncle Damon Cole and tell him about the dream before Cole goes on his mission.The final story title â€œThe Worms of Terpsichoreâ€ is very good and highly reminiscent of the classic type of science fiction many of us grew up on. The spaceship Sallust sent off a one word message via their orbital beacon and then went radio silent. No further transmission has come from where they landed on the surface. The one word message also does not make sense. Clearly, something has happened.  Raj and Thea will go down to the site by way of a lander from their spaceship known as the Astarte. This type of search and rescue mission is just part of what they do as members of â€œFrontier Swift Response.â€ While this isnâ€™t at time travel story and Damon Cole and Kyler Knightly are not involved at all, it is still a very good tale. After all, any story that uses a flame-gun is automatically pretty good.Author Garnett Elliotâ€™s bio and ads for other books from Beat To A Pulp including installments of the excellent Jack Laramie Drifter Detective series finish out the book.The three science fiction tales in Carnosaur Weekend quickly yank readers to a very different time and place. The multiple characters involved have considerable depth that never gets in the way of the science fiction adventure. These are adventures when anything is possible as the dangers are many and one has to stay alive by oneâ€™s wits. The tales of Carnosaur Weekend are all very good ones very much worth your time.Material supplied by the publisher in exchange for my objective review.Kevin R.

"This is a handy little battery pack.  What sets it apart from the growing field of packs (search and you will find lots) is the attached charging cables.

"The Pencil stylus is hands down the best stylus I have used with any tablet. The carper tee pencil shape takes a bit to get used to, but it is a good design offering a variety of grips.

The tip has enough give to make it very nice for writing and drawing. Paired with the free Paper app, the Pencil shines - you can use the eraser like any eraser and easily access a host of app features.

"This is not your Dad's slot racer or your kid's video game - it's a melding of generations of gaming into a very fun hybrid.  Yes, it's expensive and yes, there are still some kinks to be worked out - but it sure is a good time.  Like slot racing, you don't have to worry too much about steering control of the cars - just tilt to choose your inside/outside lane position and the car does all the driving for you.  Like modern gaming, there are upgrades, achievements and objectives beyond the lapping wins.The implementation is good and I hope subsequent software iterations will continue to improve performance.  We have cars that seem to lose their minds sometimes and head the wrong direction, and cars that go zooming off the track (problematic when playing on a table).  Given the high-tech nature of the cars, I remain concerned about these flying leaps, but so far it hasn't been a problem.  I would imagine this has something to do with the relatively basic, ABS-heavy styling.FYI, the system is based on Bluetooth-LE (low energy), which is why older iOS devices won't work, regardless of their processors.  Overall, it's a great time.  The cost of melding generations of gaming is not low.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VL3S1BJ4I6VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6MWM1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3VL3S1BJ4I6VO","A3SIFPKLMOY07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SIFPKLMOY07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We -think- it also helps keep clothes from getting the worst of the odors, but we haven't done the kind of side by side comparison I'd need to feel confident that was true and not just a placebo effect.

However, the big advantage here is wireless.  The ability to set up the scanner in a moderately remote positioning is awesome for things like document productions and other mobile scanning jobs where a wired connection is a hassle.

"Generally I'm not a huge fan of stylii that want to be both a stylus and a pen and I think the need for them nowadays is pretty thin - I rarely go from tablet to paper in one sitting.  Moreover, this instrument sports one cap for the two ends - so either the pen or the soft rubber nib is exposed (and subject to wear).

"This is another entry into the burgeoning mobile speaker market.  Sound is good and it has a stylish appearance.

The Tunz also offers the option to charge your phone or other device via a USB port on the back - which is a differentiating feature from other bluetooth speakers.

Bright enough to use in a room that is well-lit (3,000 lumens), but without the washed out, white out effect that you often get from running a projector at full brightness.  Instead, you get even light and colors that pop.  The options for running this with a series of projectors are stunning - this is a tool for serious presentations.  The wifi is very cool and makes it easy to run the projector on an ad hoc basis where anyone can connect without cables.

"Overall, this is a very versatile steam cleaner and we like it a lot.  The myriad attachments allow us to use the cleaner in ways and places that we could never do with our stick-mop style cleaner.  Presumably because of the tank capacity, it does take the full 8 minutes to get up to steam, but it keeps that head of steam all the way through to the end of the tank even with continuous use.We have been running full tankloads of 40-45 minutes aggressively cleaning wood floors and it does a very good job with two caveats.  First, the floor extension (plastic) doesn't seem to stand up well to aggressive mopping action.  Second, the velcro-like method for attaching the pads doesn't keep them very secure when mopping - and the pads don't look like they will last very long before needing replacement.  Perhaps the answer is a lighter mopping action, but it seems that scrubbing pads are for scrubbing.

"This speaker really hits the sweet spot for size and sound in a bluetooth speaker.  Large enough to give good sound, but small enough to be used as a mobile speaker (not just portable).  It is maybe half the size of Creative Airwave HD Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with NFC (Charcoal Grey).  I think the Creative has slightly fuller sound, but its large size makes it less mobile.  There's a companion app for the Mini Boom that allows you to run two of them either in stereo or as two simultaneous mono units.

"This is a solid bargain case for the 7"" Kindle Fire 5th Generation. The Fire fits securely in the case, but it's not so tight that it's hard to get it in and out. It has an elastic loop to hold the stylus. It has a magnetic closure that keeps the cover closed. You can easily access all ports and buttons. The cover folds over and fits into a slot in the back to create a stand. For the stand to be useful, it needs to be on a flat surface. You also need to make a few adjustments as you figure out how far to push the cover into the slot to create the most stable stand.

"I received this faucet for free to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.We're currently living in a rental property, and the kitchen faucet that came with the property was horrible for someone who is constantly working in the kitchen. Recently, the faucet had started to leak due to mineral build-up. Our landlord said we were on our own if we wanted a new faucet. When we rent, I generally change out the faucet for one that works for our needs. I want something that looks nice, is affordable, and has great function.The most difficult part of the installation of this faucet was removing the old one. The old lines and fittings were all corroded which was a pain when the under-the-sink cabinet is small. Once I removed the old faucet, the installation of the new faucet was straight forward and fairly easy. The included instructions were easy for me to follow. Because the instructions were generic for their faucet lines, there were a few inconsistencies on how to do some things, but I didn't find it to be a big deal. I actually like the style of the weight on this hose as it doesn't require any tools to remove, adjust, and install it.The faucet comes with pretty much everything you need for installation including supply lines and plumbers tape. You will just need some basic tools like an open wrench, screwdriver, and socket. You may also need silicone caulk to seal around the faucet (if desired).The faucet does not come with a base plate, so if you have multiple openings in your sink, you'll either want to add soap dispensers (like I did) or purchase a base plate to cover the additional holes. For ease of use, I installed the faucet handle at the front of the unit as having it at the side when using soap dispensers made it a little tight. My family also likes it up front as it makes it easy to use when your hands are messy.The faucet is roughly 20.5"" from the base to the highest point. It extends roughly 10"" from the nut in the back to the largest point on the sprayer when attached to the arm. The faucet with the arm rotates freely which gives a lot of flexibility in use of the unit. I like that if I need more space around the sink for large pots, I can swing the arm to the side and the sprayer can just retract to the upper ""spring"". The button on the sprayer head is a nice size which makes it simple to switch quickly to the sprayer mode. We have much better water pressure with this faucet than we did with our previous unit.Overall, we're all enjoying this new faucet. It looks great in the kitchen and works well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37N5IR0WKG0AM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UX38SQ2#wasThisHelpful","R37N5IR0WKG0AM","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free screen protector to provide feedback based upon my experience with it.Recently, I purchased a 7"" Kindle Fire for my daughter after her old tablet died. We've always used the wet application screen protectors on our phones and tablets, so I immediately went looking for one that would fit my daughter's new Fire. Shortly after my search began, I was given the opportunity to receive this one, so I figured that I would give it a try even though it wasn't our normal brand.I was pleased with the ease of installation. While I may just be getting better at installing these, I felt this one went on easier than ones in the past. After cleaning the screen really well, I was able to get it on without bubbles by using the enclose squeegee. I have one small mark in the corner where a dog hair got between the screen protector and the tablet. When I went to remove it, I forgot to wet my fingers first which caused a slight mark in the sticky surface of the tablet. Since it doesn't cause any issues due to location, I chose to leave well enough alone and not try to repair it.After allowing it to sit the required number of hours prior to use, we found that there was only a slight decrease in the sensitivity of the screen. My daughter is quite pleased that the screen is now protected. If the screen protector does get damaged, the company has a guarantee, so we can get a replacement which I like.The screen protector covers almost the entire screen. It's just slightly shy of going all the way to the edges which is fine. The opening for the camera lines up just right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PK3GXZKOFE3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GJ1GM0#wasThisHelpful","R2PK3GXZKOFE3O","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received mixed reactions from my dogs on this toys dispenser. They love their Kong toys, so I thought this would be a hit. Unfortunately, my one dog wanted nothing to do with it, and the other dog thought it was okay. He pushed it around and dispensed the treats as he wanted them, but then he completely ignored it. Basically, he did the minimum he could to get the reward. It appears that both dogs prefer the softer material that the Kong is made of rather than the hard plastic of this toy.That being said, this dispenser is well made. It's colorful and rolls around well over different surfaces. It's roughly 15 1/4"" in circumference with 2 roughly 13/16"" diameter openings. You don't want to put in anything wet/sticky as it would be difficult to clean out the interior, but the exterior is easy to clean as it's not porous.

"I purchased this at half off to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.My original intent with this balaclava was to wear under a motorcycle helmet to provide some protection from the dust that gets kicked up while riding in dirt. I could easily pull it up over my mouth/nose while driving or pull it down when it got a little too warm. It provided good protection. While the ponytail feature is nice, I found it didn't work for me with the helmet due to the high placement on the head.What I did find is that this was nice for a base layer when the temps started to drop. When not wearing a helmet, the ponytail hole worked nicely for keeping my hair off my neck. (It even works for my daughter who has really thick hair. She too wishes that the ponytail hole was lower on the balaclava as she doesn't wear her ponytail that high up on her head.)

"I purchased this at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.My husband has a heavier weight balaclava, but he wanted one that he could wear under his motorcycle helmet. He needed something that would protect from the wind/dust, but not be too warm in hot weather. This one fits nicely and works well as it has a longer neck which allows it to be tucked inside of a shirt/jacket. It stays in place and doesn't move. While the material is stretchy, it does not stretch out after repeated use. It's breathable, but provides protection from the elements while riding. It's well made and washes well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FU2O3BMANNT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0YA5GM#wasThisHelpful","R1FU2O3BMANNT4","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these to use with my Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven. I wanted to be able to continue baking and cooking when it was hot or when I didn't want to use the large oven. At 13"" x 9 1/2"" x 1 1/8"", they are a perfect size to bake and cook in the toaster oven. For baking, I use with parchment paper, so clean-up is quick and easy. I've found that I get even baking with these baking sheets. For cooking, I don't line them. Unless I'm cooking with something really sticky, the pans are easy to clean up. If I cook something sticky (think honey chicken or bbq), a little soak and a good scrub cleans them up nicely. I wash them both by hand and in the dish washer with no issues. I used these almost daily for a little over a month, and other than having a more dull finish, they look great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFR08E8P84YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YKGRMS#wasThisHelpful","R3PFR08E8P84YN","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this cookie cutter set at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with them.This piece set of roughly 3"" cookie cutters is basically an upgraded version of your traditional metal cookie cutters. They have a silicone top which makes use more comfortable. The silicone top can be removed for easier cleaning of the metal cookie cutters. There are no small areas in these cookie cutters which means no pieces to break off. I was even able to use them with brownies. The set contains some of the most traditional cookie cutter shapes - heart, ""flower"", gingerbread man, and star.

In the summer, she's all about caps while the cool weather draws her towards cute, warm hats.

She loves that she can wear her hair in a braid, french twist, or ponytail and still be able to have the hat cover her ears. It stretches without getting stretched out. The black buttons look great against the natural, cream. The pom-pom at the top is fun.

"I received a discount on this set of jars to provide feedback based upon my experiences with them.We use a lot of honey around our house, and I was looking for an alternative to just storing the honey in a mason jar for daily use. (I buy raw honey in bulk and transfer it to mason jars.) Regular honey pots do not keep the ants out, so we've been using mason jars and honey bears. I personally don't care for the honey bears as they are plastic and can't be safely heated for decrystallizing the honey.This honey jar is the best of both worlds. The jar is made of glass while the screw-on top and honey dipper is made of plastic. The handle with the built-in honey dipper has a seal around it which keeps the ants out of the honey jar. I love the fact that I don't need to screw off the lid every time that I need to use the honey. Using a honey dipper rather than a squeeze bottle can be a little more messy - especially with kids, but I actually like it better.The syrup jar has a handle with a built-in silicone brush. I'm using it with coconut oil. Right now, the room temperature is warm enough that the coconut oil is in liquid form. As the temps drop, the coconut oil with start to solidify at room temp, so it's nice to have the glass jar as I can quickly warm it up to melt the coconut oil. Thanks to the built-in brush, I can quickly grease my baking pans without needing to use a spray.While the colors aren't the first choice for my kitchen as I prefer red accents colors, they are nice. The set it easy to clean. The jars including the lids/handles are just over 6"" tall with a diameter of a little over 2 1/2"". They are a really nice size as they don't take up too much space on the counter or in the cabinet. While they can hold 250 ml, you won't want to completely fill them up due to the displacement caused by adding the dipper/brush to the contents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MA71XRJAUNYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z75BWL4#wasThisHelpful","R1MA71XRJAUNYT","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these straws at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with them.This set of 4 steel straws are just under 8 1/2"" long with a diameter of roughly 7/16"". They are perfect for thick milkshakes, smoothies, and bubble tea. They are durable and easy to clean (if cleaned right away) with the included straw brush. If they don't get cleaned right away, you can give them a good soak in soapy water and then scrub them with the brush. While you can put them in the dishwasher, I find they don't get cleaned that well, so I stick with handwashing them.My daughter is sensitive to cold, so she found these didn't work well for her with milkshakes as the straw got too cold. On the other hand, she loved them for smoothies though as they aren't as cold. She liked that it was easy to drink even thick smoothies with these straws.If you're looking for an alternative to disposable straws, these straws are a solid option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XRBJ8NZD9YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPVAIOC#wasThisHelpful","R35XRBJ8NZD9YU","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had to give up Cheerios when we went gluten free many years ago, but I'm thrilled that we can now have Cheerios again. While these aren't made with gluten free oats, the company created a process that made the oats safe for those who need to be gluten free. They chose to go this route because there just aren't enough gluten free oats available for their production needs. Basically, they took the approach of see a need, fill a need. My daughter is thrilled to be able to eat Honey Nut Cheerios as they make a great snack when she's working on her studies.Ingredients: Whole Grain Oats, Sugar, Oat Bran, Corn Starch, Honey, Brown Sugar Syrup, Salt, Tripotassium Phosphate, Rice Bran Oil and/or Canola Oil, Natural Almond Flavor.

"I received this solar light at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experience with it.We're currently testing out different solar lights to use around our horse stalls, so we'll be able to see to take care of them when the longer nights of winter set in. We needed lights that were solar, had a motion sensor, and provided plenty of light for feeding and other routine chores. We also needed to make sure that it would provide light in both the evening and the morning which means it needs to hold a charge throughout the night and into the early morning hours.This particular solar light looks nice. It has a slim, classic look. The casing has proved to be durable. This light, unlike some other solar lights, hangs on a single screw (like you would see with a picture), so you can easily take it down and change the setting if desired. You don't need to uninstall it to make changes. It only has two settings - on and off. When on, it has a dim light until the motion sensor picks up movement. It then provides a bright light. This light isn't super bright compared to other lights on the market, but it does provide plenty of light to work by. I like that it provides a dim light at all times when it's dark. It works best in pass-through areas where you want a little light at all times and a brighter light when you're working.We do not get a lot of rain here, but we do have harsh sun and extreme heat. This has held up well to the sun and heat. We get plenty of sun, so it is fully charged by the time the sun sets. Because of this, it provides the light that we need when we need it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EK1E30ZRGT8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UO1DRTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EK1E30ZRGT8B","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this set at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experience with them.I wear my hair up in a top bun most days of the week as it's a quick way to keep my long hair out of my face. Once you get the hang of using these bun makers, they are a quick and easy way to make a secure, classy bun. I like these over the traditional sock method. I like the small bun maker (3"") for my hair, and the large bun maker (4"") works best for my daughter who has thicker hair. The medium bun maker (3.5"") works for both of us.Use is simple. You just put your hair in a ponytail, pull the bun maker to towards the ends of the hair, evenly spread the hair around the bun maker, and slowly roll the bun maker towards your head while tucking and spreading the hair around the bun maker. It takes a few times to really get it down, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy and quick. It holds the bun securely in place.

"While I prefer the from-scratch, simple ingredients of traditional caramel - milk, sugar, butter, I know that most store bought caramel is going to have some preservatives and other ingredients in it, so unless I want to make my own caramel (which I do sometimes), I'll have to deal with at least some added ingredients. This 2.25 lb. tin includes 3 types of caramel soft cremes: caramel, butterscotch and caramel, and caramel and vanilla. The ingredients are:BUTTERSCOTCH AND CARAMEL SOFT CREME INGREDIENTS:CORN SYRUP; SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK (MILK; SUGAR); HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP; PALM KERNEL OIL; SUGAR; GLYCERIN; DAIRY BUTTER (MILK); CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF: GLYCERYL MONOSTEARATE; SALT; NATURAL FLAVORS; LECITHIN (SOY); DISODIUM PHOSPHATE; TOCOPHEROLS (TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS); SODIUM CARBONATE; CARAMEL COLOR; ARTIFICIAL COLOR (YELLOW 5; RED 40; BLUE 1)CARAMEL SOFT CREME INGREDIENTS: SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK (MILK; SUGAR); CORN SYRUP; HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP; PALM KERNEL OIL; SUGAR; CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF: DAIRY BUTTER (MILK); GLYCERYL MONOSTEARATE; SALT; LECITHIN (SOY); DISODIUM PHOSPHATE; SODIUM CARBONATE; TOCOPHEROLS (TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS)VANILLA AND CARAMEL SOFT CREME INGREDIENTS:CORN SYRUP; SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK (MILK; SUGAR); HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP; PALM KERNEL OIL; SUGAR; GLYCERIN; DAIRY BUTTER (MILK); CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF: GLYCERYL MONOSTEARATE; SALT; NATURAL FLAVORS; LECITHIN (SOY); DISODIUM PHOSPHATE; TOCOPHEROLS (TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS); SODIUM CARBONATE; CARAMEL COLOR; ARTIFICIAL COLOR (YELLOW 5; RED 40; BLUE 1)The classic tin looks nice for gift giving or for storage. It's 5 1/4"" tall, 7 1/8"" in diameter, and 22 1/2"" in circumference. Each of the caramels have a slightly different wrapper. The caramel has a solid wide stripe while the other two have small stripes. The butterscotch caramel and vanilla caramel are a little difficult to tell apart as the stripes vary only a little. The wrappers do state the type of caramel in addition to the stripes.The caramels themselves are very soft, and they melt in your mouth. My favorite is the traditional caramel. While I'm not thrilled with all of the ingredients, the caramels still taste good. I prefer a soft, chewy caramel, and these fit the bill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36H7LJXHBWLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","R36H7LJXHBWLC","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can fit small ice cubes in the opening, but not regular size ice cubes.These bottles are a nice way to make sure that you are getting the liquid you need for the day.

"I received a free product in exchange for feedback.I thought this would be a good inexpensive mp3 player for my daughter to take on her trip and toss in her backpack. The idea was that if something happened to it, it wouldn't be a costly loss. She's great about taking care of her things, but stuff can happen when you're constantly on the go.This mp3 player is light weight at only 1.2 oz and small at 3 1/2"" x 1 5/8"" x 3/8"". It has good volume. (No built-in speaker. Must use with headphones or external speaker.) My daughter got nearly 8 hours of use out of a full charge which was actually better than expected. It comes with a 16 gb micro-usb card. This is definitely a plus as a lot of times, you need to purchase the card separately.The buttons are stiff and can be a bit finicky. There are definitely limited options for music as it doesn't have shuffle or random play options. You need to use your computer to organize the songs and put music on the player. We put the albums in different folders, and we also made playlists in different folders. With the technology that we have now, the interface is rather clunky. The screen looks pixelated, so watching video is really not an option even though the ability is there with this player.The mp3 player comes with the necessary mini usb cable. Since virtually everything else we have uses a micro usb cable, it's a bit of a pain to need to carry around a separate cable for this. There are also a set of basic headphones included, but my daughter used her own as she doesn't like the earbud style headphones.What's the verdict? My daughter actually uses this mp3 player on a regular basis. She's found ways to work around the clunky interface that works for her. It's a very basic, lower end mp3 player. In this price range, you can't expect to get all the features that come with a top of the line mp3 player. It's similar to the basic mp3 player that I purchased for myself earlier in the year when I wanted something that I could use in situations where I didn't want to ruin my higher end player.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG57DHCIZNG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOVDSBS#wasThisHelpful","RG57DHCIZNG6","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a small discount on this compost bin to provide feedback based upon my experience with it.Prior to receiving this countertop compost bin, I was using an open bucket for my organic kitchen waste. The problem with this method is the odor and the fact that it attracts bugs. This compost bin has 3 parts plus a filter. It has the main can, the removable plastic can, and the lid. The filter fits inside the lid. The lid just sits on top of the can; it's not a sealed lid. It would have been nice to have a lid that sealed tight, but even without that feature, it does keep the smell inside of the can, and I haven't had any issues with bugs getting into the compost bin.The compost bin is a nice size for the countertop. It's roughly 9.5"" tall with a base diameter of 6.5"". The removable plastic liner makes it easy to empty. Not to mention, the plastic is much easier to clean than metal, and there is no concern of corrosion.The only real issue that I have with this bin is that it has a pink hue rather than being a true red. I really like the compost bin, so I'll probably just repaint it to match the red that I already have in my kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJNI463R7169/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I32WCI#wasThisHelpful","R3PJNI463R7169","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleased when I saw that this mix included millet and teff rather than just using the traditional rice or brown rice flours. If you're used to using rice flours, you'll probably find that the teff and millet smell and taste a little different. My family likes these flours, but not everyone enjoys them. I do think that because teff has a stronger flavor that it works better in savory baked goods rather than sweet baked goods. What this meant for my family is that this muffin mix met with mixed reviews.This is a plain mix, so you'll need to add your own mix-ins. I made both blueberry and chocolate chip muffins. For the first batch, I made them exactly as the directions dictated. The muffins were a little dry but not crumbly. They had a pretty good flavor and texture. The batter was fairly thick, so the next time I added another egg and a little more liquid and used butter instead of coconut oil. This resulted in a more moist, light muffin.I think that this particular muffin mix (with the above mentioned adjustments) would work better for savory muffins rather than the sweet ones that I made. It's not a bad muffin mix, but it wouldn't necessarily be my first choice for muffins either. With the adjustments, it makes an okay sweet muffin that holds together well and isn't dense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Y3U2SPWQV4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOWUUG#wasThisHelpful","R19Y3U2SPWQV4V","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a big hit with our older dog who was experiencing some health issues. It was recommended that he transition from his regular cheaper brand to a brand with better ingredients due to his health issues. By the time that he was fully transitioned to this food, he was feeling better, experiencing a more regular stool, and had more energy. It was a pleasant change. Since he did well with this brand and likes it, the plan is to continue with it. It isn't a grain-free formula, but it appears to still be gentle for a sensitive stomach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37026A5PXIFZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRK9U4#wasThisHelpful","R37026A5PXIFZE","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these produce bags at a discount in exchange for providing feedback based upon my experiences with them.When purchasing these bags, I didn't realize how big they would be - in a good way. The size varies some from bag to bag. The sizes were as follows:15 1/4"" x 11 3/4""14 3/4"" x 12""14 3/4"" x 11 3/4""15"" x 11 3/4""14 1/2"" x 12""They are made of a fine nylon mesh. They have a toggle to secure the cinch sack. Each sack has a different color tag with coordinating cord. The edges were left raw (not surged), so they may unravel in the long term, but so far, they are holding up to use and washing. I would have preferred a finished/surged seam. They can stain if you use them for berries, but this is typical of pretty much all mesh bags. Each bag weighs roughly .57 ounces.

"I purchased this water bottle at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.I've been wanting to try out an infuser bottle for some time, but I didn't really want a plastic bottle. I had never seen a glass infuser bottle locally, so I was pleased to find this one here. It's 20 oz. which is a great size especially for the summer months. While flavored water is great, I'm currently using it to make flavored homemade lemonade. I love being able to add various fruits to the basket without needing to make a syrup to add to the lemonade. Delicious! It also works really nicely for making flavored iced tea which is something my husband enjoys.The silicone sleeve not only protects the bottle, but it also provides extra grip and comfort to the glass bottle. The flip cap is watertight, and I had no issues with leaking even when I was shaking the bottle. The cap, while well made, feels cheaper than the bottle itself. Maybe it's because I've gotten used to using a bottle where the opening is silicone, so it's a little nicer for drinking. The finger loop is a nice feature which I use all the time because of being on crutches.The basket insert is nice, although a bit tricky to clean at times. It's large which means that you can put a good amount of fruit in it, and it goes down quite far into the bottle. It has a small metal handle for easy removal from the bottle. It also has its own cap to keep the fruit contained while you drink. A small gasket keeps it from rubbing around the rim keeps it from rubbing the glass bottle.Overall, I like this glass water bottle with infuser basket. The design is well thought out, and it looks nice. Other than the basket, it's very easy to clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SR8OA34274MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128JKILQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SR8OA34274MZ","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these socks for free in exchange for feedback based upon my experiences with them.Wool socks aren't what they used to be. You can now have comfy wool socks that aren't scratchy. These socks are a blend of 40% wool, 55% polyester, and 5% spandex. They are warm and soft - perfect for the fall and winter weather. They hold their shaped well and thanks to the spandex, they do not fall down. They are good stocks for lounging or hiking. They look cute with low profile boots, but they are a little too short for taller boots like riding or cowboy boots.I wear a size 6.5 shoe, and these socks fit perfectly. They do shrink a little in the wash which is something to keep in mind.My daughter, who is super sensitive to scratchy clothing, thought these socks would be uncomfortable as the outside feels a little scratchy, but after putting them on, she realized that the inside of the socks is actually soft and comfortable.Think ahead to Christmas... these socks would make great stocking stuffers as you can split up the set of 5 pairs and give 1 pair to 5 different people as they are individually packaged.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F11I8L1HQKL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0JTA62#wasThisHelpful","R1F11I8L1HQKL4","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was originally searching for a shark tea infuser for my daughter when I came across this adorable set of manatee tea infusers. I was going back and forth between these and the shark ones when I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my feedback, so I went ahead and purchased the manatees rather than the sharks.I have to give props to the company for their clever play on words with the name of their tea infusers. Calling them Manateas is a fun and playful idea. These expressive, cute silicone manatee tea infusers add a little whimsy to the tea making process. More importantly, they work.The Manateas are easy to fill with your favorite loose tea. My daughter drinks raspberry leaf tea every night. She likes that these are easy to fill, empty, and clean. Emptying them literally just takes a flick of the manatee tail. Because they are silicone, they wash off/out quickly and easily. The holes are a little larger than what you would have with a mesh tea ball but in line with other non-mesh designs. Even so, only a few very small tea leaves made their way into the cup, and honestly, the results were pretty typical of the vast majority of tea balls. My daughter was very pleased that she could have a functional and adorable tea infuser.The Manateas attach to the top of the cup which means they are easy to take out of the cup/mug when you're done steeping the tea.My daughter is thrilled with this set and uses it on a nightly basis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUVR004F2QFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXW3P7K#wasThisHelpful","R2SUVR004F2QFX","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the process of researching solar lights to install the horse stalls as it is starting to get dark earlier, and we need light for taking care of the horses in the evening when I was given the opportunity to purchase this light at a discount to test out and provide feedback based upon my experiences.I like that this light has 3 different settings - off, dim, and high light. I set it on the dim setting, so it would become bright only when the motion sensor was set off. It provides a great deal of light. It floods the hay area, so it was easy to see to feed the horses after dark. Once you stop moving, it goes back to the dim setting. Small animals as well as coyotes due set off the light, so you probably don't want to have this where the light shines directly at your neighbor's window. For us, that's not as issue. The light is very bright, so you don't want to look directly at it at night or you'll experience night blindness.We have mostly sunny days, so the light gets a good charge during the day and lasts throughout the night. We live in the desert, so while tons of rain is not an issue for us, harsh sun and high temps are an issue. So far, the unit is holding up well to the desert environment.The negative with this light is that the switches are on the back of the unit, so once you install the unit with the included screw, you can't change the setting unless you uninstall the light. Screws (included drywall anchors) are included in the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388LM5BYE1GYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YP6173E#wasThisHelpful","R388LM5BYE1GYW","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these towels at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experience with them.Between my husband and my daughter, we have a lot of traveling going on around our house. My husband recently took the large bath towel with him on his trip and fell in love with it. He really appreciated that, even though the towel is very thin, it absorbs a lot of liquid which means it dried him off very quickly. The towel itself dried quickly which is also important when you're on the go. It's soft against the skin and actually gets softer after washing. It takes up very little room and weight in the luggage or backpack - making it the perfect towel for situations where space and weight are at a premium. It comes with a cinch bag that has ventilation at the bottom.The smaller sport towel gets tossed in his pack for when he goes to the gym or takes a run. It's compact, so he doesn't have to worry about it taking up too much valuable space.The bath towel is approximately 51 1/2"" x 31"". The storage bag is 10 1/2"" x 5 3/4"". The bath towel weights roughly 8.2 ounces in the storage bag.The sport towel is approximately 23 1/4"" x 15 1/4"". The storage bag is 7 1/2"" x 4"".

"I had previously purchased the Original Nick's Sticks 100% Grass-Fed Beef Snack Sticks which my family really liked. My husband decided that he wanted to try the spicy version. Like the original version, these sticks are made from grass fed beef and real ingredients. They are also gluten free which is a must for us. The main difference between the spicy sticks and the original is the addition of jalapeno. It adds a little heat, but they aren't super spicy.These beef sticks are tender unlike a lot of beef sticks. They have a nice spicy flavor that isn't overpowering. If you're looking for a lot of heat, then these probably aren't the right beef sticks for you. My husband was thrilled to have some spicy beef sticks to take on his trip as they made a great snack.These beef stick are perfect for hiking, camping, snacks, and travel. I'd feel good about adding them to care packages because they're a healthy version of traditional beef sticks.They aren't cheap, but my entire family is impressed with the flavor and quality of ingredients.

"This 2-piece luggage set is an affordable option for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on luggage. I purchased this for my daughter's cross country trip. She ended up not being able to use the smaller piece as her laptop didn't fit in it, so she used something else instead. She was a little bummed as she really like the owl pattern and wanted to be able to use both pieces.The larger piece is roughly 21"" tall, 12 3/4"" wide, and 9"" deep (without using the expansion option), so it meets the current carry-on luggage requirements. Fitting a week's worth of clothes (without access to laundry facilities) was extremely tight, but we managed to do it. It has two nice size front pockets on the outside and a mesh zippered pocket on the inside. It has the typical option to expand the depth by unzipping one section of the suitcase. It comes with a diary style lock, but it's not a TSA approved lock. It has a pocket on the back to insert your information.The smaller piece is roughly 11"" tall, 14"" wide, and 5 deep (not including the front pocket). It has a loop on the back so you can put it over the telescoping handle of the large piece of luggage. It has both a front pocket and back pocket. As I said before, my daughter's 15"" laptop didn't fit in the bag, so she didn't use this piece.The larger piece held up really well for her trip and shows very little wear. The zippers held up to the suitcase being stuffed a little fuller than it should have been. They still zip smoothly and freely.

The problem we were running into was that while he needed to be able to carry a bigger lunch, he needed a compact style lunch bag. This lunch bag fits the bill.

"As soon as this arrived, my dogs got super excited as the squeak was so enticing (and loud). It is definitely an outside toy, so my daughter and husband took the dogs outside. Unfortunately, the ball was too big for my one dog's mouth, but the other dog had a blast. The size of your dog's mouth is definitely something to consider when deciding whether this is the right ball for you. The ball is 7"" long with a circumference of about 14.25"" at it's widest point.After 3 or so weeks of use, the ball is holding up well against both play and the desert sun and heat. There is very minimal fading of the color. It's gotten softer with the heat.My younger dog, who can't fit the ball in his mouth, still likes to play with the ball as he really likes the squeak it makes. He does get frustrated that he can't get his mouth around it. Of course, the larger dog takes advantage of it and swipes the ball now and again.

It really does help with the fatigue that comes with being on your feet for extended periods of time.You don't need to worry about the mat moving around as it has some weight and grip to it.

The double bowls hold roughly 1 1/2 cups of food/water each while the single bowl holds just under 2 cups of food/water. Also included is a carabener clip and a piece for attaching the single bowl to a water bottle. If you, like us, use reusable water bottles, then the water bottle piece won't really be of use to you as it is meant strictly for the disposable plastic water bottles. The double bowl is roughly 13 1/2"" X 5 1/2"". It is around 1/2"" thick when collapsed and 2 1/4"" thick when expanded. The single bowl is a little over 5"" in diameter and 1/2"" thick collapsed and 2 1/4"" thick expanded.The double bowl is nice when you have two dogs as both dogs can drink at the same time. For us, this is more of a travel bowl for the vehicle or camping rather than backpacking. We can't use a double bowl for food as the dogs need to be separated by a few feet to avoid them trying to eat each other's food. It also didn't work so well for food/water combo as the food ended up in the water. It did work great when we needed to give both dogs water at the same time. The single bowl works well for tossing in a pack. Both the double and single bowl are light weight.My dogs really like the bowls and have no issue drinking out of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TMTC9JRS5GKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126UEW1E#wasThisHelpful","R1TMTC9JRS5GKD","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.I got this for my daughter as she wanted something that was light weight and comfortable that would provide some modesty under some of her shirts/dresses. The lace detailing is stretchy and comfortable. She's sensitive to things that are scratchy, and this doesn't bother her at all. This isn't a highly supportive bra, so she wears a bra under it. She wears this more like a camisole.My daughter is about 5'5"" and 120 pounds. It fits her just right. I'm also able to wear it at 5'2"" and 135 pounds.

"Since we don't have a crushed ice feature on our ice maker, I wanted to find an ice cube tray that would create small ice cubes. While not quite as good as using crushed ice, these ice cubes do a good job.I've been using these trays for roughly a 1 1/2 years and haven't had any issues with breaking or cracking. Once the ice cubes are completely frozen, they (for the most part) pop out very easily. Because we like to use a lot of these ice cubes, I empty all of the ice cubes into a tub and make more. If some of the ice cubes don't come out, I run a little water over the bottom of the tray and the rest of the ice cubes release.Because these ice cubes are so small, they don't take very long to freeze.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PS6YJJ1Q4N01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ML0YVE#wasThisHelpful","R2PS6YJJ1Q4N01","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this silicone mold set at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.This fun silicone mold set includes 5 molds: 2 Lego brick molds that feature 10 bricks each, 2 Lego figure molds that feature 8 figures each, and a heart mold that features 15 hearts. I'm attaching pictures for size comparison between real Lego bricks and figures and the chocolate version.The Lego brick molds are perfect for making your own mini candy bars in the shape of Lego bricks. We had a blast making a variety of candy bars - plain chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, coconut chocolate, and nut chocolate. They're a perfect snack size. We just melted the chocolate and spooned them into the molds. For the add-ins, we mixed them into the chocolate prior to spooning it into the mold. Once the chocolate set up, it was easy to pop the chocolate out of the molds.The Lego figure molds are just plain fun. While I did solid color chocolate for our figures, you could easily make them multiple colors. If you're really motivated, you could paint details onto the figures. Once the chocolate was in the molds, I tapped the mold on the counter a few times to get any bubbles out of the chocolate. After the chocolate sets up, it's easy to pop the chocolates out of the mold.I could have made heart chocolates, but I decided to make fun molded butter instead. The hearts are the perfect size for a pat of butter to serve with a stack of pancakes. I allowed butter to come to room temperature and then pressed it into the molds until the heart cavities were filled. It probably would have been easily to melt the butter first, but I didn't think about that until after the fact. I placed the mold into the fridge to allow the butter to harden. Once hardened, the heart-shaped butter easily released from the molds. I just store them in an air-tight container in the fridge to keep them fresh.This really is a fun set of silicone molds. They are easy to clean as you can just invert them for cleaning. You don't need to use a releasing agent. You can also use them as ice cube trays, if desired. Since I want to use these for food, I did not test them out for making crayons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6E1VY8BU8UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FXATVG#wasThisHelpful","R2F6E1VY8BU8UA","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these mini hot water bottles for times when I didn't need a full size hot water bottle.These mini hot water bottles are adorable. They are perfect for soothing bumps, bruises, aches, and pains. I've used them with both hot water and with ice water. The screw off lid is leak proof and allows for easy filling of the water bottle. The filling hole is on the small side, so if you want to use ice, you'll need to break the ice up or use small ice cubes. (I like to use the ice cubes made with the Arrow Plastic 00055 Ice Cube Trays.) The fun designs are great for kids or for someone who just wants a water bottle that has some flair.You receive 4 mini hot water bottles, but which ones you receive is random. Each hot water bottle measures 7"" x 4.5"". The portion you fill is roughly 4.5"" x 4"".The hot water bottles do smell when you first remove them from the packaging, so you'll want to air them out prior to use. I just set them aside for a few days in an area where the smell wouldn't bother me. I then gave them a quick wash prior to use which took care of all of the residual smell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VVOJ8SGB8TM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKYQM8M#wasThisHelpful","R1VVOJ8SGB8TM4","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These dog toys are adorable, but we're not giving them to our dogs. Our dogs would destroy these soft, stuffed toys in less than a day. (We had previously purchased one of these locally, and it didn't last an hour before the stuffing was out and the voice box was being tossed about.)For Angry Bird fans, these are fun stuffed toys. They can be tossed around without concern of hurting someone as they are really soft. They have voice boxes that make the classic angry bird sounds. Our red bird was missing his voice box, but we're keeping the set anyway as we needed these for an activity right away. The voice boxes move around inside of the stuffing, so you sometimes need to find it if you want to hear the noise.While I wouldn't recommend these for pets if your pup likes to pull the stuffing out of toys, I would recommend them for an Angry Bird fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SKHTXE1M1IMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2B86LK#wasThisHelpful","R2SKHTXE1M1IMU","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a discount on this yoga towel to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.The Joyne Tola Non-Slip Yoga towel is a generous 67.5"" x 23.5"" which means it's just a little smaller than the Joyne Serenity Non-Slip Yoga Mat. The waffle-weave fabric is comfortable to the touch while allowing you to maintain control of the poses. The other side of the waffle-weave fabric has lots of little grippies to keep the towel from sliding on the floor or yoga mat.I'm currently not doing very rigorous moves due to an injury, but it stays firmly in place when doing the basic poses that I'm working on during my recovery. Having non-slip stability is critical for me right now as I do not need to make my injury worse.The towel is fairly absorbent.

"I received this yoga mat at a discount to provide feedback based upon my experiences with it.The Joyne Serenity Non-Slip Mat is a generous 68"" x 24"" x 1/4"" which gives plenty of room to do pretty much all poses. It stays firmly in place on both hard and soft surfaces. The 1/4"" thickness provides a good amount of cushion.I was thankful that this yoga mat did not have a strong chemical smell which has been an issue with some of my other yoga mats in the past. For safety reasons, it's important to wash the mat prior to use - especially if you're using it without a yoga towel. While this is a non-slip mat, it does have some residue that needs to be washed off prior to using it for the first time. I like to use a yoga towel with my yoga mats as it keeps my mat a little cleaner. It's easy to toss yoga towels in the wash.

"I received a free set of trekking poles to provide my feedback based upon my experience with the product.Both my husband and I have retractable trekking poles, but my teenage daughter didn't have a set. Since she isn't a hard core user, we didn't want to spend a lot of money, but we also wanted something that was going to be durable. These poles seem to fit the bill for us.When collapsed, the trekking poles are roughly 22"" long. When fully extended, they are roughly 53.5"" long. While they are quite sturdy at shorter heights, they have a lot of give in them when they are fully extended. This is fairly normal with trekking poles which is why, when we shopped for poles for my tall husband, we went with poles that were meant specifically for taller individuals.The poles can be used with or without the bells. They can be used with or without the rubber tips. What tips you use depends completely on the terrain where you are hiking.We all liked the anti-shock feature with these poles. The grip is comfortable and the strap has a soft interior. The edges of the wrist strap can be a little scratchy if you don't get them positioned just so. My daughter is really sensitive, so she just used the poles without the wrist strap. (This was the case with our other poles as well.)These are a good set of trekking poles for this price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37B665IEDNEOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6W16VY#wasThisHelpful","R37B665IEDNEOW","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love our Schleich dinosaurs, horses, and animals around here. This is the updated version of the Schleich Gigantosaurus that my daughter had purchased several years ago. Since the size and style was different, she wanted to add it to her collection. This dinosaur measures approximately 9"" x 4"" x 6 3/4"".The proportions on this newest version are actually better than the previous version. This one is definitely more colorful. My daughter feels that, while the new color scheme is nice, this dinosaur is missing the depth created with paint in the more colorful areas that some of the other dinosaurs exhibit. The less colorful areas have more depth and realism. The molded detail is wonderful.The jaw on the Giganotosaurus opens and shuts. The tongue is 3 dimensional, and there is a lot of detail shown in the mouth. The eyes have a shine to them which makes them more realistic. The dinosaur is heavy and not hollow which makes it more durable.If it gets dirty with play, it's easy to clean. It's great for all ages whether they use it as a toy, a display piece, or a model for drawing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOLKGR3TG7VG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PESY41Y#wasThisHelpful","R2BOLKGR3TG7VG","A3SD3E6FIS6CS9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SD3E6FIS6CS9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a discount on this portable power bank to provide feedback based upon my personal experience with it.This portable power bank is small enough to toss in my purse/pack at only 4"" x 2.5"" x 1"" (rough measurement).

"This book by Robyn Carr, and part of the Thunder Point series, revolves around Lanie Carrington, an FBI agent from previous books that I have not read (but will!). Laine is recovering from a gunshot wound in Thunder Point. There she meets Eric Gentry and sparks fly.I absolutely loved the character of Laine. She is all kinds of kick ass and does not mind letting people know she can take care of herself. I love reading about confident and strong women. She is no damsel in distress. She will kick down doors, take names and let you know how outmatched you are. For me, she just made this book a must read.Eric is a good character. His worry over Laine's ability to protect herself is not born out of a chauvinistic mentality, but a real worry that she has a dangerous job, might get hurt (HAS gotten hurt) and he might lose her.I love how the relationship started and progressed. It was a very mature and level headed relationship (with all the hotness that these two created). It was a well written book and an enjoyable read.

"This is the first book I read by this author. Elise is a Dominant and is unapologetic about it. For her it is an integral part of who she is, not just what she likes. But, Niall does not enjoy that kink. How do they come together and live happily ever after?This is a well written book. The problem with the book is the pacing. It wasn't until page 102 (out of 348) that we finally meet Niall. It just took too long. The author put a lot of effort (and pages) into giving us a full picture of Elise. Her likes, dislikes, wok, relationships, etc. During the first third of the book she is with another guy (sort of).We get to know Elise in detail, a lot. Her views are fully mapped and explored. It is great character development but it did not have to occupy the entirety of the first third of the book. It made the story drag quite a bit.Once we get past two thirds of the book, the story gets a bit better. It is not a page turner, more like a slow burn of a book.

"I was skeptical of this product when I first received it. It is VERY lightweight and, honestly, just looked and felt a bit cheaply made. And it may have been, but it still works very well.This is a simple voice recorded that has a lot of extra features (you can transfer files into it). It has a decent microphone that picks up the recorded voice with decent clarity. I would use this for a meeting in a pinch if I had to. I have also used it for note taking whilst reading briefs and cases. The buttons are clearly marked and the main buttons (record, play and stop) are impossible to miss.You have to be near the microphone for it to properly record the voice. It won't work as well if not. So, if you are recording people that are far away (you are at the edge of a room whilst in a conference) than you should employ another recording device.This is a good recorded if you have clear and reasonable expectations. Do you want to be able to record meetings or your voice? Then this is a good, reasonably priced alternative. Do you want to record whilst in big conference rooms, get something else. The quality of the recording is just ok. Don't try to record people singing and expect to be able to have a good quality playback.Overrall, a great product.*Complimentary product provided for the purpose of a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFH7NBCUFLHZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9SI8IE#wasThisHelpful","RFH7NBCUFLHZT","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The closure is magnetic.It looks really nice and the stitching is well done and even.*Complimentary product was provided for purpose of a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXY8209B0IHYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2B5N6W#wasThisHelpful","RXY8209B0IHYC","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a relatively inexpensive mouse that works just fine. The box describes it as an elegant and ergonomic design. It is not elegant at all. It has more of a rugged look and it is yellow. The ergonomics are ok, not too bad, but it is not long enough to provide adequate palm support. If that is an issue for you, you should look elsewhere.The pointer is really fast of the box and I had to adjust the settings.*Complimentary item provided for the purpose of a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHJRH1VZF14N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OROC04Y#wasThisHelpful","R2AHJRH1VZF14N","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the same clear plastic rings since 2005. I was ready for a change. I liked these rigns when I saw them. They provide a nice accent  and style to the curtain. They are easy to use and install and I was able to quickly hook it all up. The rings allow the curtain to hang about 1/2 inch more than the rings I previously had. I like this.The shower hooks have small roller beads on top that allow for the rings to slide easily through the rod without encountering much friction like the plastic would. It is a bit noisy but that's ok, it doesn't bother me.I really like these rings and I expect them to last quite a long time.UPDATE: 6/15/2015 - Well, I have been using these rings for about a month. It only took a couple of weeks for the rings to start ripping though my shower liner. These rings are very thin at the bottom. So much so that it acts like a cutting edge and it causes the shower liner to rip. By week 1 I could see tears forming in two places. By week 3, one of them had torn though. This is not something that has happened with other rings in my experience. Using these rings may lower the longevity of your shower liners if each hole is not lined with metal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGY6UG3TTDUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTDO8ZA#wasThisHelpful","R1EGY6UG3TTDUK","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sturdy water bottle that is convenient and spill-proof. This is for kids and non-kids as well! I have been using this water bottle for about a week now. I have largely stayed away from bottles with straws because it is just one other thing to clean and another place for dirt and germs to hide. If you need a straw, then this is a great water bottle. If you do not, then I would consider getting another of the many choices this brand carries.The designs on the bottles are great and make me feel upbeat and happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7NHXR2KTM523/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNXCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R7NHXR2KTM523","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
